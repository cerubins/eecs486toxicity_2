It doesn’t look like charity follows anyone from Zach’s season
Is it possible that filming for her season started so quickly after Zach’s season that she hasn’t had time to follow people from it?
There seems to be some kind of rule you cant follow other contestants until you're eliminated. So it seems charity was already doing bachelorette stuff that Monday tuesday, but idk why Ariel hasnt yet lol
i think they got control over her account so she can’t follow people
Wow even Brooklyn? That was her best friend on the season
I see Charity hasn't followed her cast mates from Zach's season on IG. Only follows Susie Evans, Taylor Hale (BB 24 winner), Becca Kufrin and Michelle Young.
I think you’re right. I could have sworn I saw that Charity and most of the girls were following each other a while back but I must be mistaken
Nope! But she was announced on WTA and I think they started filming very shortly after it was aired, and ik the women couldn’t follow eachother until it aired. She may just not have had time tbh. I think she’ll prob follow people after her season is done filming
Ah makes sense!
This isn’t her house she commented she’d never expose her real front yard to the public like that lol
You must not be from LA because this house is very LA lol
It’s in a photo dump, I highly doubt she posted her actual house, it’s probably just a cute one she saw. I’m also not sure what LA like means considering this is a gigantic city with tons of different areas, but it is a very cute place
I’m Obsessed but like not safe for her to post that
I feel bad for the person that actually lives in this house since now apparently the internet misinterpreted this as her house 🫣
This is very LA! The spiky tree (I'm not a botanist but those are everywhere in Los Angeles), the tiled pathway, the clay roof. Looks like WeHo or Fairfax.
i cannot believe she posted her literal front door on instagram. girl…  edit: it’s not her house but i still feel bad for the person whose house it is for losing their privacy a bit.

All the houses in my area of LA look just like this lol
Very cute, very LA, but Jesus Christ the rent on that must be a lot.
It’s absolutely beautiful lol. People are always so judgmental, I would love to see where they live/what they look like/the type of person they are, etc.
Or Hansel and Gretel  But damn I love California. It also has an English cottage vibe. Except it's ☀️  ![gif](giphy|DD4FroTT30PeSamZbG)  Not this
It’s right off Melrose. Photos of the inside are online if you search it by that photo. Such a cute property! *edit to add if you didn’t see the other comments this isn’t her house :)*
LA could really use more ivy
this is SO BEAUTIFUL but am i the only one concerned about what the façade is made of?  doing a deep dive on the affects of climbing plants now, apparently sometimes it’s actually good? but sometimes also leads to rot (which is what i always heard but i guess it depends on the material + sun exposure)  i would totally follow more influencers if they went into the nerdy details of the content they share lol
Love this compared to the cold boxy homes popping up in LA. If you love historic or architecturally significant properties, check out GLB properties!
Spiders
It's very fairytale! Where is this?
So cute. I love how much this contrasts with the typical super new and contemporary style most BN people gravitate to
That is so cute
I thought the same thing when I saw the house 😂😂 but I like it, it’s cute!! And I think it’s probably nice that she has a lower key place in LA… she can experience the LA life when she wants but also be low key and live in her storybook looking house when she wants to chill
But isn't that easy to see and get these days on the internet?
Damn Ashley Nicole is savage 💀
That’s what I’m saying lol. It’s adorable and looks like a bunch of adorable neighborhoods in LA
I’m guessing Hancock Park or West Hollywood
That's what I said. Hansel and Gretel
Agreed 💯
Maybe Pasadena
ya looks very Pasadena ish to me
Demi has actually concerned me for awhile now tbh. For about a year I’ve been seeing some signs that are just unsettling imo. I think she’s not okay.   Also on the surface issue of money, the reality is some of these influencers are going to have to realize that IG money isn’t what it once was, especially if you aren’t “relevant” in what you got famous for anymore. You have a good 2-3 years to make a name for yourself outside  of the show then I feel like that fanbase lessens a ton.   Demi is obviously dealing with a lot of issues, a lot maybe stemming from her autism but also I think she is one who REALLY bought into her own hype… which is why I think being the loved contestant is maybe even worse than being the hated one… at least with being the hated/controversial contestants you literally just want the hate comments to go away so you’re prob relieved when they do. With being the contestant that people hype up, I think it hits harder when people don’t care anymore.   I hope Demi gets the help she needs
I feel for her, especially since it doesn’t seem like she has supportive friends and family around her. It’s really sad.   But in times of financial crisis, you do what you gotta do. Jobs in retail or food services are often available. Take one so you can get steady on your feet. Might help to also move out of LA. I hope she gets the help she so clearly needs right now.
Follow Katie Thurston and sell feet photos
Very concerning. I don’t think it’s her looking for attention, I think she’s having a very real mental health crisis and has been for awhile.   The last line in particular line in particular scares me “I can do a lot of things, I might surprise you” I truly hope nobody takes advantage of her and I hope she gets the help she needs
i say this every single post, she needs to leave LA. i'm not even saying she needs to stop a public life (i'm assuming there are reality ahows that will take her) LA is for hustlers and successful people, it is extremely expensive and the relationships are often transactional. is there a reason she can't just return to Dallas/where she grew up?
This makes me wonder if most influencers are just putting everything on credit cards and they don’t make as much money as we think. Not naming names, but some of them seem very irresponsible with their money and they’re spending it like influencers don’t get replaced every year. It’s crazy how Demi went from being front and center to this.   You need a financial advisor, Demi!
What does she mean "I am willing to share all earnings". Like she makes money and then gives it away?
She has 948k followers seems like she should be able to be able to make some money shilling Home Chef or Dime Beauty like a lot of the other women from the show.
She needs to move out of LA and get offline. She may not be money motivated but she is attention motivated.
She has 950k instagram followers theres no way she cant sell some hair pills or something.
I don’t mean to me rude or insensitive… but why isn’t she asking all of her super rich friends instead of her fans? Isn’t she close with Nick? Like.. I don’t know begging random strangers for money seems really weird. Hopefully she can get help.
I mean... get a job? I'm out here struggling too gal.
Not so long ago she posting an ad needing a personal assistant who is able to put up with her mood swings?   Perhaps she needs to talk to a financial advisor to cut certain spending.
Wasn’t she close to Nick Viall, Hannah, and Katie? Are they no longer friends with her?
I know she doesn’t have much of a filter with things but I gotta imagine things are pretty bad to be blasting a call for help like this. I hope she gets the help she needs… it seems like she’s had a lot of these types of cries for help on Twitter.
if she's really broke, can't she do some part time job at the side, rather than just depending on influencing money? I don't think part time jobs are difficult to come by these days.
People who follow her: is this coming out of the blue or has she been in a bad place mental health-wise recently? This reads like a cry for help rather than just needing cash . . .
I’m so happy I have a 9-5. I could never be an influencer.
Now she posted on her Instagram stories that she is looking for a manager/agent/talent rep that is neurodivergent friendly. Did she not have a rep before?
If you're willing to work, get a stable 9-5 job sis. She makes the same kind of posts every few months. You can't piggyback off of 3 minor reality tv appearances you made a few years ago for the rest of your life... Unless she gets cast for a show like The Challenge where contestants often return season after season. Although I don't think this industry is good for her in general.
This is extremely stressful & sounds dangerous
What was she doing before the show? She's never had a job or what?
Why won’t she move? Somewhere cheaper at least. You can influence and live in an affordable area. Demi scares me because it seems like she can’t leave her apartment due to anxiety. LA seems to be a really unhealthy place for her, why stay there?
She’s broke. It happens. I don’t know who would help her make money for free though.
What did she do before the show? I know she was super young but what was her “title”?
That’s really sad to hear, I hope she finds work! Living in LA is not easy. I forget what her family situation is with her dad but hopefully she has a financial safety net. it’s extremely scary having no one to turn to when things fall apart.
Do people from BN forgot how to apply for a job like the rest of us? All of a sudden, as soon as you’re a BN alum, it’s a shame to go back to a regular 9-5 job and live a normal non-influencer life? Im sorry girl but maybe you need to wait some tables first like the rest of us while you work toward your ideal influencer career.  Learn the value of money like the rest of us. 🤷🏻‍♀️
She should’ve gotten on roomies a long time ago for a second roommate.
sometimes people need to hit rock bottom to make a change. if someone swoops in and saves her, she wont learn. join DoorDash and UberEats if youre desperate. theres a LOT of crappy work people do when they're young and struggling. usually some of the most amazing growth in life comes from these moments. buckle down and start working hard like an adult. Demi seems incredibly immature and wasting money on her lifestyle. only way you learn/grow is falling on your face.
What about LoriK?
LA is a cesspool and bachelor nation has become one too. I know she had a troubled family life or maybe just her mom? I really hope she has some pre fame people she can go back too  Demi always seemed like a sweet soul to me. And those types will always struggle. And the money is running out   Frankly she’s one of the few with the personality to be an influencer but she needs help/direction
Sending her lots of love and I hope she gets the help that she needs
Ziprecruiter.com time to get a real 9-5 job, methinks.
I feel for Demi since I know part of the challenge is probably navigating how to reconcile her diagnosis and challenges with the effort probably needed to support what she has been traditionally doing for income. Add the cost of living in LA and I am sure it has been struggle. I think she has potential with her interest in gaming and streaming, but I am not sure if the regular content creation and interaction needed for that is something she is comfortable doing now.
This is a blatant cry for help and people are saying “do x”, “do y”, “do z”. She needs legit mental healthcare not pointless advice. Just express some sympathy
Some people who are autistic have issues finding and keeping “traditional” jobs. Not sure if this applies to Demi at all but yeah. It’s rough for a lot of ppl out there. Hope she finds a solution ♥️
Therapy and a job. Boom.
Maybe she can rent a room in Chris Harrison’s house?
So sad, her behavior reminds me of Amanda Bynes 😳 she had a somewhat promising career, at least influencing
Shouldn’t it be easy for her to shill online?
She posted she bought a 150 dollar chair last month .. I don’t sympathize sorry
do a lot of you not know that demi has autism? she specifically has the pathological demands avoidance profile, which means it’s incredibly stressful to do things she feels like she has to do, ie make money. it’s not as easy as just “finding a job” for her. what she really needs is a great support system and i really hope she finds it 💞
I just think moving out of California can solve a lot of financial issues. Source: am a Californian
Right. Katie was the Bachelorette and is now selling her toes for 16 dollars a pop so clearly everybodys struggling.
People with decent followings selling feet photos and even doing bikini photos on OF are making sometimes close to 100k a month if they are creative and post regularly. Even smaller followings I have heard 50k a month. I wouldn’t blame someone who is still getting sponsor money for doing it for that kind of rainy day money.
100% agreed with all of this
I honestly cannot fathom the amount of money you’d have to pour into simply LOOKING a certain way in those circles within LA. It’s not that tough to make a living in LA, but it seems nearly impossible to do it when you’re also shelling out $1000-2000/month on whatever treatments keep you looking polished for the gram.
Who have you noticed being irresponsible with their money. I'm genuinely curious because no one really comes to mind for me. I remember people being shocked that HG and Dylan bought a $3 million house but HG is a pretty successful influencer/model and Dylan comes from money so I wouldn't say that was irresponsible (plus the market value will go up anyways).
She doesn’t even need a financial advisor. In fact, most people don’t. Just basic money management skills.
Sounds like she’s willing to pay commissions to reps or producers if they help her.
She’s willing to give someone a cut on everything she earns
Ya how can someone with that many followers be not financially secure?
I heard she lost her sponsorships after saying that she’s autistic
Absolutely! It sounds like she is in a really mentally unhealthy place. And LA is horrible for that.
also, in order to have money and make a living, one needs to be somewhat money-motivated. I do not make a lot of money, but I am still money motivated in that I need to pay rent and afford to live. it's okay to be motivated by money
I’m pretty sure she has isolated herself from her former friends.  I think she’s super unwell. I can’t speak for her friends, but sometimes you can only do so much for someone.
I don’t think she’s asking for money I think she’s asking for advice on how to monetize and market herself
Lol, nick would probably push someone in a burning house to save himself. There’s no way he would give someone money and if he did, he would definitely hold it over them. She might have asked her friends for help privately, but don’t think any of her Bachelor friends are actually true friendships unfortunately.
Her best friend from the show is HB and HB ghosted her
Seriously, way too many people (especially from BN) simply cannot conceive of actually working a job. I have zero empathy for their obsession with making money just from existing publicly. The majority of us work full time or more and still struggle in markets more forgiving than LA, so cry me a river, Demi.
Demi is delusional, I'm sorry. People baby her like crazy here because she's neurodivergent like 20% of the population. She put out an ad a while back for a "personal assistant" that was basically asking for an on-call therapist and 24/7 emotional support animal.   She has over a million followers, she could put the work into utilizing her platform or get a normal job and a more affordable apartment instead of her two-story LA condo if she's struggling. Instead she frequently posts on social media about not being able to pay her bills and begging for handouts. Girl get on Craigslist like everyone else in the world or walk into literally any restaurant in LA that will hire you on the spot.
katie lives in england currently but they seemed close before she moved there, she was also close with HG and dylan but idk if they still are, i saw somewhere maybe an interview or podcast that she’s invited to their wedding so possibly they are still close with her
There are lots of restaurant jobs out there but I think being on reality tv convinces people that the normal rules of economics don’t apply to them.
I don’t follow her, but her tweets come up in my feed from time to time. She has talked about having money issues before.
I don’t follow her, but I remember a couple weeks ago someone posted her here and I went to her page and in her comments she responded to someone and said she was getting evicted from her apartment, so this particular issue doesn’t seem to be new… I also recall posts here about her not having money for awhile now, same thing with her mental health.
I’m pretty sure she used to, I didn’t know that was over
You’re right, she should try to get on a new show. They take reality stars from old seasons all the time.
I think she's going to be on this upcoming season of BIP Canada.
I remember they listed her career as “interior designer”, but later she said she was just working at pottery barn and they spun that title to make her seem more fancy, Classic bachelor
I think they called her an “interior designer” but she worked at pottery barn
THIS. if she cant handle that schedule, theres a million side hustle type jobs she could do on her own schedule that she picks as well.
She has a neurodevelopmental disability that effects executive functioning. Many people with autism struggle to carry out complex tasks with multiple steps, which is exactly what applying for a job is. More than 3/4 of autistic adults are unemployed where I live, likely because they need workplace supports that aren't available.   Invisible disabilities are still disabilities. And while I wouldn't say an autistic person couldn't wait tables, that particular job requires soft social skills that many autistic people struggle with. I care for a young adult with autism who won't even eat in a busy restaurant, let alone work in one.
I mean you’re right and that’s surely the road that any of them who can’t make as an influencer will Inevitably go down.  Still sympathetic. She’s been out of the work force for 4ish years and likely has “nut” that’s going to be hard to walk back from   If at the point they renter the work force it’s going to mean essentially starting out like someone just out of college. Which will make it impossible for her to keep up with the social network she built.  She can surely come back from here but I imagine from the the tweet she’s on the precipice of some tough years.
> Im sorry girl but maybe you need to wait some tables first like the rest of us while you work toward your ideal influencer career.  No need to act like serving is a lowly profession that people should endure before real “careers”
This thank you. While I agree she needs therapy, she needs to learn the value of money too like the rest of us. But looks like I see people here willing to bend over for her and make excuses for her, thinking it would save her. If she sets up a GoFund me to ask fans to help her, I’m pretty sure there’s going to be a lot of fans who will donate to make sure she’s ok. If I do it, I’ll be lucky to even get $1 from a stranger. And I have family members who have to depend on food stamps and Medicaid because they are really struggling even with their minimum wage jobs even while having a therapist, not tweeting out to millions of fans for money or how to get money.
I've come to realize gamer streaming is incredibly high stress. I watch a lot of guy streamers with my husband, so everything from Elden Ring to Among Us to Pokemon to CoD,  and the amount of hours they put in and especially with the CoD/Fortnite/Apex streams, toxic players and viewers. I've seen even the chillest, nicest dudes just flip on chat or seem just so exhausted. I genuinely don't know if Demi would be in a mental place to handle that without a lot of therapy first.
I think she also might have rejection sensitivity disphoria which might make getting content creation going hard
I get it but no one on twitter or social media can help her with that. she needs to reach out to her therapist or her family and vice versa for that.
This. Severe Mental illness makes it impossible to hold down any job. Forget trying to get help in our fucked us healthcare system and try to apply and interview for jobs
It’s very common, I am autistic and have had many issues holding down jobs due to my inability with others. Luckily I am employed now in a place where I am allowed to be a little kooky (after a very long struggle —and that’s with “doing my best”) but one of my autistic friends is going through this exact same thing at 60 despite being a very talented architect—it doesn’t get easier because there’s no “recovery”, you always are who you are at the end of the day and that frequently is as the wrong shaped peg. I hope the best for her.
I was going to say this. As a ND person who struggles with money and work, these posts make me so sad
I don't think she's doing well as an influencer.
That’s not a lot for a chair…
Chairs are hella expensive, that's a steal haha
Her mom bought that for her.
Yes, she should sit on the floor 🙄 /s
There’s non-profit organizations and employers out there who work with recruiters to find jobs that are neuro-divergent friendly or for people with intellectual/developmental disabilities to get a stable career, not even a minimum wage job, I’m talking about a stable career. I used to work for one and one of the administrative managers who started that non-profit organization had a neurodevelopmental disability. They even helped with tuition reimbursements and paying for college to help advance your career. Theres financial advising companies that help with people with developmental/intellectual disabilities, especially those with very little support. I see comments here that share same experiences as well. The resources are out there, but I do believe there needs to be better awareness on it.
I actually understand her. The “I’m not money driven” is real for many people, especially neurodivergent people and it’s dangerous for sure because before they know it that banks account is at $0.00, but I wonder why she stopped content creating. You can work from home and at your own pace when you do content creating. Seems like the perfect job for someone with different needs and skills. You don’t have to deal with people if you don’t want to or leave your house. She has the following which is the hardest part.   I really wonder what happened. Wishing her well. This position she’s is is complicated but people won’t see it because she was on this show.
I don’t know the specifics but it all comes down to folllowers, likes and engagement… which has significantly done down in recent years. Demi is from the age of the show that got 1M followers for being blonde and pretty and/or funny. So I imagine rarely getting 10k likes on a pic now  is a shock to the system
So I’m not in the industry, but at peak someone who was in the industry said you could estimate yearly earnings based on followers- basically 50 cents to buck per follower, assuming that the person has decent engagement and works consistently.
I mean I have a niece who thinks she is an influencer.  She gets free products to promote but then has to pay taxes on all of it.
I think she’s from the south. She should return immediately
also "influencer culture" has really diluted talentless people into thinking they have a sustainable life in LA. i don't blame them for cashing in when they have their 15 mins of fame. but many buy into their own hype. Demi had repeatedly done public cries for help about how she is struggling to make money influencing, ok then... go do something else. people with real skills make 30k a year, it's wild how they lose perspective.  and i can't believe i am going to reference Blake on this, but people like Blake H with his DJing have spun their 15 mins into other careers, and thus their influencer lifestyle can kind of get new life bred into it. Demi had a career of reality tv appearances and posting cute photos like THAT market alone is way over saturated
Ohhh I see. I thought she was saying that's why she's broke because she "shares all her earnings".
That’s so sad :(
Because the companies are ableist? That’s sad
What? Do we know which companies dropped her?
that’s so awful if true :(
Yea what is she talking about?? this reminds me of a girl i knew saying she “wasn’t really a numbers person” so didn’t know how much the rent was at her apartment 😭😭 i was like girl i wish i didn’t have to be a numbers person
Ah. There’s a TikTok of her with a bunch of bachelor people recently that’s why I was confused. I know she has autism and it’s a recent diagnosis, but she does seem very very unwell.
She might very well be working a regular job but still not making enough. I took this to mean she was asking for management type help too.
I don't think they've spoken in years. Also from Hannah's perspective, it's very likely Demi trash talked her to Nick Viall. So I don't think Demi has been the best friend to her.
what oh no when was that?
That's pretty telling.
Exactly this. You can't force the public to like you. She's been very open about not being successful as an influencer over the last few months. And crying out to social media about how you're about to lose your apt & whatnot isn't going to help, but only make it worse i fear.
She’s no longer close w Hannah b?
yeah, idk what's her actual situation is, but I would look for a second stream of income like a part-time job FIRST before tweeting out an SOS like that.
Yeah, I remember her talking about being broke and relying on her neighbors to buy her food. This is a really tough situation. I hope she has somewhere to go, even if it means leaving LA (which might be good for her in the long term).
Usually contestants retain an agent after coming off a reality show (if they make it far) to help them get other opportunities. I assume she can't really afford one right now, hence this post. Like others have said, she needs to get out of LA, then she needs to save up some money for an agent if she ever wants to get on another show.
Lol that show. But still, then she has worked so... Why everyone insists it's hard for her. There are resources for people with her diagnosis too. Why such kiddy gloves with her....
I am in no way trying to shit on people who work at pottery barn, but calling her an interior designer because of that is such a reach lmao the titles really mean nothing huh
Gotcha. Thanks! (Off topic but ur profile pic is sending me lmao)
Autism is a spectrum. There are many people on that spectrum that live independently, apply for jobs,can wait tables, or work professional jobs that could never ever do something like the Bachelor Film schedule.   Just like all of us, people on the spectrum can fall on hard times. It’s counter productive to say they’re incapable of doing something that isn’t half as hard as what they’ve already done.   If this post came after years of being unable to hold service jobs it’d be different, but I think it’s kinda condescending to say when she’s literally not tried to do that yet and all evidence we have says she could.
Didn't she have a job before she applied to be on the show? I believe she worked in retail. Somehow she managed to have a job before she was famous?
She needs to hop on Indeed.com
Like families who have lost their small businesses that they built from ground zero, sometimes life just happens. While I can be sympathetic for her not affording her apartment and influencer lifestyle anymore, she needs to let life to happen and sometimes fall like all the families who tried their hardest to keep their small businesses open. Same goes with many respectable entertainers who can’t get a gig anymore, and they just have to find other ways to survive until the next big thing to bring them back in. Take recent Oscar winner Ke Huy Quan, now everyone from Martin Scorsese to Steven Spielberg wants to give him all the big movie roles!
It’s not a lowly position at all sorry if it came across that but it seems like it’s not in her radar to even try as she told us that all she’s been trying is influencing gigs that aren’t working out for her financially. I truly value service workers and that they should be way more valued and this is why this post irks me. If service jobs were valued more, we won’t see influencers complaining why they are losing followers or can’t afford their influencer lifestyle anymore.
Just look at her stories and weird videos, it reminds me of Amanda when she started spiraling. I get that Demi has autism, but something else is off. I wish her the best though, she was my fave :(
She’s not on tiktok at least. Her views recently have been super low and so have her likes.  Edit- idk why people are downvoting me. She’s got over 100k followers on TT and her posts are getting less than 100 likes. Seeing as she’s not a sex worker and doesn’t post risqué content, it’s likely not a shadowban and is probably just to do with her not using a targeted strategy and therefore not creating engaging content.   Also as an autistic woman myself I sympathize because I have a hard time coming up with authentic and engaging content and gauging trends quickly so that could be a factor.
That’s what I’m thinking 😅
She already has a fully-furnished apartment which she's shown on social media. You do not need extra seating if you're struggling to pay your rent. Most of us are just fine sitting on our couches, which she has.   It's bizarre how people criticize influencers for over-consumption and privilege but when Demi is paying $5k a month for a spacious apartment in LA while not working and complaining about it people are jerks for critiquing that.
Hi! Interested in learning about the company you worked for as I’d love to utilize a company who does work like that for myself
You should DM her this information if you can. Anything can help her right now. I don’t think the people around her care.
She’s from a town near me. Her mom and family battled with incarceration and other issues, so being away from them was actually beneficial for her. She needs a strong support system (don’t we all) but it’s not something that can be willed. She likely feels like LA offers her the best situation but there are more options for her out there. Just returning home isn’t always the best advice for people. Those who “escape” here often do for a reason
or bekah for example - agree with her content or not, she has found a niche which is what keeps her influencing career going (motherhood, sustainability, etc.)! correct me if i’m wrong but i don’t think demi has found that niche, and without standing out you can’t really be successful as an influencer these days
Same
omg "not really a numbers person" always gets me like as a teacher: we all have to be numbers people to some degree! it absolutely kills me when other (female usually) teachers will say shit like that or will say IN FRONT of the kids "oh math just isn't my thing" like... what are you doing?! nOOO!!!
I don't think they've spoken for years. Hannah also just moved to Nashville with her boyfriend.
Oh man.. that’s really rough 😓
there was one guy whose title was “former child” the entire show. and marcus from year ago was listed as a being in sports médecine. he worked front desk at his parents sports médecine clinic in dallas 💀
I don't think I said anything to suggest that autism isn't a spectrum or made any sweeping statements like you're suggesting. With autism being a spectrum, people shouldn't assume that she is capable or incapable of certain things (and I didn't do that -- I was trying to say it's wrong to assume that she can go wait tables for cash, or easily apply for jobs. That isn't the same thing as saying I know for a fact that she is incapable of those things. None of us know. None of us should assume. Saying she should go wait tables is assuming.)   And working before means nothing -- circumstances change. I think she's spoken about relying on unhealthy coping mechanisms (alcohol, masking) in the past, and it is absolutely possible she can't do the things she did before without them.  I also don't think it's condescending to say a woman with autism who is pleading for help might need some form of support she isn't getting. I think it's listening.
I said this in another comment, but my recollection is she's been open about relying on unhealthy coping mechanisms pre-diagnosis. Seems quite possible she knows more about what she is capable of at this point than we do.
I used to work for a non-profit that worked in conjunction with job recruiting services who recruited people with  intellectual/developmental disabilities, and they were able to help them find jobs with livable wages.  One of the administrative managers of the entire non-profit had a neuro developmental disorder as well. They also help them graduate whatever degree they want to pursue. There’s resources out there, people just need to be aware of them and have access to them. There’s even some job recruiting websites that ask if you have some sort of disability to help you with your job search process and cater jobs that best suit your skills. There def needs to be a better access to these and more awareness, I agree!
Agree for sure! I just still feel for anyone going through a shit time. Life can be super fucking easy then get super hard out of nowhere, even if from the outside looking in that wall is predicable.
Yeah, she posted awhile ago that she was losing followers. Influencing doesn't seem like it would be a good long-term career choice for anyone. I've always liked Demi though so I hope she can pivot into a new career.
Just browsed through her page and for 330k followers her views are definitely very low and her engagement is low too. I don’t think she’s found her true niche. TikTok is all about creating niche content. You can’t be all over the place like instagram. I think her content is not very consistent. Her best performing Tiktoks are about autism. Maybe that’s what she should focus on.  She does look all over the place though. I got uncomfy watching some of her stuff.
She should get on tik tok if she’s asking stuff like this, I think she could find a much more understanding audience
Yeah what kind of chair, $150 sounds like a really good deal where I’m at
Sure let me DM you :)
That was well said
I remember her being really close with Hannah G, Heather, and Katie on the show (shoutout HHHDK), but it seems like after a while Heather became closer with Hannah B, Hannah G moved to San Diego with Dylan, and Katie moved to London with her bf, so Demi didn't have them around anymore. She and Katie used to be super close too. It's sad that they're not able to support her right now.
My brother got his job out of college through a place like this. He’s been with Chase bank for 5 years now! Those programs and resources are so great.
Also interested in this info
I'm also curious about this!
Yes they are amazing! Maybe we can send these resources and programs to Demi, and see if she’s even willing to consider them.
Sure do! :)
Hi! Could you send me the info as well? :)
If you have time, could you paste it to me as well? Thank you 😊
It’s a Michael Kors/Dillard’s sponsored post.  https://preview.redd.it/itmqok4cvlsa1.png?width=1124&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a9a8b640f7f725ef38ab8f56a32193e54177fc2f
She looks like an angel on earth
The forever 21 to Zara transition phase.
She’s moved on from Limited Too to today’s Abercrombie
My guess is that it’s because she’s engaged. So she’s going to transition to more “wifey” kinda looks. That feels like a southern gal kinda thing.
I think her hair is darker
She kind of looks like Jenna Dewan in that first pic. Is that just me?
It was for a Michael Kors photoshoot.
![gif](giphy|Lr4WpMbw6O9JLYGBaF|downsized)
ur definitely right it’s different! but it suits her ♥️
I think shes just getting older and her style is organically maturing accordingly.
I actually love her style, I find it more relatable/attainable than a lot of influencers. I noticed she wears a lot of Abercrombie so it's not just designer brands! She wore this white crochet halter top a month ago and I was obsessed.
She’s a wag now, no?
I think this all looks so good for her! I wonder if maybe Miami being such a diff vibe than Cali has played a role as well
On her season, I always thought she looked like a weird mishmosh between a grownup 12 year and a 12 year old. Kind of like Sarah Hyland ca Modern Family. Not to say she’s not hot.
Why did I think that was Jessica Biel?  ![gif](giphy|9GIgLZDjGzz78eaelk)
I think it’s just super photoshopped? She looks unrecognizable in the 2nd photo
She kind of looks like Jessica biel in the first pic
I saw this post earlier and she looks SO good. I think her hair is a little darker too. She can genuinely pull off anything
Okay, so it might be objectively “better”, but I don’t like it. On someone else? Sure. It’s just so not Angel on Earth.
Following
 Maybe a little more cheekbone action.
🥱
This checks out 👍
Nail on the head
That’s exactly what I wanted to type but I couldn’t find the right store to think of! You nailed it!!
I definitely see it!!
It was def unique than the usual BN influencer style. Though I do think she needs to eventually move past that.
I actually thought her girly girl style would’ve matched Miami more than Cali. But since moving away from Cali, her style is starting to improve and mature more.
Haha this outfit lives rent free in my brain 💀  https://preview.redd.it/xag7num55msa1.jpeg?width=680&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7113e11acb6bc0dbf38675e57760af50abd91080
Just a question, why does she need to change her fashion sense? To suit you? Or others? Genuinely curious
What was this from?
From Peter’s Revolve fashion show group date
Group date on Peter’s season!
People saying Tayshia and I'm so confused......like I like her don't get me wrong, but her voice is kind of annoying tbh
It’s gotta be Sharleen
Voice is Shawn Booth. I know I know. Voice alone though.
For those saying Rachel Lindsay I highly recommend listening to her audiobook. She narrates the whole thing and it was a delight to listen to! I didn’t even watch her season but I loved it.   Random but I really like Kendall Long’s voice, too.
Most attractive speaking voice: Rachel Lindsay  Most attractive laugh: Tyler Cameron (sounds like Zac Efron to me)  Most attractive podcast voice: Sharleen Joynt (I just started listening to her recently and I gotta say, she has a great voice)  Honorable Mentions: Jason Tartick, Matt James, Caelynn, Rachel R, Ben Higgins, Jared Haibon, Zach Shallcross, John Paul Jones, Michelle Young, and Peter Weber (the enthusiasm and innocence in his voice remind me of my college boyfriend)  Edited for last names
Bachelor elder here to say Brad Womack.
I wasn’t a huge huge fan on hers but Brit from Chris soules season
Evan Ambrose as Zach Shallcrank for voice. Farmer Chris for best laugh idk if most attractive lol.  And most attractive podcast voice to…Michael Bárbaro? My sorries to any BN podcasters.
Sharleen and Caelynn have the best voices by far
I think Mari has a really sweet and calming voice! Also Rachel Recchia’s  whisper voice had such a hold over me!
caelynn has the most soothing voice everrrrrrrr
Shawn has the most attractive voice
My troll answer is Grocery Store Joe
Bri springs 😍😍😍
Speaking: Rachel Lindsay  Laugh??  Podcast: Jacqueline Trumbull
Caelynn!!!
It’s probably recency bias but… Arielle anyone???
Going with Jason Tartick.
Olivia Caridi has a great podcasting voice and Sydney Lotuaco’s voice is very calming
Peter K has a hot voice
Kate, obviously.  This sub:  ![gif](giphy|1RzxeL2PuHYD1pw32i)
Attractive voice - Brittany’s deep husky voice or Bri Springs. For men?- don’t like him but Peter K lol. Man is hot okayyy.   Attractive laugh- Idk what it is, but I adore Rachel Recchia’s laugh. Her little giggle / loud laugh is so cute. I thought that since Clayton’s season.   Attractive Podcast voice- I don’t listen to a lot of BN podcasts but I would agree w ppl here Rachel Lindsay.
Chad Johnson
Zach has a good deep voice.
Bri Springs, Ariel Frenkel, Shawn Booth, Danielle Lombard (I know her voice was kinda ditsy lol but I thought it was pretty).
Becca Martinez
Zach has a very calm, reassuring voice. I’d want him to be the person that tells me I have a serious illness.  Tayshia has the most attractive speaking voice, might also be that she speaks clearly. Her words aren’t rushed.   Hannah B and Caelynn for best podcast voice.
Tayshia
[removed]
Her voice gives kourtney kardashian
*it’s like alottt*
Her voice is the main reason I never warmed up to her. It sounds artificial to me.
The way she pronounces "Today" is enough reason to never give her a regular TV hosting slot 🤣.
Oh my god I forgot about her, she has such a beautiful voice.
Absolutely 🥵
Omg forgot about his voice. Yes
id fold immediately
I'm seeing this answer a lot I need to go rewatch interviews bc I dont remember offhand
i love listening to higher learning for lots of reasons but rachel’s voice is part of it! it conveys her energy well, if that makes sense.
Last year I was bartending at a hotel and had my back turned away from the bar while entering some receipts, suddenly someone greeted me to order a drink and I stopped dead in my tracks because I knew that voice. It was Jason tartick. I nearly passed out. He has such a distinct and lovely voice lol
Jared's seems so distinct..like it's kinda high pitch or something?
I was listening to the shandy pod today and Andy was saying something like he knew they would be a good fit because of her voice... her voice is great I agree
Only right answer
I second Sharleen!  Best voice and laugh.
I would probably agree with this if I only heard him speaking, but not knowing who it was. His voice is super attractive but I truly loathe the man.
Or Nick Vrrrrrrrrrriall
The only right answer
Oh no ...it seems so flat to me! I can't stay focused when she talks lol
I agree with Jason re: podcasting - he's really engaging to listen to, and he is an excellent communicator with his guests.
Yes, I second Sydney. She has such a calming presence about her in general, but her speaking voice is beautiful too!
I agree about sydney
💀💀💀
Rewatching bip8 and omg i agree
F#CK YOU CHRIS HARRISON
Oooh I forgot about Bri because, recency, but she does have a beautiful speaking voice, plus I think she's one of the most beautiful girls to ever appear on the franchise, but I know that wasn't the question 🤣  Ariel has a very calming voice - I think that's why many people interpret her as being boring, but I think it's just because she doesn't raise her voice or get heated the way many women on the show do.
I so badly want to agree with Tayshia but it’s very valley girl to me. I don’t love it. But, I love Tayshia
Lol Tayshia’s voice is the only thing unattractive about her for me.
I completely disagree about Tayshia....
That’s a good point about tayshia. Except she makes these unusual inflections in the middle of her sentences
Ooh I felt the opposite of Zach - I always thought like he sounded as if he had a bubble stuck in his throat!   Tayshia, I agree is well spoken, but as someone else mentioned, waaaaay too Kourney Kardashian for me.
“this is… a looooot”  ![gif](giphy|DPFfmFkyYp4Ra4Y3e6|downsized)
Is this a joke lol
Oh lord yes!!
I love Jason's voice, and Jason, in general. He seems like a truly quality human being.   Seeing his relationship with Kaitlyn compared to when she was with Shawn... Jason is so fucking supportive and just wants her to shine.   He's also super engaging on his podcast, and actually listens to his guests, rather than speaking over them or waiting for them to finish and continue on with what \*he\* wanted to say.
Good god no!!
He was ahead of this time
Omg yes I could never get over this 😭 made me so uncomfy for no reason 😂  'welCCOOme guys let's all siIIIIIIit dowWWWWn'
No, lol. It’s the accent.
Aw.. why did you delete? I thought Hannah’s voice on her season was very soothing. It’s when she reads off a script is when it becomes difficult to listen to.
I was at like -3. Just didn’t want to deal with negative comments
Yep, last week I rented a yacht and took my husband to a private island in Thailand for some horseback riding and a picnic. This week we’re taking it easy & just going to a spa in Estonia. 😄
When traveling, I like to ask every old couple I see on the street how long they’ve been together and whether they have advice for me.
Husband and I did Clayton and Susie’s FS date while in Iceland (the spa part, not the spiraling fight). It was very nice and romantic and we probably wouldn’t have gone if I hadn’t seen it on the show  =]
Yes, I once dated 40 women at once but when I invited all of them to a stranger's mansion to hand out flowers to the ones I liked most, they weren't into it at all.
I got COVID a few times and gave it to my husband.
I mean I joke about whether or not I’d give my husband a date rose whenever we get a date night lmao just us, 11 years in, at a restaurant table and I’m like, “I’m feeling really confident about where this is going”
I wanna know what the people who said yes took from the show
You mean you guys don't bring roses to award at dinner?
My boyfriend is a pilot. I regularly, and I mean *regularly* ask him to take me somewhere in a mini airplane. It hasn’t happened yet, but this is a dream that I will not let die.
Maybe some inspiration for vacation spots lol. That’s about it.
I always loved the helicopter tours so I booked one for a fboi. I enjoyed it nonetheless m, he didn’t deserve it lol.
Yes! Of course. There is no love that is more genuine and *real* than The Bachelor.
A few years ago my now-husband took me on a surprise date to iFly. He joked that if we were on the Bachelor the narrative would either be "their love was in freefall" (if the date went poorly) or "they soared to new heights together" (if it went well).
Nah but I have spotter red flags because of the show 🚩
When i broke up with my boyfriend at his place last year i still didn’t want to walk back to my car alone so i was like “will you walk me out?” 😂😂 felt very much like a walk to a limo exit lol
No I’ve never taken romantic inspiration from the show but I do love to see all the gorgeous places the show does and I’ll add them to my bucket list
Glad to know we are all normal realists and it’s not that our lives and relationships aren’t romantic.
I told my friend to use the “Can I steal you for a second?” Or a variation of that with a girl.  But they’ve never used it. Idk about you but if I were in a group conversation making googly eyes at someone and they pulled me aside to talk I’d love it.
I said yes because watching Rachel Lindsay be so confident and true to herself really helped me get back into dating after a bad breakup from a long term relationship. Queen Rach will always be my favorite bachelorette! 👑
sometimes during the show I would text my fwb and go hook up with him after, does that count? 😂 it’s bleak out here
There is currently a four year old sleeping in between my husband and I in my fantasy suite.
Don't forget what you must do next in Estonia   https://preview.redd.it/9kqvwn9jiksa1.png?width=530&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b5bab31f7d6213525d5994d0686681d2d846d88d
Calling NASA to rent one of those anti gravity machines when I get the chance
Omg same
That’s so romantic! I’m such a sap for romance and that sounds like a dream!!
What a fun way to connect with strangers! I love this!
I can’t tell if this is sarcastic or serious lol
They should be a bit more open minded… sounds fun
Lol that’s so cute!
Vacation spots/activities. Even if they’re going somewhere dumb like Cleveland or Virginia, usually there’s a place there you can say, “yeah, I’d check that out.” I am a travel hound and I fall for that paid marketing like a sucker.  Edit: except Nemacolin- that hotel is a rip off owned by republicans that’ll never get my money
My husband is a recreational pilot and I actually never go on excursions with him. I’m afraid we’ll crash & our kids will become orphans.
My boyfriend and I are always scouting out places lol
Oh yes, of course, right after we converse for an hour with a naked couple. We’ll then head to the national wife carrying race because there’s nothing more romantic than being carried around like this in high-heeled boots and white pants in Estonia! Can’t wait!!
LOL. I’m an incredibly shy person. I cringe even thinking about doing it for real.
Does he have a lot of hours? Mine is an airline pilot, so he’s got thousands of hours, which helps ease any fears. I was also an FA and flew on his planes a few times, but I specifically want a little, private 2 seater plane. Accidents do happen though, so I can understand your fear, especially when considering children!
![gif](giphy|TUtr2Ky56D4Zy)
He has a private pilot license, and usually only flies 4-seater Cessnas - just for fun. He flies regularly, but I’m still nervous. He does fly the kids & friends to fun places tho! I guess we have a better chance of dying in a car crash, but I just can’t go up in a plane with him not as long as we still have young kiddos.
is it just me or are they looking like they just had a devils lettuce appetizer lmao
Every bone in my body wants to call them cringe but I have to stop myself and just let these kids have fun lol I’m working on myself ok
 Justin always cracks me up
Rodney looks sooooo good looking with a beard
Lol I thought it was fun and harmless. Just some friends having fun!
Where is this clip from?!?! Somebody tell grandma right now!!
Well, I enjoyed it
Justin Glaze just does things to me, and half of it is his sense of humor and comedic delivery I can’t help it 😫
All fine men!
I watch these videos for Justin 🤣
Justin honestly saves this group
People like to hate on them but I find them genuinely hilarious
Why is everyone so uptight? FFS, life is short, laugh a little. We are in our 40's, our friend group does stupid shit like this and laugh our asses off. My husband is certainly not a fuck boi, we have real jobs and 5 kids. You are taking life way too serious.
They all kinda look blazed too which makes this even more endearing to me. 😆🙃
I think it's great that these guys all found such strong friendships.
God forbid they act silly and have fun 🙄 This realistically took a max ten minutes out of their two hour dinner to film. None of the tables around them look like they were being disturbed. They didn’t force their server to play along. Men goofing around in a quick TikTok doesn’t make them fuck boy clout chasers. I don’t think the video particularly funny but Jesus just let them have fun
Ugh I love Justin 🥵
I have a confession… I’m a 36 year old male and I don’t get TikTok
RHOBH represent!
Genuinely laughed at this and needed it. thank you for sharing. :D
they all better come back to paradise, idc if they are players! those are my friends!
Justin….I wanted to see him as the Bachelor sooooo badly!  😍
Idc I love these men and think they are hilarious
is it my jam? no. but it's harmless fun?  some of you aren't subtle w the standard you hold the handful of semi popular black men to. we all know if grippo or tyler c or pilot pete or blakeson or ben s did this the responses would be majority "DADDY" & "i would let him ruin my life"
This was funny.
Cue the people with no sense of humor who “don’t get TikTok” who have to announce their opinion on everything like a boomer Karen. Scroll past, people, you do realize that’s an option too, right?
Why do y’all post every single tik tik these guys do in here?
Rodney looks better with a goatee, Andrew should take notes and grow a beard.
They always look like they are having way too much fun
Nick is always working. He was there trying to get tea on Justin’s cousin who is on love is blind lol
This is so cute
Not every single TikTok that someone does needs to be posted here…
![gif](giphy|Jvltv3CBE0deMj5s3F|downsized)
Can you guys just download tiktok and stop reposting them on IG and reddit
Rodney looks so good with this facial hair!
Step 1: Move to LA  Step 2: Make tik Toks  Step 3: High five bro!
Some of the comments here sound strangely bitter. Did one of them break up with you??! 😆 When attractive White guys do TikToks everyone is all heart eyes, but with attractive Black men there’s so much negativity!
is this their job now? Being hanger ons with Nick and making Tik toks?
They should do a quadruple Bachelor season with the four of them lol
I saw Nick was hanging out with them too.
It kills me that people actually eat this shit up
I just can’t imagine filming stuff like at this at a restaurant. It’s so embarrassing.
Ahhhh all the fuck boys together..
This gives me major ick 😵‍💫
Y tho. These tiktoks are pointless
I just hope they left a really good tip for their server. At least 30%. It would be so annoying as a server to miss out on another table because a group is taking extra time making TikToks.
That’s my appetizer to every (evening) meal 😍
good for them lmao
I'm with you. It's hard when you grow up ain't it?
Real housewives
Real housewives of Beverly Hills!!
![gif](giphy|l9XJordYGtJAbitK8L|downsized)
Thank you, I think these guys seem so fun, and I don’t understand why they get so much hate here. What’s wrong with having fun and making the most out of your opportunities?
This sub really despies this group of black men. Like leave them be
Posted this already but if Greg is getting space here for TikTok, I want to boost this crew too 😇
Right? I thought this was cute and silly 🙈
As someone who doesn’t spend time on tik tok anymore, this sub is my fyp
This kills me hahah! How do I save this gif
Can you just scroll past?
Nah it’s just as cringe when white guys do it lol
Oh please
Well they tried the whole bachelor live stage thing but nobody wanted to show up
They have to get together with other BN people to hold on. A whole new group of men from charity’s season are about to be released
I live in L.A. and it’s common to see people recording on their phones. I mean it’s 2023. Nobody cares.
Shame is a good thing. People should have shame and be shamed lol
I think Leroy is still in Dallas so he’s not a full timer  Andrew is monoracial   The biracial clique is missing brandon
They’re just for fun, who cares
Still a grippo girl but if Greg is getting space here for TikTok’s, I want to boost this crew too 😇
Orrrr... maybe their server enjoyed the fun?
Nah they’re clearly still consuming their drinks/meal they aren’t doing anything to effect their server and you don’t have to rush through your meal just because you’re outside your home. They should tip well because everyone should but they aren’t doing anything to effect that.
makes every meal better!!
I'm 40, a manager with stupid hours,  married with a4 year old. I think it's jealousy mostly bc I WANNA BE SILLY TOO
![gif](giphy|bAjJ1jfbDrgCk|downsized)
The ones with hateful colorists remarks against black women you mean?
I love tiktoks, thats why I have tiktok. A lot of people (usually millennials and older) refuse to download tiktok, and then they just keep watching/enjoying tiktok videos after they're posted on other social media platforms. Just... download tiktok.
Exactly. Some of us rightfully clown all of the behavior   And funny using this excuse for guys with hateful colorist remarks against black women
Maybe I am too old but that life sounds miserable to me lol. And you nailed it! these men are trying to hold on to relevance as much as they can before the new crop of men are released!
I feel bad for the server too! It makes approaching them hard since you don’t want to piss them by interrupting but you need to turn tables quick to make money 😕   these videos aren’t done in one take and they could be there for hours nursing one drink doing videos.
I have tiktok, I just like being able to come to 1 place for content. Having a place to share all SM platforms makes it less time-consuming for everyone.
👆🏻
I clown them but it’s sad to me. Rodney is in his 30s and the others are close. Andrew and Justin look to be living in a hotel suite in LA that they got shortly before the bachelor tour was cancelled. Justin had a real career before the show and a finance gig and NY was right there if he wanted a change. Andrew also left behind that tik tok girl he was dating in NY for this??  Katie is selling feet on only fans and she was a bachelorette. I don’t know what they think they are going to do
And they probably did more than one tik tok the way they roll
There is no one place lol. Reddit stuff gets posted elsewhere.
Probably. It’s weird this is becoming normal behavior in public spaces, especially gyms.
The bar for “slaying” is on the floor now 🤪
How is this slaying? Did I miss something
Even though he’s not for me, I will say he is damn good at these lol
Can’t stand these two
I can’t believe I’m saying this…they are growing on me.
This is great 👍
a big part of TikTok is just lip-syncing pop culture moments or audio clips, and believe me, half the time people do a shit job, don't even line up the audio with their lips, or even make it remotely funny. Greg is good at it, that's it.
Humor. Your missing humor.
He’s pretty good at lip syncing. VF is way off
Think my opinion starting turning around when they cut off Nick and Natalie.
Well, you’re missing an “e” and you don’t see anybody mentioning that…except me right now!  Btw, are the speakers the kardashians? It’s aggravating my soul so I assume it’s them.
They what?? Spill. ☕️
They cut off Nick and Natalie??!!!
Haha right?!
Lol yes the kardashians
there probably isn't actually any drama between them specifically but right after Nick and Natalie got engaged she went to Paris with two of her (former) friends, they both unfollowed Natalie after the trip and VF has been interacting on SM more with the former friends than Natalies, this was in January.
Right!? Spill!
Me:  ![gif](giphy|Zx12n2W9mDpNS)
Idk in my opinion “slay” may be an overstatement here lol
Meryl Streep really can act!!
I’m more impressed with how VF seems to be the queen of the casual-off-the-shoulder look that I tried so hard to pull off in high school. I’m envious.
Greatest actor of y’all generation
Lipsync content is the worst
Lol I get it haha. Big decisions-easy. What to eat? Nearly impossible. I have no explanation.
I don't get this at all??? Lol I'm not a TT person I guess
Tbh, I’m mostly surprised that these two are still together. I didn’t not think they would make it this long!
Slay? I feel like I'm getting baited with these titles lately.
I love them together. There. I said it.
Lol both have been displaying some good acting since they first hit our screens on the bachelor. If they are happy together, I’m happy for them👏
As a libra , I feel this deeply 😂😭
i am once again begging these gorgeous women to stop pumping their faces full of fillers.  i mean if it makes you feel more beautiful… sure? but it just seems like the filler era keeps pushing the line of what’s “beautiful” further and further to where the end goal becomes more and more unattainable.
Her lip syncing is so off 😭
Yetta is such an iconic character
Bach people do simple voice over meme tiktoks and people post them here like they just saw bridesmaids for the first time
Right? I had to watch it twice to see if I missed something 😆 or maybe I’m just old 👵🏻
![gif](giphy|l3q2yGS9YLGsXbT1e|downsized)
![gif](giphy|BImopIi4wUmeCdQ9DK|downsized)
Maybe it’s because I’ve been to too many drag shows with phenomenal lip syncs but most of the lip sync content is just so off sync I can’t watch.
Came here to say the same thing.  Not excusing any previous behavior but they just seem to work and I love it.
We have you surrounded! Come out with your hands up!
Me too. I’m feeling it
Same! Indecisive gang. My husband gets so annoyed.
Greg slays every time, no comment on Victoria  ![gif](giphy|j2XSDcTwSWqB0mzDSH|downsized)
Her storyline with Ray Charles >
That whole show was, and the insane fashion, what I would give to own those outfits 😩
Lmao I know that’s right
Nah it’s off season and this is a sub about the franchise so OP is providing us with content. Give us something better then ◡̈.
Lmaoooo mine tooooo 😂
Totally, I’m just ragging on OP for saying this was “slaying” lol
I hear you, I'm just grateful we have something to talk about, and imo he is good at these tiktoks!
Why not jump ship to another reality tv board—things are fun over on LIB!
My Bach pods are recapping the new season so I def. need to start it!!
The parents tea/open house/funeral is tomorrow and I have so much damn anxiety cause like it or not everyone loved them and know there is at least going to be 200+ people there tomorrow
Wow a big ass tree fell down on the course at the masters! Luckily no one got hurt I don't think.  Happy Easter and Passover everyone.
I’m sorry you’re going through all this pain. I’m sure it’ll be overwhelming, but I hope you can find some degree of comfort in the love and respect your parents will receive. Seems like they made a real impact on others.
On an side note, for anyone in alberta, we need to rehome 5 cats. Dm if interested
So sorry to read about your recent series of events 💔sending positivity to you and hope you sort everything out with the animals and all.
I would definitely bring it up by using “I” statements. Instead of saying they’re complaining too much you could say that “I notice that when we hang out I feel drained by your negativity” and focus on specific examples. Of course tell them that if they want to talk you’re there to support them about more serious issues.   That sounds emotionally draining and it would be tough but necessary to bring up, and I think you are a great friend by bringing it to their attention rather than just ignoring it.  Edit a word
Hell even my dad's plumber cried for over an hour on the phone with my brother in law.
Anyone who ever met them immediately fell in love with them. They were just that kind of people.
Thankyou friend❤❤
Justice for the Tennessee Three. It is so fucked what’s happening.
It’s truly mentally draining waking up every day and feeling outraged by something new. It’s a constant attack and I don’t know how we stop them when they can do shit like this. It seems so hopeless.
the overt racism is WILD
Per RS: Something happened this season that we haven’t seen before, fairly major, expects to figure out particulars over the weekend and report it on Monday  I wonder if this explains why we’ve seen fewer men in the pics so far  Edit: Also random, RS says he typically goes to bed at 1am and wakes up around 6:30am. Couldn’t be me - I need 7 hours minimum!
Xavier looks so hot here 😭😭🥵🥵  https://preview.redd.it/xhoj0scydjsa1.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=870c9cb8fb54aaf093ca5904c5d8a9bc60853248
Is it confirmed that those 6 in the picture are the only 6 guys remaining? I just find it really hard to believe she cut all those guys.
Where is everyone getting that there's only 6 guys left? I'm not seeing a post on this.
How is there only 6 guys left pls?? Didn’t they start filming 2 days ago 😭😭
What if they’re a total of 12 guys left and they decided to split the guys into two groups for weeks 5/6. Week 5 is one group of 6 and week 6 is another group. That way each of the men get more time with the lead.
Let's hope we get pics the next 2 days bc that will help confirm our suspicions.
There’s no way there are 6 guys left at week 5. We’re only halfway into filming and they need material to fill a certain amount of episodes.   They definitely have split the guys up. The real question is why…   I wonder if there’s a lot of drama between the boys this season and they needed to be separated to avoid altercation. Or maybe they’re just trying to do something different and give Charity more time to focus on specific men.
If Charity only has those 6 men remaining then I’m inclined to think:  F1- Joey (in the recent video on @bachelorwhatever’s story if you zoom in a little you can see them kiss twice in front of the other men after entering the carriage and their arms are clearly intertwined between them. They looked very happy to me! I could also take the producer fed kissing story and favorable treatment to be them knowing Charity wants him and trying to make the F1 look good)  F2- Xavier (reallyyyyy need to see video footage of him and Charity interacting though 😩, I have nothing but his good looks to go off of here)  F3- Tanner (also desperately need video of him interacting with her…something about Jojo and Jordan having to persuade him to kiss Charity at the barbie date gave me pause putting him in the final two. It also made me think he hadn’t kissed her yet up until that point. Maybe he’s a slower burn. His look also gives me “typical bachelor lead prototype” especially down to his hair and physique. I think ABC will have him in the running for bachelor despite fans’ loud cries for a MOC cause they never listen)  F4- Aaron B (I don’t want to watch Aaron Clancy’s San Diego bros anymore but I fear the producers like him enough to give him a hometown and a paradise ticket)  F5/F6 - Dotun and Sean (I wouldn’t be surprised if I had to switch one of them out for a top 4 spot because I haven’t seen Charity interact with anyone of these 6 except Joey 😭).  Dying to see Charity’s demeanor with the other men to see how it affects my rankings. But for now, I feel good keeping Joey at F1 like my initial prediction.
Idk if I believe the 6 men left thing - how do you go from 14/13 to 6? That’s crazy. What if they just aren’t pictured in that shot in NOLA?
So wen they had the Hollywood sign group date, Aaron won and got one on one time with her, then the kissing group date Joey won and got one on one time. The barbie group date Sean won and saw got to go spend some time with her but dont kno if he got even more time like the other two. Maybe there are no group date after parties this season, and theyve changed the format of the show somehow. Or maybe one less episode? And this is before honetowns
I'm not sure whether to believe the 6 men are left already theory or not but if it's the case I hope all of them who got eliminated at once get the chance to be on BIP.
Well IF this really is Charity’s F6 guys htds must be super soon. Going to guess (since we don’t have much to go off of and have only seen her with two of the guys) Xavier, Joey, Tanner and Aaron B will be her F4. Wonder if her FIR is even still around.
There is no way there is only 6 men left and production is ok with it. Yeah it would be good for the actual romance aspect but it pretty much guarantees low drama. If true I think her season may unfortunately be cut short tbh
I get that the purpose of this Sub/this thread is to speculate but some of y'all are going into tailspins over next to no information. I think it's best to use Occam's razor. It's less likely that there are only 6 guys left when it's barely been two weeks of filming. It's also unlikely that we aren't going to get any international travel to "cut costs." A lot of travel is comped and ABC could find other ways to reduce budgets besides possibly jeopardizing people's interest.   I don't know how some people have made it so high on some of y'alls rankings when we haven't seen a single photo/image of them and don't even know if they're still there lols.  My guess is whoever turns out to be FIR and F1 are going to be 1) two different people, 2) Charity is probably playing who she is really into closer to the vest than we may assume, and 3) the F1 will probably be a surprise to us based on what little we've been spoiled but won't be a surprise when the show actually airs.  I'm just hoping for love and drama because multiple people fall for the lead and less producer silliness (i.e. no past contestants showing up, toxic exes, racist storylines, etc.). We shall see.
Man it would have had really helped if we saw pictures of todays group date🙃
Tbh it seems like the 6 guys we’ve seen in NOLA are the front runners we’ve been seeing the last couple of weeks. I feel like it’s unlikely they split the men into groups because why would they put all the front runners in one group? Starting to think there are really only 6 remaining
If weee down to 6 men this means to me that the szn will end right before Labor Day and BiP will pick up right after.
Has anyone found dotuns Instagram or any info about him
I think Charity is going to have a short season.. no international travel but maybe for F2
if i'm doing the math correctly and this is in fact Week 5, the Barbie date will air the same week of the Barbie movie premiere. that seems like some pretty smart publicity although i'm kind of shocked the current state of the show was able to nab sponsorship with a film as big as Barbie. might just tell myself that this related to fleiss leaving and be excited for the future!
What if a few of the guys left got COVID and have to be isolated for some days? Cause I thought it was weird how both times that happened it was only one person and the rest didn't catch it
Assuming they are gone now, but any idea how far Caleb A and Kaleb Kim made it?
Maybe it’s just me but I also think that whatever RS is talking about has to do with FIR? Maybe she actually didn’t kiss her FIR.
If Charity is really already down to 6 guys then my prediction is:  F1 - Tanner   F2 - Xavier  F3 - Joey (and next Bachelor)  F4 - Sean (and straight to BIP like Marcus/Jared/Dean/Johnny)
Ohhhh shit I read your first sentence and immediately attributed it to the number of men left 😭. If pics of the same exact guys come out today then i think Charity might have cleaned house and sent like 6 men packing. The upside would be her getting to spend more time with the remaining guys and the audience getting to know them better.  Hopefully RS has the reasoning behind whatever took place too.
That would definitely be wild if by episode five she only has six guys left!  Bc when leads meet up with all their guys at the beginning of episodes they’re usually all there and the group isn’t that small.   Maybe she’s sent most guys packing on their one on ones so far or last rose ceremony cut most of them.
He said today should be a group date so hopefully we’ll get pics. If it’s the same guys again, we’ll know something happened >Edit: Also random, RS says he typically goes to bed at 1am and wakes up around 6:30am.  He always looks so tired he should get more rest lol😭
I feel like this could explain why instead of 10-12 men remaining, there’s actually 6 men remaining and she took Joey for 1-on-1 from that group of men. It reminds me of Peter grabbing Hannah Ann or Gabby grabbing Nate, or Arie grabbing Lauren, etc. from group of contestants remaining.  So you saying she wouldn’t let producers keep certain men around for drama or more exposure?
RS has also said he sometimes goes back to sleep for a couple hours after letting his dog outside.   My life feels so sad when I realize how much I know about this man’s schedule from listening to his podcasts everyday. Haha
If the guys are narrowed down to 6 already, what if no gets eliminated until the end ep 7 and everybody gets a 1-on-1, two individual dates per ep (obvi) which meansneverybody left will get one, no one gets a rose cause it doesn't matter, but you can still get a group date rose for extra time.  Then at the end of ep 7 she elimates 2 guys and has her hometowns.
I feel like charity must have eliminated a whole group at an after party of a group date lol
That’s really bad for your brain to routinely get that little of sleep
Xavier's one of my top picks...soo happy he's still there! 🥰
He’s starting to become my new favorite based on looks and the fact that he seems like such an underdog so far 🫶
Oh hello there 🥵
OOOF🤤🤤🤤
People think that’s what Reality Steve is referring to in terms of “something major happened this season that we’ve never seen before ever.”
Yesterday charity was sitting with six guys chatting, then left to go on a one on one with Joey. So it seems it's like other seasons wen the lead meets up with the group then tells one theyre going on a date. It wouldnt really make sense for her to meet up with half the guys to tell one I'm picking u for a date, so it must be all the guys that are left, in my opinion
Also there are pictures on yesterday's spoiler thread
Yeah this makes sense. And it’s a good idea!  For my fellow bb fans I wonder if it’ll be like split week on bb24. Two one on ones, the group date, and then 2-3 guys eliminated from that group.
Yep
this would make a lot of sense to me actually
lols I can't imagine they are splitting grown adult men into two groups because there's too much potential for altercation. This is a reality show after all. They'd want the altercation and tension. It would be great for ratings.  But I do agree with you that it's unlikely that there are only 6 guys left. Just wouldn't make sense.
Xavier’s degree and likely future career feel well-matched with Charity. They both seem driven in the science space. Of course, that doesn’t matter if they don’t have chemistry, so I hope we see more soon 😂
I actually zoomed in and I don't think Joey and Charity kissed. I thought they did but when you zoom in it looks like she's doing something to her hair and other things.
I have a sneaking suspicion Joey is a self elim at F3 type (historically my faves do this to me).
What do we think of Sean? I seen some chemistry when they walked off stage arm and arm at the Barbie date.
Yeah I’m confused as well, like what could’ve happened that would eliminate all those guys so fast? Even if she wasn’t feeling them I find it hard to believe she would get rid of them so fast
Yeah I also don’t think it’s true
If they have a resort booked for FSD/FRC, I don’t know that they can really expedite the filming timeline that much. They could do it in Covid bubble seasons since there was no travel, but I don’t see how they could re-schedule travel, rooms, filming locations, etc on this season. They‘d need some serious luck to pull that off.  All that’s to say, if there are really only 6 men left, production might have to stretch out filming for a bit instead of jumping to HTDs. Unless this was in the plans from the beginning when the schedule was created. But what a bizarre plan from production when viewers need to know guys for the next BIP season.
I have a gut feeling the fir is Tanner. Just a feeling 😂
All of this 👏   It’s like when cast pics come out and people automatically jump to “this person should be the bachelor”. Like, why? Bc they’re cute? We know nothing about them! Let’s see how they play out on tv, damn.
At least it’s still better than when people worked themselves up into a frenzy convincing themselves that Katie was taking Mikey P to hometowns because she was a production pet and then they could make him the next virgin Bachelor. That was peak insanity on the spoiler thread.
Are they the frontrunners, or are they the guys who've just happened to be pictured the most? I think the only real frontrunner we can point out in that group is Joey.
Same. Which makes me wonder if it’s gonna be a shorter season. On a realistic level this would be great for Charity picker wise to allow her more time with the guys and to get to know them, but I’m not convinced TPTB will think that makes interesting TV so I could see a shorter season
Yeah it is kinda weird that we haven’t seen photos of other guys by this point. But splitting into two groups doesn’t make sense to me from a logistics standpoint. Like did they send the other guys to the next city with a batch of producers to watch over them? And I think it would make weird tv to split the guys so that one week you see one group and then a week later you see the other group. It could work for a series like Love Is Blind where you can binge the two episodes back to back but a week break would be weird.
This is what I was thinking as well. All of the frontrunners and/or the ones we’ve seen her on 1-on-1 with or had connection with so far are all here (except for Brayden but some of us already could tell that she didn’t really have chemistry with Brayden; heck she even had more chemistry with John B in one clip than her date clips with Brayden).
That would be disappointing 😕
Agreed.  Also the season might end mid august
Or she could have up to 10 episodes with just more quality time with her six men remaining for the last 7 episodes and give it more of a LIB feel 🤞🤞🤞 this is the time to change things up now that Fleiss is gone.
The Barbie movie and the Bachelorette are both distributed by Warner Bros. So it’s not a sponsorship as much as Warner Bros telling the production team “guess what…you’re promoting Barbie the week the movie premieres”.
I remember they used to do Disney movies, Emily and her guys watched brave, Desiree and Juan pablo watched the lone ranger
The bachelor(ette) may have declined in recent years but it’s still ABCs highest rated show (besides sometimes greys but even that’s declining) plus it gets a lot of attention on SM. I see why Barbie production would be interested in partnering with the show.
I think RS said it has nothing to do with COVID, on his latest pod episode
Caleb A was on the Barbie group date so at least week 3.  Kaleb was probably a night 1 elim, wouldn’t be surprised if there was a storyline about them already knowing each other because he also went to Auburn and was on the football team at the same time as her ex.
6 guys? That seems soo fast!
I hope next bachelor will be a MoC. There’s still alot of episodes left regardless if there’s 6 men remaining; whos to say they won’t consider 3 other monoracial black men left Dotun, Xavier, or Aaron B? Unless they make us extremely happy, and pull a Katie/Clayton move for an Asian man…therefore, pull Warwick out of the grapevine and make him Next Bachelor! 🤞  Now that Mike Fleiss and Chris Harrison and some prominent OG producers are out, what’s stopping them from making this happen? It doesn’t hurt to try 🤷🏻‍♀️  Edit: Eww for ppl downvoting that “I hope” next bachelor is a MoC.
It would be so weird because she had *at least* 14 left in week 3! I can't imagine production would let her then cut 8 guys over the next 2 rose ceremonies? It really limits them if there are so few guys left only halfway through the season.
They said budget cuts
Ok I know this because I listen to his daily roundup-he gets up, feeds the dog and takes her out, releases the podcasts, and takes a 2-3 hour nap haha
Oh that makes sense haha. Tbh I fast forward his daily podcast in 15 second increments and only listen to spoiler talk.
he has such a kind smile!
Ugh. I just wish he would tell us! That would mean John Henry was eliminated :(
Yes I agree! I’m so curious to see how she is around him and if RS’s news ends up being that only 6 remain, I’m excited for her to have more time with them individually and for the final 6 to have more focused screen time which leads to more substantial storylines (and more high stakes breakups since they will get to know her better prior to leaving).
Bachelor candidate to me if he’s not chosen
I think they kissed at least once if not twice especially because of how Joey turned and leaned in and how his hand started to move up to her face right before the carriage pulls away. But we will just have to see when the episode airs 😏.
My faves tend to do that as well 😭. I just want to be right for once so I’m manifesting it. If we get evidence he might waver then I will go back to the drawing board 🥲.
I’m not gonna lie, with the looming possibility that these are the last remaining men, i think Sean could surprise us all.
It's like a COVID loom that some men from Charity's season having tested positive from the disease. I guess they are in isolation.
Yeah I’m guessing it’s him or Xavier if FIR is still there
I think the assumption is they are the front runners based on Joey, Aaron B and Sean all having 1 on 1 time with her after winning early dates. And the people who were in attendance of dates made it seem like her and Tanner vibed as well on the Barbie date. Plus we never see the other guys
American Idol is ABC’s highest rate show by a very large margin.
Thx!
I think Joey is getting a big Bachelor set-up, since he had the producer fed story on the kissing date and one of the better costumes on the Barbie date. But that’s just a guess.  And I don’t want to see *anyone* who was eliminated in episode 2 become the lead lmao, Katie and Clayton were bad enough and they both made it to episode 6.
What about Michael?  And they should consider an Asian contestant from this season or previous seasons. I’m in favor of a black monoracial lead too but we have one now with charity and Asian rep is severely lacking
Sorry that you got downvoted fartbox. Some people really suck. 😬🙄 It never hurts to remain cautiously optimistic. Agreed, maybe now that Fleiss, CH, etc. are gone they’ll actually start to make some positive changes in the right direction. We’ll see. Time will tell.
Yeah I’m surprised production would go for this because it’s just going to be so much harder for them to edit the season with so few people. You need a bunch of contestants during these middle episodes to help with storylines and keep things interesting and moving.  Maybe Charity is getting a much shorter season and we’ll have a BIP Premiere in August after all?
If this is true, maybe there will be fewer episodes for this season?
Honestly it might be better for Charity to focus on her core group of men. Remember, Bachelorettes already have their mind made up since night 1 and everyone else they let producers keep for entertainment. I think this is more of a benefit for Charity. It’s going to feel like more like Love is Blind where it really narrows down on the romances. It’s time to switch this up. I’ve noticed so many diff things they are already doing this season with group dates ending with 1-on-1 night portion dates, that’s kinda refreshing IMO.
Haha I love how you always come in with “budget cuts” when your reason is prob the main reason
Oh so he does that in addition to his nightly sleep? That’s definitely better haha
He said he doesn't have all the info and should have it by the weekend and would share it on Monday.
Same here. This is how I feel like for Warwick and John B as well. While this benefits Charity more, it doesn’t benefit certain contestants for getting represented better and possibly becoming Next Bachelor and such.
She never looked straight at him for him to kiss her, and when he brought his hand up, he touched what seemed like his mouth, not her. You can zoom in on insta video posts, just use two fingers like you would on a picture.
I’m completely making up a theory that Xavier is who she *should* pick (established, ready to settle down, lives in similar area of country) and Joey is a hotty from Hawaii who is kind of a wanderlust and their lives are very different. And that’s who she’s torn between and she’ll ultimately wants Joey.
Wow I had no idea people still watched that show … the more you know 😂   But still… bachelor is still one of the most successful.
Well if that’s the case, I hope he is F1 and will manifest it hard if people already think and gearing him up as the Next Bachelor lol. Plus I feel like if Charity is already spoiling him this much with 1-on-1 attention and roses, I usually root for them for F1.   If not F1, he could just be a fan favorite like many others who came before him and hope to see him do well in Paradise 😁
Down to 6 guys left *if true:* Dotun, Aaron, B, and Xavier are the MoC left.
Exactly; they needed to change up the formula anyway, and given how Gabby and Rachel’s season shook out, I think they can see that less time with the guys doesn’t work.  And the last Bachelorette to last with her guy beyond a year was, what, Rachel Lindsay?  They need another lasting couple.  (I know Tayshia and Zac made it to a year but not by much.)
It’s the opposite of when they shoved 45 of us in an English class in high school for the same reason
Yes hahaha and I’m ashamed to know this
Agreed, this is exactly what I saw after screen recording. They were just talking
Okay well even if they didn’t kiss, they do look happier than yesterday’s photo suggested is all I’m saying. They were actually smiling with intertwined hands which the photo didn’t show us.
Okay I can totally see this happening 😭. It’s the classic bachelorette dilemma. Do I use logic and go with my brain or do I follow my spontaneous/whimsical heart.
Historically it was, but this past season was more in line with its other shows. Zach’s finale didn’t even win the 18-49 demo for that night, which is…not great.
What happened to Michael? For some reason, I thought he was mentioned as still there yesterday.
Yea we all thought that as well but there’s good possibility that the major event that happened this season is Charity having only 6 men left on Week 5. Which makes it hard to believe. But the fact that that group date was so confusing as it had Joey in it, and she pulled him from it to give him a full 1-on-1 date. Usually leads do that from a group that’s remaining not from a group date. I don’t think they had a competition for Joey to win a 1-on-1 again?
Well, it is too early for next bachelor but ABC has yet to renew the contract for the 28th season.
I love this new theory!

I am once again asking if anyone knows if Pp and Kelly are still together.
Looks like Eliza and her boyfriend have broken up and Rodney and Eliza have re-followed each other and he liked her most recent photo
I leave you with this on this blessed Friday   https://preview.redd.it/5sbm73443jsa1.png?width=1125&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e65d3fc021848e8ec616081a8d65d0ddf43ddd94

My kingdom for Ariel’s dress collection
I queued up the finale. Husband saw it was three hours: "what the FUCK? that's like a whole lord of the rings movie! What are they up to for THREE hours?"   On kaity's atfr dress: "I don't understand dresses that are short with long sleeves. It seems like the sleeves are for warmth, but then the dress is short so what's the point?"   On charity's season preview: "they're going to bring out her brother, because if you remember, he's super important to her" (I did not remember)...dude absorbs more of these episodes than I do!
Do we know where Charity leans politically?
I also suffer from this condition
It’s ✨BIOLOGY✨😂
I was missing my long distance boyfriend yesterday so I was looking through old photos. I saw one where he was wearing a backwards hat and it reminded me why I swiped right in the first place LOL
I don’t like the little forehead hole 😂 By little, I mean actually not little
Idk, but I'm with you. I'm always turning my husband's hat backwards.
Any baseball cap, forwards or backwards, usually makes a guy much more unattractive to me. Reminds me of frat boys in a bad way.
because usually with most men, it hides their receding hairline 😭
Rodney has a girlfriend  https://preview.redd.it/c2xuaxx0zisa1.jpeg?width=1072&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=63aa348337fa3f5a3ded321d7d8bdd3f14b01b9e
I don’t know why you think they broke up. Her bf liked her most recent braids pics two days ago as well as some of his friends. We share a network. He’s a private guy  Hopefully Rodney apologized. They share mutual friends. Andrew and serene liked her most recent too after stopping after the show. Maybe they all have come to their senses
Lol - I’ll take that over the Clayton-being-choked pic any day! 😂
Does she have her fucking pants down?! Why is she insistent on killing people on the road just to look “hot” for two seconds on an Instagram story?!
Sweet summer child, women’s clothing is never for warmth, haha
Sometimes we like our legs but hate our arms
2.5 hours of content, .5 hour of commercials.
Ahhh I was just going to comment “it’s science” you beat me to it 😂
^^this.
He’s dating around. That’s not the girl from his b day but safe to say they all look alike
And the toilet pics 😭
She does indeed. But also I don’t find this hot like you’re literally driving with no pants on (I think she has leather seats, also), and you’re fully admitting you never expect to be pulled over by doing this. It’s just so absurd
Or functionality 🥲
100% form, 0% function 🥲 Even our socks are thin, smh
Do we know anything about who he’s dated outside just Tayshia? I don’t particularly think those two would have dated in the real world so I don’t know if we can guess based on just her. Tbh I could see Zach’s f4 being f4 for a lot of guys.
Aly, Kaity, Charity - upbeat, positive women like Tayshia.
I could see him with Kaity too, but I could also see Kat and Charity and Bailey, and a few that were dumped earliery by Zach might have made it far for Ben. Jess, Olivia L, and Aly probably would have done well on his season.
Ben Smith? Naw…. That ship has sailed far away.
![gif](giphy|EkHbiqD1yu6Wc)
I think he would have liked Brooklyn a lot
Charity, Anastasia, Aly, and Kimberly
Which of them will be open to going to see Jordan Peterson?
I think he once answered that he would’ve wanted to meet Demi if he was on BIP, if that helps
I think Kat would have gone farther than Gabi for most Bachelors, she just has the classic Bachelor contestant vibe. I was surprised that Zach took Gabi to F2 honestly as usually the women who are super outwardly insecure grate on the lead at some point, and Zach especially didn't seem to have much patience for that except with Gabi.
I think Kaity would be in most peoples final 4. She’s just the type imo
Maybe on another show it would be just a few but uh 😬 not this one
What an absolutely awful thing to say.
Hmm interesting! Wouldn’t have guessed that for him. Brooklyn has kind of a Demi vibe, maybe she would have done well.
Yup.
TIL Teddi is in a relationship. Nice ring tho
Congrats to Teddi! Last year’s Paradise girlies are very booed up.
Congrats to them!  Remember when Teddi got Clayton’s FIR? Feels like another universe.
Cute!!   I see a lot of comments saying Teddi just wanted to lose her virginity. During her season she said she wasn’t waiting for marriage but that it just never happened and that she was now just waiting to fall in love.
That was quick!! It seems that almost all the BIP 8 women have booed up post-season: Teddi, Sierra, Eliza, Lacey, Victoria, Jill. I think only Gen & Brittany are still single as far as we know.
andrew’s punching the air right now 😭
With that dress, I'm guessing she knew it was coming.
Wow that was franchise style quick! But congratulations to them!
Didn’t even know she was dating anyone.
I was gonna say damn they haven’t been dating very long then I remembered I watch the bachelor
Holy cow that was quick, but… get it girl!
What?! Already. I thought they just started dating like less than 6 months ago? Congrats to them though. And she looks lovely.
These people move fast
Bach ppl move so damn fast to marriage the second they’re off the show
Oh wow I didn’t even know she was dating anyone! Congrats to her!
She is doing a Q&A on her Instagram and said she wants a short engagement. I know she posted him for the first time in January but I am wondering when  they actually started dating.
Everyone saying, “Already?” like we don’t all watch a show where people are supposed to get engaged after spending 12 hours together, lmao
Someone please check on Andrew
I remember people saying she should give Rodney a chance in real life as if he and Andrew were the only two men in the world and Teddi doesnt strike me as the type to be an exclusive play thing for a guy  He’s not on social media and that’s a pretty nice ring. Looks like a win for her.  Teddi is the biggest paradise winner for getting the hell out early and not looking back lol
Omg did he do this in Napa? Looks like Castello di Amorosa
Whaaaat  How long have they been dating?
![gif](giphy|3oEjHChKVxgKFLM2ty)
Just curious, how long have they been dating?
He’s cute! I’m really rooting for them! I hope Teddi continues to have a good head on her shoulders. It’s easy to think someone is “the one” after you haven’t dated much or just recovered from a nasty breakup.
Oooh now she can be one of those fancy nurses who can't wear her ring to work because "it'll rip through the gloves." (I also would not wear that rock to my nursing job).
Dude am I the crazy one or do people not realize they’ve only known each other for a few months? I would be holding a full on intervention if this was one of my close friends  I know there are always exceptions to the rule, but statistics don’t lie about the likelihood this ends poorly 👀
she’s dating someone?? lol
Wow that was quick!! Good for her though 🥰❤️
They look super happy! I love it when BN people get in relationships with people who are not influencers--  the ultimate "for the right reasons" choice.
Whoa, this was...fast! Didn't she just hard launch a few months ago? And she was single in paradise (presumably). So definitely less than a year together.
Wait what? How long ago was Paradise?
This comment section is wild
Congrats but whoa, so quick!?
Andrew and Rodney were never her type she should of kept her peace and not’ve gone lol congrats to her
Teddy’s ring > anything designed by Neil Lane
Incoming comments from people claiming they only knew their husbands for oNe wEeK before they got engaged
Absolutely love this and DAMN girl that is a rock!!!!
Rodney punching air rn
That rear profile of him is nagl but I checked her IG and he sort of looks like the hot British dude from The White Lotus S2
Congrats to the happy couple 🤍🤍
I just went to her that page, he's handsome too!
Love this ring
Bach nation gets engaged so dang fast! I’m starting to side eye my man! Lol
She's so pretty, congratulations! Ahhh young love. When you know, you know.
Goddamn that ring is enormous lol
Someone check on andrew 🥲
Did not know she was dating anyone! Congrats!
Damn, that was fast from BIP, but congrats.  Now what's the secret to getting my BF to propose. It's almost been 4 damn years.
Oh that's wonderful. So glad for her sake she didn't end up with anyone from the show. I really liked her.
Bombastic side eye
I’m so happy for her!
Anyone else think the stone could be a Moissanite? No shade - my ring is Moissanite!
Wow that didn’t take long. Congrats to her. Also I lover her ring. Round cut with a plain band 😊 also that’s good clarity  https://preview.redd.it/wh879puijfsa1.jpeg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c39bfa569ecccca2832cd90d794840f7043109d3
Good for her!! Her ring is beautiful too. 😍
now why was I under the assumption that they only recently started dating?! wow, time flies!! but congratulations to the both of them; I wish them well!!  edit: clarification
“Let’s get *me* married” is very telling
Beautiful outcome for a lovely woman.
Awwww good for her!!
Does anyone else think the ~circumstances~ of this engagement/wedding are similar to Madi’s
Wow... Fast, but why not. Love is a great thing!
Will she have a “worth the wait” veil tho?
I love the ring
Not sure if this has already been discussed but is he actually the reason she left BIP?
If anyone on this sub is hating on Teddi they’re THE most hypocritical people there is because they follow the bachelor, but think this is too fast? Be fucking for real
You guys I dont think shes waiting for marriage lol [https://www.instagram.com/p/Cm5ilWnItYu/?hl=en](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cm5ilWnItYu/?hl=en)  https://preview.redd.it/py87sqrcafsa1.jpeg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f67b49e37f1ba9d9e75e9c8f0ff217e2151b3e41
Ummmmmmmm lol
Congratz that’s a huge rock!
Stunning ring wow
my jaw dropped omg??????
anyone know how long they have been together?
Yay, Teddi!!!! 🤍  Sometimes when you know you know. Some of the happiest couples I know were on the shortest timeline because they just KNEW. Everything made sense. Whereas I was just taking to a friend today who’s been with her boyfriend for 6 years and seems kinda meh about it.
https://preview.redd.it/6fz8w5yb5msa1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a4e58cc5eee56aae8e9c18b891c0bc9e0e6fb8cc  She's looked at wedding dresses and hired a planner already
That ring is so large it’s bordering on gaudy
Are they at the Castello in Calistoga?? And congrats to Teddi!
Wow! That ring. How big is that???
On that Madi timeline.
Why do people question others’ timeline for relationships? People do what feels right to them. Let’s be happy for Teddi and her fiancé. Let’s celebrate love and not judge by the calendar.
Teddi has great happy ending. She met her beau in January and fast forward three months later, they are now engaged.
UO but it’s giving ✨worth the wait✨ vibes if u know what I mean 😇
ok but like... that dress feels like this whole thing was planned. who wears basically an engagement dress coincidentally on the day they're getting engaged??
Ok Teddi won. That man is beautiful.
Wow congrats
People do realize you can be engaged literally for years before marriage right? Engagement means nothing until the wedding day
Not an April Fool's joke?
Anyone know his name???
Love it and love fast engagements lmao you don’t get a prize because you waited x amount of time to get engaged guys! But this is coming from someone who got married like 4 months after meeting my husband 😂
Love Teddi
Beautiful diamond! My ring is a carat, or between 3/4-1 carat, so not that big, but it is a circular shape like that and a gold band!
Awww!! So sweet!  That's one heck of a ring! I hope that's a sign he earns well and values her highly, because I low key love it when someone from the show who is a sweetheart does super well, especially after giving BN a big FU for how they were treated.  I love that she left because the show was messing with her. She put herself first.
it's the "no socks on him" for me
That young beautiful angel is engaged to that balding see through shirt man?!
Yikes, so many haters here. The same people who say don't be negative and judgy too. This sub is full of hypocrites.  For a subreddit that prides itself on being inclusive and open minded, there are tons of judgemental close minded people here. Everyone's experience is different!  Oh, and my parents knew each other for like a month and have been married for 38 years. Also in India, people do arranged marriages where they know someone for a relatively short time and which a lot of times work out. Two of my friends did this and are in very healthy and happy relationships.  When you are judging how long someone knows someone before they get engaged or married, you are also judging their point of views and culture. So much for the wokeness and culturally accepting narrative this sub prides itself on🥴.
Sorry but she ALWAYS gave me the ick 😵‍💫
Time to get another bf.
Not speculating too heavily on her sexuality but for some reason I really thought Teddi would end up with a woman. This video is cute also lol.
Someone wants to lose their virginity 😭😭😭
Wow. Look at that basic cartoon ring. Well it’s huge and that’s all that matters. He must have spend all his money on it and that shows true love. 😑
I was hoping for Teddy and Andrew
Always liked Teddi, I'm happy she's found the one!
Right? I went to creep on her Insta. Looks like she’s intentionally not saying his name?
Even a few of the guys are booed up 👀 Kind of bummed we won't be seeing the two besties, Aaron and James, in paradise
Thank you for clarifying this. It's feels like a minute since Clayton's season.
I was going to say this too that I thought people may think they got engaged quickly because of the sex thing like Madi and they may not be wrong but I do recall she said she wasn’t necessarily waiting
Lacey is dating someone too? No idea.
Really? Sierra? Eliza? Lacey? With who?
Shanae?
![gif](giphy|10rHZ6K9jYvLUc)
I also got engaged in a white dress… I was slightly suspicious but my friend picked it out under the guise of us getting dressed up for girls lunch. Felt kinda stupid after 😂
Agreed
I think she wanted out of BN. She went private mode.
Yeah, I don't think they've been together very long. She first posted him in January of this year!
That dude really wants to have sex.
Better than the 12 hours they spend on the show though.
That’s why they’re on the show lmao. They all believe in flash-engagements
That was my first thought as well
Very 4TRR
Honestly it makes me think they actually had the intention of trying to get engaged on the show, since they’re obviously open to a fast engagement!
They are engaged, not married yet.   But I think a big perk for a lot of the women on this show are the men who slide into their DMs who AREN'T from BN, but saw them on the show and were attracted to them and decided to pursue them. Some of the women married very well after the show (to hot men who adore them and give them great lifestyles).   If this guy saw her on the show, thought she was pretty and like how she acted (she basically noped out when the show tried to manipulate her and that kind of self confidence and sense of self worth is very attractive), I could see him wanting to date her and lock this down because she's a catch and a lot of men were interested in her. I don't follow them, but just knowing how she always conducts herself and her sensibleness, I'm guessing she would only marry him if he's shown himself to be very good to her and like he would make her happy.
Damn, I must be missing something in my brain because I genuinely don’t understand this. I love a long engagement (and I mean 1.5-2yrs, not like 5 lol). It’s nice to enjoy all the stages of partnership - dating, being engaged, then planning the wedding, then the wedding, etc. You have the rest of your life to enjoy being married, why rush and not get to enjoy all the other stuff that comes before it?
Maybe waiting until married before sex? That creates short engagement.
Yeah but that’s a tv show and this is real life. Plus if this franchise taught us anything it’s not to rush into an engagement 😂
Except that also doesn’t work lol
😂😂
![gif](giphy|xTiN0NOr8JabQstXVK|downsized)
He liked the post
Andrew Arthur fisting so hard rn 🤜🏼
amen
Ooh you’re right, it does look like it!
The wine there is really good. But it’s def a bit touristy.
The castle is so loud and there are always a bunch of kids running around. Probably the least romantic winery spot they could have chosen.
MY REACTION EXACTLY esp being the first thing I saw on Reddit this morning 😭
I’m pretty sure less than a year lol
My husband and I were together a total of 3 months before we were married. Going on 12 years. When you know, you know.
She shouldn’t wear it to work anyway. Gemstones harbor all sorts of bacteria and can put our patients at risk. Best to wear a plain band or placeholder ring instead :)
ive heard nightmare stories of diamond rings causing skin tears on patients 😵‍💫 absolutely not
Not a nurse but one of my jobs is in fitness and I rarely wear my ring at work and it’s nowhere near as big as hers 😂 I just get worried about it getting messed up while lifting weights or doing yoga stuff. I have a designated plain band for fitness stuff. I’m sure she’ll get a silicone band for work.
She’s also very religious, though
…she went on the Bachelor lol
Statistics because they haven't known each other long, or because they're young?
Omg seriously. And even in this post you have people being like “I married my husband after four hours and we’ve been happily married for 47 years!” - I never respond there because it feels like an attack and I’m not a hater, but there are SO MANY more people who ended up getting divorced really quickly lol.   I got married after six months of a blissful courtship and got divorced a few years later - my marriage was pure misery and there are more of my stories than theirs and it all could’ve been prevented if I actually gave myself time to get to know the person I was committing to. You cannot possibly know anybody that well after a few months, you can just get lucky that it turns out you’re compatible after all. This is stupid, not romantic.
Yeah but what is an engagement really? It’s a present and a promise, both which can be easily reneged.
Lol this is proof that she was really there for the right reasons. And reminder, “the right reasons” are rushing into an engagement and wanting to get married and have babies asap…..right…..? 😂
In the real world it’s quick but if she was getting engaged on paradise no one would think it was quick lol
I mean but you aren't her close friend so maybe this is one of those exceptions, right?  We, the audience of her life, won't know until a few months go by or another curated post happens
I’m shocked that people are shocked about this.
Like ClareBear  No jokes; I love that this is exactly what happened to Clare too.
I believe Paradise filmed last year in June, and she hard launched in January of this year.
I think they filmed Paradise last summer around June!
People are still mad and didnt sacrifice herself on BIP I guess.
Hello, it looks like you've made a mistake.  It's supposed to be could've, should've, would've (short for could have, would have, should have), never could of, would of, should of.  Or you misspelled something, I ain't checking everything.  Beep boop - yes, I am a bot, don't botcriminate me.
The show was trying to force that. I remember her saying Clayton was her type and she wanted to meet Ben from Tayshia’s season  They were obviously trying to force situations on that beach last summer
bet they will use the word “hubby” too!
I love how these people never realize that it is pure dumb luck that they have remained married — they are simply lucky that the person turned out to be the person they expected long-term because after one week, it’s a total gamble whether that person has anger issues, financial problems, mood swings, a secret child, a secret spouse, addiction issues, infidelity issues, etc.   It’s like, great, you took a leap of faith and it worked out and that’s awesome. But it’s like telling people “hey I didn’t study at all for the test and still aced it so you shouldn’t study either” and thinking it’s good advice. It’s not.   For every story of TrUE LoVE after 3 days, there are a million more stories of people who failed to vet their partners and paid a hefty price for not doing so.
Nah 2 days, wE jUsT kNeW, yKnoW?
This comment makes me sad for you 💔
Sorry but this take ain't it. And using capital and small letters to make the same joke everyone has tried to make about certain types of people is just unoriginal and lame.   For a subreddit that prides itself on being inclusive and open minded, there are tons of judgemental close minded people here. Everyone's experience is different!
Andrew 😂
There are def a couple of pictures where he does.
no dont use the as a guide LOL. I think its far better to be SURE by dating for a long time before legally binding things. I didnt get engaged for 6 years which I was totally fine with bc then when we did get engaged I felt super secure that I knew we could truly go the distance. a year is still honeymoon phase and I think its very stupid to make a lifelong decision that quickly. it can work of course, but the risk factor is way higher.
Cute af comment 😌
Hey, not sure if you were serious, but some stuff I’ve seen help my friends:  1.	⁠Sit down at a time you’re both not otherwise stressed, and ask in an open way (no blame, no guilting) if he wants to get married - like at all, in his life.  If his answer is yes, go to question 2.  If his answer is no/I don’t know/maybe or any variation of confusion/non-direct response, it’s a no. You can either stay with him unmarried, or leave and get married to someone else. If it’s been 4 yrs, you’re both adults, and he still doesn’t know if he wants marriage - I suggest you leave.   2. Next question is - does he see marriage with you. If it’s been 4 yrs, he should know if it’s a yes or no. He may not know when, but he should know if it’s you.   If he says yes, go to question 3.  If he says no, it’s a no. You leave. If he says “I don’t know”/“I need more time”/any variation of he doesn’t feel sure in you *after 4 years (and you’re both adults)* - it’s a no.  You need to either make up your mind to stay with him unmarried (don’t do this) or leave and get married to someone else.  3. After he’s said it’s you he wants to marry, your next question is - what does he need to do/what needs to happen/what are his goals before he feels ready for marriage?  This is basically asking them if they feel they need to accomplish any career goals, get to some financial point, get to some age, before they feel they can take that next step. This is normal for a lot of guys. Depending on his answer, you proceed in a few ways.  If his answer is something that’s tangible and achievable in a time frame you also accept, good. Skip to question 4.  If he can’t answer exactly what he’s waiting for/his answer is intangible and a “feeling” he’s still waiting for after now 4 yrs together/if his goals seem way too big to be achieved in the time frame you also want to be married in/if he has goals but doesn’t seem to be working forward them, you have your answer. It’s a no. You now decide to either stay with him unmarried, or leave and get married to someone else.  4. If you’re here, it means your partner has said yes to wanting to be married someday, yes to marrying you specifically, and has concrete plans and a timeline for when that will happen. At this point, it’s good to communicate that you’re glad you guys had this talk, and that as time goes on - as he’s checking off the things he needs to do before getting married - you’ll be checking in here and there to make sure you guys are still on the same path.  Last important point - throughout this conversation, your partner should want to be engaging with you and actively answering these questions. A partner who’s really invested in your both’s future and cares about your dreams (marriage) is the kind of partner who you want. He may not be there yet, but if he shows he takes this seriously and wants to put your mind at ease - that’s a good sign.  Someone who acts annoyed, wishy washy, evades, can’t or won’t answer, gets mad, etc, - this is another big sign, if not the most important one. *Listen to this.* There are guys out there who want to make sure you feel secure and whose goals line up with yours. Leave, and go find a guy who, even if he’s not there yet, doesn’t leave you hanging, gives you concrete plans, and communicates clearly. Do not hang around resentfully with a guy who doesn’t want the same things as you.   Hope this helped
Save sex for marriage? Not necessarily a good long term strategy but it worked for Madi and I’m guessing Teddi
I hate to say it but unless you’re in your early 20s, if he wanted to, he would.   I’m in my late 20s, and I’ve witnessed a number of women waste years and years on men who “were just not ready,” only for those same men to turn around and propose to the next GF after 1-2 years with no pressure.   Unless you’re very young, I wouldn’t let the relationship get to a 5th year and waste more of your time if you want to get married and he hasn’t proposed.  That said, I do hope it works out for you and this is your year for a proposal! ❤️
If you figure this one out, let me know. I’m chillin in the same boat.
I feel this so hard lol
Thought the same but the jeweler says lab or mined so I’m assuming they don’t work with moissy?
Could be…it’s pretty sparkly which moissanites are more sparkly than diamonds. Would also be a VERY expensive diamond
Lab grown
Yeah in round shapes it’s hard to tell diamond from moissanite, but someone below said the jeweler who made this only works with lab and mined diamonds, so there we go.
Same! This looks so much like my moissanite, same style and everything.
Love her ring too, but just to point out - you can’t tell clarity by just looking at her stone, especially through an Instagram photo.  The graphic you have here is wrong; this isn’t how clarity is graded. Its not a subjective “good”, “excellent” type scale - it’s graded as IF, VVS, VS, SI, I, etc. Where IF (internally flawless) is really good, and SI is quite bad (slightly included: SI1 or SI2).   Round shapes hide inclusions really well. That’s why you can’t tell from the naked eye most of the time. The “Excellent” stone in the graphic above could be an SI2, which is bad clarity. Hers could be anywhere from F to SI too. Beautiful ring again, but just wanted to note this. Bad clarity (SI1, SI2) stones do not look like any of the pics in the graphic you’ve linked, other than the Excellent Cut one.
Which one would you most closely relate her ring to?? I honestly just have such a hard time determining/seeing which diamonds might fall into each category
I guess it depends on your definition of the word recently, but since she was obviously single last June while she was filming Paradise, they've been dating less than a year. She only posted him on social media for the first time at the beginning of January so that makes it seem even faster. Not knocking them though. When you know, you know!
I can see what you're saying. But I can also see how it might just be telling us that this is a conversation between herself and her audience, in which she is sharing both her news and a glimpse of the person she loves, who (and this is the important part) doesn't participate on social media and is therefore not really a party to the conversation.   "Let's get me married!" has the tone of a bride gushing to her girlies. I think it's cute.
Some of the women in Bachelor Nation aren't ready to be married. Often times, it seems like they just want the ring and title that comes with being engaged/married. I'm happy for Teddi. However, you don't know someone after only a few months of dating. People can say, "You know when you know," but the first year of dating is usually pretty blissful.
Eh, I don’t think it’s that serious.   I’m recently engaged (4-months), and it’s the same way I talk to my girlfriends when my fiancé isn’t there. Lots of jokes about how much of a bridezilla they’re gonna have to deal with, my ideas for the wedding, etc. Weddings are often things women bond over or tend to have more interest in, so when it’s between a girl and her friends (rather than the couple together addressing friends), it often focuses on the girl, and I think that’s pretty innocuous.
Oop. Can you elaborate? I’m curious 👀
At least Teddi’s not out here blaming it on her god and posting photos of her cheugy-ass evangelical family Factory.
I thought the same thing
We don't know that she's waiting. She said she didn't like that her mom tried to control her sexuality because of her own mistakes, and she wants to make her own choices in this area and it's no one else's business. On the WTA or one of those shows, she made an amazing stand and said that NO ONE should gate keep an adult woman's sexuality. She said she understood why her mother was that way (she became pregnant in her mid teens so wanted Teddi to not be sexual at all) but it's not ok to do.  Chances are, if she really loved this guy (and now they are engaged), she may or may not have (but I don't want to guess because it's disrespectful to her, but to only point out we don't know and she made a great point about people asking, thinking they should know, thinking they can tell a woman what to do, etc... all not ok).
🤣
I don't think so. Based on her cryptic posts after she left I think she was having issues with production.  Rumor has it that she was interested in pursuing a relationship with Rodney when he came to the beach and the producers basically told her no, they wanted her to keep seeing Andrew even though she really wasn't that into him. She rightfully didn't like being told what to do and that's why she left. (Obviously she hasn't spoken about this herself, and she probably can't, so take this with a grain of salt).
Not discussed but girl said she was into Clayton and wanted to meet Ben smith and they were trying to force a triangle between three people of the same skin color when she wanted something else. Producers need to stop  They just gave eliza her storyline
I don’t think anyone watching the bachelor genuinely thinks the show’s set up is realistic in the real world. Most people watch it for entertainment, not becuase we think the show’s method is a good way to date, let alone get engaged.  It’s fun TV, so we give the timelines a pass. So when a couple goes outside of the show, into the real world, and still seems to follow the same hurried timelines, we’re all like “what”.   Rushing a relationship is never a good idea. Take your time and date.
Even the contestants admit the engagements are not legitimate so let’s not be intentionally obtuse.
![gif](giphy|JJjnYC0upzy36)
This pic makes me feel like I’m intruding on something lol
I don’t think a couple month old post where she was having her first new years kiss ever and now she’s engaged is great proof of that if she’s religious lol
They both have clothes on in this pic though. I don't think it's proving anything.
Why was she crying at the beginning???
Paradise filmed in June of last year. She hard launched him back in January of this year. So, under a year.
That’s the problem if you go too big with a round diamond it looks like a door knob.
I’m jealous of it too
Ya, I’m not a fan of this style. It’s been trendy for awhile (i think less so now). They look like bubble gum rings. She loves it though, that’s what matters!
It looks just 2-2.5 carats, so i wouldn’t say it gaudy-big. It’s pretty normal in lots of parts of America.  But again, i love big stones on plain bands, so maybe I’m biased 🤷🏽‍♀️
I know she probably has tiny hands…but STILL! Did that thing sink the Titanic? 🧊
Because this is a discussion subreddit focused on a show revolving around these people and their relationships.
Exactly. And also in some cultures people get engaged and married faster. For a sub where people want to be an ally and antitacist to see this amount of judgement is disappointing. Let people live lol.
She mentioned him in December but didn't disclose who he was. She quarantined with him because of Covid. It might have been November.
She’s never said she was waiting til marriage.  She may or may not, but that wasn’t what she said.
Exactly
Lots and lots of people know when they're getting engaged and plan it... personally I would never want a big public engagement if I didn't know exactly when it was coming! I'm really glad Teddi knew and also felt ready to get engaged fairly early into their relationship.
A lot of couples plan their proposals together these days. Not everyone wants it to be a surprise
I mean, not all engagements are a surprise, and not all people who want to be proposed to enjoy surprises. Some people might prefer to arrange to look nice and hire a photog for the occasion, etc!   Not saying this is the case here, but when you have 100k+ Insta followers who need content, staging a proposal wouldn't seem strange to me?
Maybe she just wears cute dresses often
Or maybe her now fiancé told her to dress up!
https://preview.redd.it/cksqvglf5msa1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=05adfe16a93a2000e8b4e9a5752b576753f6d0c2  Looks like they're planning on getting married soon
Nope, it's for real
Nicholas. No social media.
My husband and I dated for 5 weeks, engaged for 7 months and have now been married 13 years. 4 kids and still happy as clams.
I was started dating my husband in may and  was married to him that august! that was almost 7 years ago and we have a 6 month old now :)
We were fast, too. Lol. Moved in together after 2 months, engaged in 6 months, married 5 months after engagement. We've been married for 14 years, have 5 kids, and are happy and healthy. This is why it bugs me when people talk shit about age/timeline. He was 23 when we met, and I was 29. He was more mature than most 30 somethings. 😂
You can literally see the edge of his sock right at the edge of the tongue of his shoe. I can’t believe people still think just because you can’t see someone’s socks they’re not wearing any. There’s like 3 or 4 different kinds of no show socks meant to not be seen outside of the shoe. Some are called liners and just cover the toes and barely come up along the side of the foot and only about an inch up the heel
You can see the socks lol
the tight cropped pants with no socks must be stopped
Criticize his shirt but he can’t control his hairline
He's definitely attractive from in front and the side, just a bad angle. Plus who cares a about this when your characters vibe
Yikes. Let’s not body shame - men or women.   Relationships and marriage are not all about external beauty. I’m sure he’s a good, kind, loving person who Teddi sees as sexy and handsome for all the things he embodies, not just his looks. In the same way I’d hope he sees her as a wonderful person as a whole, not just “a young beautiful angel.”
He's hot. This isn't a good pic. He's tall and fit and has a great face and a great torso.
There’s a few photos in her IG and he looks better from the front lol but that was my first thought
Hey….don’t leave out the pants and no socks
You got a shot of the rock. So what you can’t see the face of the man that provided it? He is secondary to her moment! Haha. Jk.
Why do you think it’s ugly? Seems pretty neutral and classic to me?
What century is that from?  19th?
Being inclusive and open minded doesn’t mean accepting everything that comes up in life. It has been widely studied and validated that people who get married before dating for a significant amount of time have higher rates of divorce.  The fact that you know a handful of people who didn’t fit the statistic doesn’t mean it’s still not true. That’s why everybody is saying this kind of quick engagement is a bad idea.  As for the fact of arranged marriages in India, I come from that culture. Marriages being binding because of strong cultural and societal pressure, which doesn’t allow divorce, doesn’t mean that’s a culture of successful marriages. I’m glad your parents worked out. But how many women (and men) in our culture have suffered or are currently suffering in bad marriages becuase of the toxic way we view marriage (once wed, never to be dissolved)?  If people got married at 3 months due to it being arranged, and then weren’t allowed to leave, that shouldn’t be a point of pride or a point in support of short courtships. That should be a criticism of that cultural practice as a whole. That *absolutely* deserves to be judged.
Ok? I got married after knowing my ex husband for six months and he abused me for years and now we’re divorced. There are more stories like mine than stories like your parents.
[removed]
Why
Lol why did you think that? I never got any wlw vibes from her (granted, I do have pretty bad gaydar for a lesbian)
Wait didn’t she say that she was just waiting for a serious relationship to lose her virginity, not waiting for marriage
What?
Lol what?  Basic cartoon ring? A round brilliant is the most timeless shape there is.   And it’s probably a lab. It looks around 2-2.5 carats, meaning they spent $6000-7000 or even less on it.  I.e. the average engagement ring price in America.   There are a lot of people who get big rings simply because they like them. And since labs came around, many people can enjoy big beautiful stones without breaking the bank, let alone breaking a sweat.   Don’t know why you think someone liking nice things is wrong, or how you’re sure someone you don’t even know is going broke to show off to other people…  It sounds like a lot of jealousy and projection, my friend 😬
It's in her stories! His name is Nicholas.
We might see Aaron in paradise who knows
Here’s the [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/thebachelor/comments/zz7bh3/lace_coming_through_with_a_soft_launch/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) about it. And I misspelled her name: it’s Lace.
They learned their lessons and moved away from BN guys lol they posted unknowns and are pretty private. Giving the sh*t storms the women went through you can’t blame them
Yep! On Sierra’s IG there is a post with her BF. The others posted stories with their new guys, which were reposted here. If you do a quick search of their names in this sub you’ll see threads about the various launches.
How could I forget about Shanae! lol! Not sure about her. I don’t follow her (nor most of them), and I don’t recall seeing anything posted here about a new relationship.
I’m pretty sure I read she was privately seeing someone too. All of the women have gone private and back to normal life except Genevieve and Brittany and the two who got engaged (though victoria and Greg seem settled in Nashville)  I think Jessenia mentioned she was privately dating too when asked in her stories. She went back to Texas.
She said she's not waiting for marriage anymore, just a serious relationship.
Wait- is he saving himself for marriage?
![gif](giphy|XeLcgh8gT8o0F5SQ8i)  I forgot she's also saving herself
Yeah I literally thought that to myself after I posted it. “What do I expect from people who go on a reality tv show designed around getting engaged after a few weeks” 😅
Good point. You can tell which ones were truly serious.
Agreed. Clare is a classic example of this - went off the show, successful guy who’s genuinely good slid into her DMs, bam married and happy.   Honestly if it’s an equation that works, get it ladies.
Also most of the successful couples have said that they didn't treat the engagement as an actual engagement but as the start to dating in the real world. It's basically just a free trial of a ring while you figure out if you're compatible. Definitely not the same as someone proposing after a few months of normal dating.
Fair point 💀
I honestly don't get why people down voted you. For a subreddit that prides itself on being inclusive and open minded, there are tons of judgemental close minded people here. Everyone's experience is different!
👏👏👏
Another statistical mark against them… Teddi seems great so I hope for her sake they last. But young, religious, and fast engagement is not normally a winning combo.
That's a tv show engagement though
Exactly my thought. I mean, I also think it’s crazy when people on the Bachelor get engaged after knowing each other for two months, but if the general population isn’t going to get upset over that, I don’t see how anyone can get upset over Teddi’s quick engagement. 🤷‍♀️
Both. Especially in combination.
👏👏👏  ![gif](giphy|8m5dizh7ghyEPIWIx1|downsized)
Eeek that’s such a sad way to look at an engagement though. If they don’t take it seriously, what is even the point?
Eh, in the real world, not the show world, it means a lot
Just like marriage. 😅
🤣 haha that’s true
I think every couple who gets engaged on these shows is full blown delusional personally lol
This is real life though!
Most couples date for several years after their paradise "engagement" before actually getting married. If they don't (like Grocerena), I would definitely be sus haha
I mean, you can hope to be the one exception….or just wait and date longer and not pray to be the exception.
She's super religious and she's young, winning combo 🤡. Wish her the best tho, I think statistics aren't in her favor but outlook is a lot better since she went for someone outside of the show.
Crazy it feels like it was not that long ago! Super happy she found someone though.
😂😂🤦🏽‍♂️damn
Ohmygod why is this 100% accurate 😂😂😂
I always roll my eyes so hard when someone says “when you know, you know!”
And yet some experiences are statistically not ones you should partake in - like getting engaged after knowing someone for less than 6 months- becuase more often than not they lead to bad outcomes.   This has nothing to do with inclusivity or open-minded. You can’t be open-minded about something that’s already been tested and proven to be a bad idea. That’s just being dumb
Both!! LOL
Aw, this was super sweet and nice of you to type out!   I would say we're at stage 4, the waiting game lol We discussed having a 'deadline' of by August and I know he wants to surprise me, but anything slightly romantic or date nighty makes me 'could this be it' flags go up, so it'll be hard for him to surprise me haha
Hey, not sure if you were serious, but some stuff I’ve seen help my friends:  1.	⁠⁠Sit down at a time you’re both not otherwise stressed, and ask in an open way (no blame, no guilting) if he wants to get married - like at all, in his life.  If his answer is yes, go to question 2.  If his answer is no/I don’t know/maybe or any variation of confusion/non-direct response, it’s a no. You can either stay with him unmarried, or leave and get married to someone else. If it’s been 4 yrs, you’re both adults, and he still doesn’t know if he wants marriage - I suggest you leave.  2. Next question is - does he see marriage with you. If it’s been 4 yrs, he should know if it’s a yes or no. He may not know when, but he should know if it’s you.  If he says yes, go to question 3.  If he says no, it’s a no. You leave. If he says “I don’t know”/“I need more time”/any variation of he doesn’t feel sure in you after 4 years (and you’re both adults) - it’s a no. You need to either make up your mind to stay with him unmarried (don’t do this) or leave and get married to someone else.  3. After he’s said it’s you he wants to marry, your next question is - what does he need to do/what needs to happen/what are his goals before he feels ready for marriage?  This is basically asking them if they feel they need to accomplish any career goals, get to some financial point, get to some age, before they feel they can take that next step. This is normal for a lot of guys. Depending on his answer, you proceed in a few ways.  If his answer is something that’s tangible and achievable in a time frame you also accept, good. Skip to question 4.  If he can’t answer exactly what he’s waiting for/his answer is intangible and a “feeling” he’s still waiting for after now 4 yrs together/if his goals seem way too big to be achieved in the time frame you also want to be married in/if he has goals but doesn’t seem to be working forward them, you have your answer. It’s a no. You now decide to either stay with him unmarried, or leave and get married to someone else.  4. If you’re here, it means your partner has said yes to wanting to be married someday, yes to marrying you specifically, and has concrete plans and a timeline for when that will happen. At this point, it’s good to communicate that you’re glad you guys had this talk, and that as time goes on - as he’s checking off the things he needs to do before getting married - you’ll be checking in here and there to make sure you guys are still on the same path.  Last important point - throughout this conversation, your partner should want to be engaging with you and actively answering these questions. A partner who’s really invested in your both’s future and cares about your dreams (marriage) is the kind of partner who you want. He may not be there yet, but if he shows he takes this seriously and wants to put your mind at ease - that’s a good sign.  Someone who acts annoyed, wishy washy, evades, can’t or won’t answer, gets mad, etc, - this is another big sign, if not the most important one. Listen to this. There are guys out there who want to make sure you feel secure and whose goals line up with yours. Leave, and go find a guy who, even if he’s not there yet, doesn’t leave you hanging, gives you concrete plans, and communicates clearly. Do not hang around resentfully with a guy who doesn’t want the same things as you.  Hope this helped
Aaah I didn't see that!
I’m guessing lab grown. My bet is Teddi would want one as it is the most ethical choice.
Probably lab grown. In this size, it would be a $40-75,000 for a mined stone, and unless they’re in a high six-figure earning rage I doubt they’d shell out that much. In lab you can get this for <$6000 these days.  No shade, mine is a lab too.
Good
Good/very good. It doesn’t look poor quality. It’s a really nice ring
There’s no way to tell from looking at it. Let alone through an Instagram photo. Rounds hide clarity really well, which is why you can’t tell a good clarity from bad clarity stone just by looking at it.  Unless it’s really included, only a jewelers loupe is able to tell clarity apart. This could be an SI2 (bad clarity, and the lowest most jewelers go), and it would still look like a good stone to the naked eye.
I mean not everyone posts their partner on social media as soon as they start dating
Agreed!  I think if her guy is so private, these photos and captions are a great way to handle it and respect his boundaries.
Hubs and I got engaged after 4 years of dating. Engaged for two years. We’ve been married 9 months. In July, it’ll be 7 years together (and 1 year married).  I knew he was the person I was going to marry about six months in. We met my senior year of college and he was in grad school. We waited so that we could have good jobs and financial security. Nothing wrong with waiting, even if you know it’s the right person.  It’s funny how people seem to fall into two categories. It’s either “nothing wrong with waiting to get married even when you know” or you’re someone who says “we have our whole life to get to know each other. Let’s get married after two months.”
Me vs us
No. Production wanted a triangle. For her to bounce between the two and she wanted neither. She didn’t want to date any guy in front of Andrew nor string people along to give a forced triangle. She said production wanted her to be cruel and was being cruel to others
Why would she post themselves naked lol do most ppl waiting straddle each other on a bed🤷‍♀️
I was thinking the same thing -- and also isn't Christian 'waiting' often a code for no, um, P in V? It's not like an outright ban on intimacy.   I dated an evangelical Christian boy in high school and probably half of the time we spent together was making out in this position with our bottoms on, lol.
I think it's a tiktok video trend or something lol like lows to highs
Where did she find a hot man ready for a commitment this soon??? Need to know for future reference 🧐
Wow that’s quick. Good for them though. Do you know if they knew each other for a while before getting together?
Holy smokes….
I think there is so much judgement though. It’s just sad to me… that’s all.
For argument's sake (b/c reddit) I'd say that being antiracist is a lot different than not being judgmental. Racism and judgment are v. different
Yeah, and many of those cultures keep that custom alive becuase they strongly oppose or even forbid divorce. No matter the circumstances.   That’s not something to celebrate or tolerate. That type of custom is one to actively question and hopefully stop doing.
>but when you have 100k+ Insta followers who need content, staging a proposal wouldn't seem strange to me?  i think planning to make content out of your engagement *is* strange when the rest of the relationship has been pretty private! like, yes i know i watch the bachelor, but i'm also like... does everything HAVE to be content!?
Hot. Haha..
Especially when no show socks are incredibly popular with women. Like it just takes a little bit of critical thinking
Really? I didn’t know those existed
this guys the sock aficionado it appears
I know that was mean. But she’s just so young. And he doesn’t look so young.
Yeah just stalked her insta and he's better looking than 90% of the guys on this show, let alone normal guys. They seem really happy!
Like 90% of guys on this show! *gasps*
Insert song of SpongeBob singing “and no girl ever wants to dance  With a fool who went and  Ripped his pants”
Talking shit about someone’s appearance (which they CANNOT control) is acceptable now? Ironic considering if anyone were to dare speak on a persons weight (which they CAN control) they would probably be banned from the subreddit. So weird
[removed]
Here is an idea, how about you stop telling people what the heck to do and invalidate their experience 👋👍 .
Yes.  She never said she was waiting for marriage
Honestly, it looks closer to 3.5 carats. I was thinking it might be a lab diamond too because she is wearing it on such a slender band (and you wouldn't want to wear a diamond that cost tens of thousands of dollars on a band that is so delicate and breakable). Diamonds are overpriced and the industry is unfair to so many people who labor in it, so I like that people are opting for lab diamonds in general.
Watched “Explained”s diamonds episode on the history and culture of diamonds. It’s an archaic cultural conditioning. I am certainly less materialistic than the “average American”.
I mean, the fact that he has a girlfriend hasn’t stopped him before, so you are probably right.
Luce?
How do these BN women always get such hot guys?? They all have six packs and broad shoulders and make me swoon.
That’s right. I got all these virgins mixed up.
She’s a virgin; I think she said during Clayton’s season that she wasn’t waiting for my marriage anymore, but that may have changed.
They’re downvoting her becuase getting married after knowing someone for 3 months and it ending up working out is a lucky outcome of a bad decision, not something to celebrate and espouse as a good choice.
Redditors gonna reddit. 😂 Sorry you're getting down voted now too.
Do you actually have stats for that? My understanding is that the evidence actually shows the opposite. For example: https://ifstudies.org/blog/the-religious-marriage-paradox-younger-marriage-less-divorce
I’m not upset, but there’s people saying this will be her “happy ever after” and other delusional shit lol  I also side eye every single bachelor/bip/bachelorette proposal with a ton of skepticism
Whether they take it seriously or not, there’s still no point. That’s my point. And it’s not sad. It’s reality.
Yes a very meaningful present and a very meaningful promise, but that’s still all it is. It doesn’t mean anything legally. Even if it were to be considered a verbal contract, it is in no way binding. One person can change their mind and it’s over. This is why the timing of an engagement shouldn’t matter to anyone because it’s really just a very expensive public letter of intent.
That’s a promise with the government which I would recommend to avoid making
God, same. It’s just survivorship bias - everyone who got married really fast says that, until they get divorced lol.   I really hate it, honestly. Fast whirlwind engagements get so romanticized and it’s basically always a bad idea, but Nancy who married her husband after a week and a half has to chime in every time.
Oh perfect, then you’re straight chillin 😎
First, thank you for this thoughtful information. Second, as a very type A person, this was a magnificently organized response and I love it.   We have walked through these steps. I know he wants to marry me. He is a wonderfully caring supportive loving man, but he also has ADHD and an engineer brain. I think part of his delay is he is over thinking what ring I want and how much they are. He is a bit in the bougie side so he is thinking it’s going to cost him like $10k or something ridiculous and thinks you have to pay upfront, even though he has a list w pictures of what I want in my ring. The other side is the adhd and procrastinating. I think the convo we need to revisit is #3 to set some standards because if it’s not by the end of this year, idk what we are doing at this point. We are basically married without the title which doesn’t sit well with me.
You cannot get that for $6k even in lab. That looks like 4+ carats. 3 carat with decent (not amazing) specs starts around $10.5k on brilliant earth. 4 carat starts at $18k. Hers is massive.
Yup! I didn't say otherwise 😊
Yes. Plus, it reads like the most generic engagement announcement. There’s nothing personal whatsoever. (I don’t even know who these people are)
Yes they were wanting a Teddi-Andrew-Rodney (or someone, might not have been Rodney) triangle but she had already decided she didn't want Andrew and they were basically saying too bad, so she bounced because she's actually a decent person and doesn't roll like that. Good for her!  Either way the root of her issues were with production. Glad she found someone outside of Bachelor Nation! Seems like a lot of the ladies of that season have done the same.
>do most ppl waiting straddle each other on a bed🤷‍♀️  My guess would be yes. Anything but sex is fair game and they would be horny.
I think there's a difference between judgement and conversation that's valid.  If a 19 year old got engaged to a 49 year old, it would be valid to talk about age gaps and power dynamics. This is exactly what happened when Nick Viall recently got engaged. In the same way, when two early-twenty-somethings get engaged in less than a year, it's valid to talk about how marrying at a young age AND not dating for too long before engagement is a recipe for disaster. This isn't just opinion; it's supported by numerous studies.  It's not shitting on her to point this out and have concern and discussion around it.
Or maybe they filmed it becuase they themselves wanted the footage for the future (as SO many non-influencer women/couples do), and then she decided to post it anyway.   We don’t know her intentions
It doesn't HAVE to be, but trad-type milestones like this do the best numbers and if social media is a path you're choosing, it would be a pretty poor decision not to capitalize.   God, I'm cynical.

My husband started balding at 19. It is not always related to age.
You’re right; it was mean.   Why are you so obsessed with youth? You do know they’re both going to age right?   If he’s a kind and wonderful partner to her, as long as the age gap isn’t concerning, why does it matter if he is/looks older than her? It’s good that youth and beauty isn’t all she focused on when she looked for a life partner - those things fade, and as long as you’re attracted to your partner, what matters more is that their character and values line up with yours.    This is such a strange thing to say and be hung up on.
I knew guys who started losing their hair in college.  Influencer guys just tend to hide it.
And more importantly doesn’t have ig and purchased a pretty nice ring so likely a real career  I was looking at many of the women on that beach thinking that could do so much better outside this franchise. I was team no engagements tbh lol
I’ll hate it every time I see it
Imagine if this was about someone from your background or race, I bet there would be no 'I know' responses. Hypocrisy is a terrible problem.
Yeah it’s hard to tell exact carat weight unless we know her finger size. Definitely at least a 2, but you’re right - could be as big as a 3 or 3.5.   As for the thin bands and labs vs naturals - people are doing thin bands with natural stones all the time, I’m afraid. Look at TheClearCut - all their stones are natural and they’ve been doing predominantly thin bands in the last 2 years to keep up with the trend. Or RingConcierge - naturals on thin bands again. All this to say, we can’t tell it’s a lab vs natural just by looking at the band size. These popular jewelers are saying they’re just as stable (they’re not) so plenty of people are buying them for their natural or lab stones.   I guessed it’s a lab bc I don’t think Teddi or her fiancé are in the millionaire earning range, who could drop a casual $75,000 on a ring.  The only huge rings in BN I’d guess to be natural are JoJo’s new one, Clare’s, and Madi’s. Everyone else - Kaitlyn, Becca, Nick Viall’s fiancé, now Teddi’s - I’m guessing they’re all labs.  ETA: all this to say, no shade on labs. I have one myself, and I love it 🥰
I’m sure you have plenty of things you enjoy that you don’t mind dropping money on. Whether it’s tech, materials for a hobby, a yearly boys trip, nice tickets to a sporting event, good seats for a concert of a favorite artist, a new backyard bbq, a redo on your backyard patio, etc.   Everyone has different things they enjoy. You might spend money on such things, but not see it as materialistic, because society doesn’t label them as such. But you’re still dropping the same money on them nonetheless.  The only difference here is society has deemed a lot of women’s interests as “shallow” or “materialistic”, for  absolutely no reason.   If someone is otherwise frugal but wants to spend $5000 on a ring they’re going to wear their entire life, and jewelry is something they love and brings joy to them, how is that different from spending $5000 for a once-in-a-lifetime court side seat to see your favorite basketball team play when they get to the semifinals?   People enjoy different things. If you don’t judge a guy for spending their hard earned money on an much-awaited boys trip or parts for a beloved car, examine why you would judge a woman for spending the same on something they love.
cackling
🤣😂
Probably because they’re all really hot themselves? I think it’s easy to forget how beautiful many of these women are because we are always seeing them together, making them seem a lot more average.   But put any of these girls in a room of actually average people, and I bet they get approached alllll of the time by cute guys.
Hot women get hot guys!
Nooo she didn’t she said she was waiting for someone she fell in love with not til marriage!
It's all coming back now. I forgot that she was saving herself for marriage. All the comments relating her to Madi are making sense now 😅
The Institute for Family Studies is a right-wing think tank. This report from Pew is a bit old (2009) but talks about how divorce rates are highest in the Bible Belt states where people marry young. Obviously there are a lot of potential factors here, but generally speaking I think it’s safe to say rushing to the altar while young, especially if it’s a “saving sex for marriage” scenario, is risky. https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2009/10/15/the-states-of-marriage-and-divorce/
LOL this comment 10/10
It’s definitely not 4+ carats unless her finger size is like a 10, which it’s also not becuase she’s a smal person. I’d guess her finger size is around a 4.5 to 6 at most, which would make this a 2-3 carat  And you can absolutely get a 2-3 carat for <$6000. I got a 4.5 G VSI and it was $5200 pre-tax.
I’m so against forced reality storylines and production pushing and pulling these people like puppets. I don’t know why they just didn’t let people be and gravitate toward whom they wanted. But I agree I’m glad most of the women from the beach seemed to have moved on from this franchise. Maybe under new direction there will be changes to bip as well because last summer was miserable and only provided two connections, and both were predetermined, out of all those people who went to the beach
That would put yourselves in a precarious situation especially on a bed, it's the start of every story lol most ppl set up boundaries
There is judgement here, make no mistake. Read the comments and jokes here with capitalized letters and all.
You’re making a blanket statement for all. I’m sorry, but no! To each their own to decide. Personal freedom to CHOOSE. And, the comments I’m referring to are about the duration to which one dates someone before getting engaged. Who is to say? What is good for me is not good for all. For the record, my spouse and I dated for about 2.5 years before getting engaged. But my brother met his wife and proposed 3 months later. Who cares as long as people find each other.
Little ballerina man
Wow his socks are way too small they’re supposed to go over the ankle I thought
My husband is 29 and has been going gray as long as we’ve been together (7 years).
I’m not hung up on it. It’s Reddit. I’m sure she’s happy. Not that deep
Lol fair
I’m pretty positive it’s a lab, Jean Dousset has a lab diamond line called “Oui by Jean Dousset.” Nothing wrong with that! Saving $$$  I don’t think we know much about Teddi’s fiancé, but I doubt he could afford a natural diamond that size, especially considering how quickly they’ve gotten engaged.   I like the setting, although it’s a bit thin. I think the stone overwhelms her finger, just in terms of proportions.
What about the twins? They had huge rings, but their guys were in high paying jobs, so I figured theirs were real (and they would be angry if it wasn't).   I think Arie got a real one because it was part of a sponsorship (a few people worked with diamond companies to promote them when there was a proposal, so they may have gotten heavily discounted rings). Mine is real but from an estate (pre-owned) so it was a steal, very inexpensive... I didn't want a new diamond after finding out about the industry and back then lab diamonds weren't so popular or beautiful yet.
Not sure where the sexism stuff came from. I would not blow a ton of cash on tickets, cars, or most any luxury item. I came from poverty and use most of my disposable income on habitat restoration. I wish we could evolve past these nuptial gifts and focus on matters of the heart.
Right, on the show, but she said that growing up she had intended to wait until marriage.
Thanks!
There’s no way that is a 2c. I have a 2c round brilliant in the same setting with a 4.5 finger and this is huge compared to mine.
If you go down in clarity to visible inclusions, yes. My search is always VVS1-2.
You’re right, there is. But that’s what happens when people make bad decisions - judgement follows. When Nick Viall got engaged to somone like half his age, people judged him, saying that kind of age gap is not cool. Similarly, when someone very young gets engaged within at most 6 month of knowing someone, people judge that bad decision.   People are allowed to make their own decisions. Doesn’t mean everyone else is going to accept and applaud them.
When did anyone take away Teddy's freedom to choose? She has the freedom to choose and people have the freedom to discuss those choices in a larger societal context. Getting engaged quickly may "work out" for some, and maybe for Teddi too, but that doesn't mean it's generally a good idea.
No one is saying *everyone* who gets married too early is going to divorce. Or taking anyone’s choices away. They’re saying, on average, people who don’t date long enough get divorced. So it’s advisable not to do so. This isn’t an opinion, this isn’t about telling anyone not to do it, it’s just a fact supported by data.   Now what people do with that data is their own decision. But the fact exists, and acknowledging it doesn’t mean anyone’s choice is taken away. So yes, your brother, and anyone else for that matter, can still get married at 3 months. But he is statistically much more likely to get a divorce than you, who dated for 2.5 yrs first. That’s all.  You ask who cares - the reason people care is becuase this kind of information is important for everyone to know, so that they don’t make the same mistake and end up becoming a statistic. The same way age gaps are important to warn young women about, so they can be wary of getting into relationships with much older men, it’s important to talk about and acknowledge other not-so-healthy relationship trends (not dating long enough before making a life long commitment) so that others have better chance at healthy long-lasting marriages. Knowledge is power. That’s why people care.
They’re made that way so they don’t show above the shoe. A lot of men like it that way especially when they dress up or casual dress like with the loafers. They go up to size 14. They’re supposed to look like that
You made two successive comments talking about how young she is compared to him, as well as her attractiveness compared to his lack of it. That seems a bit hung up to me, but you do you 🤷🏼
Yeah I wish she’d gotten a thicker band, but then again I hate the thin band look so I’m definitely biased.
Which twins exactly? All I remember as twins are Joey and Justin, and neither are engaged.  A lot of the sponsored rings are labs too. I remember Arie upgraded Lauren’s a few years ago (2020 maybe? Or 21?) and labs hadn’t yet dropped in price to what they are now. So if hers was a lab 5 carats, it could have still been like $30k, which is worth getting paid off through a sponsorship. Or it could be a natural, honestly. Hard to tel
And that’s very understandable that with your past you focus on non-tangible things. But not everyone thinks that way, and that’s ok.   Materialism is a pattern of overconsumption beyond ones own means, seemingly for external validation. A once in a while purchase that means something significant to you, and is within your means, is not materialistic.   Also, it’s possible to spend on both goods and give back to the community. My fiancé and I volunteer weekly at an animal shelter, and we foster 5-6 kittens at a time at home to reduce the burden at the shelter and to give these animals a better environment. In addition to that, my fiancé is a nature-enthusiast like you, so for his 30th birthday this year we bought land in a deforested area to be protected and returned to its original state. My parents, like you, grew up poor. My family, now better off, has a fund that gives scholarships to academically gifted yet impoverished kids back in our home country.   But on top of that I have a big ring I love. And my mom has nice jewelery she loves. It was within our means, and jewelry is a shared love. As much as we give back to others and causes that are important, why not make yourself feel special becuase you’ve worked hard for a better life. And neither of us feel any shame in that.   All this to say - people aren’t black and white. You would see my ring and immediately put me in the same category as you put this couple - “wow she must be materialistic and breaking the bank to show off to others, while I’m over here saving forests”. Not knowing anything about all the other things I value and spend money on.  You can let yourself have nice things AND be a good person who cares about others. Or, if you genuinely don’t care about tangible things, don’t buy them. But there’s no reason to judge others who do. You categorize people as either all bad or all good based on one instance in their life (buying a ring) and have this holier than thou attitude. Its based on 0 data or knowledge about others, and all it’s doing is serving your ego. But that’s not reality.
And she ended up changing her mind and said she would be down to do it in the fantasy suites! It’s not the same situation as Madi
>Thanks!  You're welcome!
Have you taken a pic of your ring and compared it to this photo? Diamonds photograph bigger.  And I agree. 2ct would be the lowest I’d guess here (if her finger is a size 3.5-4), but even if her finger is bigger (4.5-5.5), this can’t be bigger than 3.5cts. A 4+ round would look insane on her small finger.
https://preview.redd.it/xaebuoep0lsa1.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=046feb2e4b4ad69cb8acdae3f4b3546a41ed66be  This is how a 4 carat looks on a 5-5.5 finger. And I am guessing her finger is even smaller.  Her ring does not look this big. This is why I’m saying it’s at most a 3.
You don’t have to go VVS for rounds. VS is more than enough, and often even SI. The beauty of rounds is they hide inclusions very well.   Some people defintiely prefer higher clarity jsut for piece of mind, so I defintiely get you. But we have no idea if Teddi does. So hers could be a SI1 or 2 for all we know.
Again, mine is a 4.5 G VS1, and it was $5200. I got a 3.4 F VS2 last year and it was $4200.   Labs have variable markups depending on where you go.   BE does a lot of marketing, resulting in wide popularity, so they know they can do huge markups and still be fine. If you go to other places, you can get them for cheaper.   My 3.4ct was marked $18,000 at BrilliantEarth, but was marked $4200 at RareCarat. So I got it at RareCarat.   The 4.5ct was $26,000 on BE, $8000 at RareCarat, and $5200 from a third place I looked. So I obviously got it from the third place this time.
Let’s agree to disagree!
Another thing to consider is that men are like, the #1 danger to women? It’s easy to be on your best behavior for less than a year.  When I got engaged and married after a few months, I thought I was being carefree and romantic. I thought the worst case scenario was that it doesn’t work out and we get divorced - who cares? My ex husband was very thoughtful while we were dating, super nice to me, never in a million years would I have assumed he’d be beating my puppy, throwing me into walls, and torturing me less than a year later.   If we had dated longer he probably would’ve shown me a red flag or two and given me a chance to end it. I never thought I’d end up in that situation - I thought I was too smart, I wasn’t an insecure girl settling because I didn’t think I could find anyone better, I can recognize a red flag when I see one, I just literally did not know him and I married him before he had the opportunity to show me what he was really like.
I was high and messing with you lol sorry
I just think a lot of women will regret this trend of less than 2.0 mm wide bands. Their rings will eventually warp and they’ll need to purchase new settings. It’s not practical for an engagement ring and doesn’t last a lifetime, even though I like the look because I have smaller hands. Teddi’s looks about 1.8-2 mm to me, so hopefully it lasts!   On another note, I find the 18k rose gold very flattering on her skin tone!
Blonde twins, I think from Ben's season? I don't remember their names so I will google...  Emily and Haley.
My feelings are based on many similar posts. Maybe it does not apply to Teddi. Maybe she is the exception. I’ve heard similar arguments as yours before when I raise concerns about mega churches and wasteful spending on “nice things” for Jesus. Ultimately what we have here is a different value judgement on jewels. You see how happy it makes her and I see all the need for more thrifty use of those funds. Really, those whole subreddit just ain’t my tribe. My wife kinda pulled me into it but I should probably keep my snarky comments to myself.
I didn’t say it was.
Yes I’ve taken pictures from the same angle. She has much more finger coverage. I would believe 3.5 if she has extra tiny fingers, but it truly looks huge compared to mine.
I would believe it’s on the higher end of 3, but it’s certainly not 2. It’s not far off from the pics you posted and we don’t know her ring size.
https://preview.redd.it/c76c7xrd5lsa1.jpeg?width=3662&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=33776a1c05f3c6aba10abf5a3acf80d5d5e84afe  These don’t look far off from hers. 🤷‍♀️
Yes. So it could also be $20-30k+ easily depending on her specs.  Or a 2k moissy. Who knows. But it is massive.
What kind of cut? I always filter for the best cut. That is not a C I would sacrifice and that has a huge effect on price. And drastically lowers price of mined diamonds as well.  The prices I listed were for very good to super ideal. So it’s middle of the road. I would be surprised if you could get the best cut available in that size for 6k. Where did you source yours?
Wow, I’m sorry you went through that, but I’m glad you’re out. And youre so right - couples are often in the honeymoon period up to the first year of a relationship, and they only settle in to truly seeing each other for who they are after that. So it’s good to only commit to marriage once your rose-colored glasses have come off and you can see whether you truly fit, without the hormones affecting you.
Yeah only time can tell for sure. I definitely think the 1.5mm bands are a disastrous idea. Will definitely warp (at best) and you’ll lose your stone (at worst). 1.8 and up? I think they’re ok, depends more on your lifestyle, if you take it off for certain activities, etc.  I got a 1.8mm at first but then literally reset it because I got too nervous just looking at it lmao.
So their jeweler does both labs and naturals. Their fiancés are young and new in their careers, and neither come from wealthy families/old money. So I doubt they’re natural.
Yeah it's fair to say giving money to the church (aka giving money to the pastor) is bad, and that a lot of Bachelor people are very fame/money hungry and wanting to stunt on others. It's just not good to always jump to that conclusion *whenever* you see a nice ring, claiming people must be materialistic, breaking the bank, etc. Unless someone has shown a pattern of frivolous spending and superficiality (which Teddi hasn't), you have no idea what people's intentions are. So you making the assumptions you're making just screams unnecessary judgement and meanness.  And like I said, there's nothing wrong with once in a while spending on things. We all work hard to earn money not so we can continue to deny ourselves things we love in the line of being thrifty. If Teddi's fiance earns $300,000 a year, and spends $5000 once to buy his fiance a nice ring she loves, is that not being thrifty? Are you saying he shouldn't have even spent that and given ALL his money to charity? That's not what being "thrifty" means. That's unnecessarily denying yourself...for what?  Very few people like to live that way. Like why even work hard at that point.  It's good to have a balance - work hard, and spend money on a few tangible things that are important to you (jewelry, tech, etc) while knowing that it's good to spend most of your money on experiences or things that bring value to the world. We have no idea what Teddi's fiance spends money on otherwise, so there's no need to jump down someone's throat when they once in a while buy something nice for themselves. That's not what being thrifty is about.
My bad!! I misread your comments
Agreed. I doubt it’s a 2. I posted pics of 3cts on a size 4.5-5.5 hand too, and even they look bigger than what Teddi posted. So again, I think it’s closer to 2.5-3.
Again, unless she shopped at the most upmarked places and then got further ripped off, no. Both of my stones are 3.4-4.5 carats, colorless, VS, ideal cut, and neither are anywhere near that price. A lot of people shop around for labs, and it’s good to do so.
The 3.4ct is an ideal cut. The 4.5ct is an emerald-cut with excellent polish and excellent symmetry. (Only rounds are graded on Cut, and fancy shapes like emeralds get graded on polish and symmetry, which is its equivalent, and this stone has the highest grading in each category for that). So essentially both them are ideal cuts. And I paid <$10,000 for both combined.   Again, price has little to do with the quality of a diamond because different places have difference markups. The 3.4 was listed at $18,000 on Brilliant Earth, and $4200 somewhere else (for the same stone). The 4.5 was $26,000 on BE and $5200 somewhere else.   So don’t go but price; if you find a good stone, take the GIA certificate number and see if you can find it somewhere else for cheaper.  This is why I said you can get 2.5-3cts for less than $6000 easily.
One (Emily I think?) married a hockey player who plays for the Vegas Golden Knights and he signed a large multi-year guaranteed contract a few years ago around when they got engaged. Hers is probably natural because he could afford it, lol.   The other (Haley?) married a hockey player too, but I don’t think he’s been as successful. So maybe.
6. Enough about you,  here's a ton of weird shit we do as a family!! (This would have been my family!)
Off the top of my head 1. Ariel, Tino 2. Vanessa, Victoria F (lol) 3. Jason (Gabby) 4. Charity, Nayte 5. Gabi, Zach
You forget Ariel’s dad is a new category.  “Why am I expected to give 100 percent when he’s not even sure.” Or something like that
Where does Dean’s dad fit in this because that was the most fascinating hometown of all time.
Joe Coleman’s dad deserves his own category lol
Confirmed, Divi..Dani Austin
Did Bekah promote Divi previously?
Function of beauty it wrecked my hair
Convenient after she’s probably promoted it so many times on her own instagram to make commissions
Dani Austin?
You’d think bekah would know better than to buy a shilled shampoo/conditioner from an influencer
Maria Nila is a great brand, good upgrade
Not saying it’s this because it could be a number of things but my hair has become a lot drier lately and I have been using JVN. Doubt it’s him since he’s a celebrity not an influencer. Maybe Brad Mondo since he has a hair line.
Maria Nila isn’t a influencer brand I don’t think. Pretty sure it’s a professional brand. Could be wrong
Not surprising
The next slide she confirmed it was Divi lol
Same
Same! I've never had anything wreck my hair as badly as they did. It was like straw.
Yes! My hair started falling out in clumps when I used it!
I used one of the conditioning color masks during the earlier days of the pandemic and it was amazing! made my (at the time) platinum hair this gorgeous pink for 10 days or so, and also made it super soft. I might try more of their products now that this post reminded me of the brand!
I wanted to love Maria Nila but the structure repair shampoo and conditioner left my hair so greasy!
Yes no one said Maria Nila was an influencer brand. Bekah said she uses MN after having a bad experience with an influencer brand.
Do you remember if she promoted it tho? Curious if she was shilling a code for crappy shampoo/conditioner since she is little miss not like other influencers lol
I think she did but specifically the serum. She said in her stories she still loves the serum but is having issues with shampoo/conditioner
Wow, good for her. She's cute!
Wow, totally random but still very cool!! 😀
Definitely!!
ahhh love to see it!!
With Pelley I’m always at…  ![gif](giphy|Su6TJioZW5I31jeIES)  \*(There’s always a Peter GIF. 😂)
When she co-hosted Clickbait she said they are just trying to stay quiet and private this time around. She referenced Peter quite a few times throughout the podcast it seems they are fairly intertwined.
Call me crazy, but I think they are that couple who breaks up every other day and then get back together. Hence why their interactions are so hot/cold. They actually could have lasted if they met outside of the show and when more mature as they have similar upbringings and hobbies. While Kelley plays confident, she strikes as super insecure about Bachelor days (don't blame her) and Peter is an immature flip flopper so it doesn't help.
I just love how Barb comments on all his photos except for the ones with Kelley in them. Like gorl, spillllllll.
I listened to her on Victoria F’s podcast Uncensored Saints, they talked quite a bit about Peter & how they got back together and all the sweet things he does for her. Victoria made a comment about him being obsessed with Kelly and this was maybe 2-3 weeks ago. Pretty sure they’re together, Kelly said she’s the one wanting to stay more private
He was storying that he is headed to Stagecoach in three weeks. We will probably know if he’s single by then or shortly after.
I have no idea but they strike me as that couple who is constantly breaking up at every party because one of them was looking at their phone while the other was talking or whatever and then making out in the corner by the end of the night.
I’m leaning towards them still being together. Last week Kelley wore the P+K necklace that Peter gave her for Christmas. Also, just today she told the astrologer, who allegedly has predicted their reunions & said they were written in the stars, “we love you”, which I assume meant Peter/Kelley.  Dustin is moving in with his girlfriend so I’m curious to see what Peter does.
![gif](giphy|mD4R60lVrEcog5h2pd)
Even if they haven’t, I feel like it’s a matter of time. It’s not even so much about them together, but Peter’s entire family seemingly being against their relationship and refusing to acknowledge Kelley’s existence, does not bode well long term.
They’ve still been liking each other’s posts; I think Kelley has just had a bunch of work/personal commitments in the last month and Peter’s been doing a lot of flying. I think he usually clusters his flight schedule so he can have a lot of uninterrupted time off. I’ll start to be a little more suspicious if we don’t see them together in the next few weeks or so though.
If they broke up, TPTB better be on the phone RIGHT NOW and offer PP a hefty sum to go to the beach this summer 👀  Edit: typo
Barb may have struck again!
Anything is possible. They do seem more private, but also not as attached to the hip. The last time, maybe because of the pandemic, they were always together and posting. This time they aren’t, so it’s harder to tell if they’re together or not.
![gif](giphy|l2G3wyEkUMp4m1kVQK|downsized)
I think they are choosing to be more private
Definitely makes sense to keep their relationship quieter after what happened last time
![gif](giphy|eMhFNmDOCqoubGU5or)
I feel like I see this as post every month. They are prob that couple that’s on-and-off a lot.
I hope not; What’s wrong with me that I actually think they’re cute in a deranged way and I want them to last? 🥲
Who knows but they're definitely not ending up together lol. Even someone as messy as Pilot Pete doesn't usually end up with someone they've dumped like 3+ times.
something feels really off and strange about her in general. like she seems really uncomfortable or like shes trying to be a poser by what she posts on instagram. she feels inauthentic basically
My prediction, purely based on the speculation of this post and my own love of reality tv drama: Kelley & Peter break up by mid-May. Peter appears in paradise (maybe shows up week 2-3? Early enough to stir the pot, but before everyone is coupled up). He dates several women on the beach, but ultimately, he ends up single after the woman he decided to move forward with gets cold feet and won't accept a proposal. Paradise ATFR comes around and he's with Kelley again (they actually get a segment to talk about it during the episode)
The fact that he keeps going back to his F5 is so hilarious to me. F1, 2, or 3 if they were single, yeah, whatever. 5 didn’t even make hometowns!
I've been wondering this for a few weeks now. All signs point to yes. So sad to be dragged through the mud. Not sure who is doing the dragging but if you break up 3x it isn't going to be a healthy relationship
I sew someone says they have liked each others posts, but I haven't seen that
I am legitimately baffled that people pay such close attention to these people's Instagrams or really even care if they are together lol
Soft launching the breakup
The fucking band-aid will never not get me lmao.
How long ago was this? If he doesn’t show up to her sister’s wedding though, agreed they’re dunzo?
coming in 5th place when my boyfriend literally had a chance to choose me on national television would make me INSANE sis needs to dump him for good if she can't move past it
They DID meet outside of the show at a hotel before filming started!!
I wonder what happened between them because she seemed to love Kelley at first.   It’s amazing that his younger brother can get married with no trouble but Peter can’t keep a girlfriend because of his mom
Angel on earth or it didn’t happen
Omg really??? 😂😂😂 Barb is going to be a nightmare MIL to someone one day.
Barb is forever my fave messy queen. This woman should have become the host after Chris Harrison idc
I just watched the scene the other day where she’s begging Peter to choose Hannah Ann. The histrionics I tell you. It’s more unhinged than I remembered. She would be a nightmare MIL but she’s great content tho
Barb is the pettiness GOAT
Oh awesome they’re filming this year’s BiP Prologue! 😂
Man this is accurate lmao
Isn't Peter's lease up soon?
How come? Someone else mentioned this recently when another thread was asking the same and I had no idea? I thought barb loved Kelley and didn't they even hangout with Kelley's fam?  Eta: the first time Peter and Kelley were together I mean
![gif](giphy|jQDAgynYKFSvioZ5xm|downsized)
By dating other people
I would simply pass away if we got Pilot Pete on sand
in hindsight at the time they both admitted heavy manipulation from TPTB
If you follow them both, you see their stories and posts. It doesn’t take rocket science to notice
did you post this just to be a jerk? because i see no other reason why
Was recorded a month ago
When is her sister getting married?
>coming in 5th place when my boyfriend literally had a chance to choose me on national television  I cannot stop laughing at this thank you  pete is my all time favorite reality show rake-stepper. his mom, the finale, this--so so amazing
It doesn't count as he already was set to go on to be the Bachelor and she knew it.
I’m guessing that SIL is either a complete doormat or she and her husband keep their mouths shut around barb…
I’m reality she’d be the worst MIL tbh lol.
I assume so as I think it has been about a year since he, Dustin, & Clay moved in together.
Not sure what made them dislike her, but my theory is it's about how she spoke about him to the press and in interviews after their initial breakup. She made some comments about his lifestyle, hobbies, the way he is in relationships, what he does in his free time, etc. that weren't the nicest. I'm sure his family was upset she did that, and then surprised and unhappy that they got back together. But at some point his whole family unfollowed her on social media. Any time he posts pictures on instagram with her, his family does not like them or comment on the posts. Alternatively, every single post he makes without her, they all like and make various comments, so it's very obvious they have an issue with her / the relationship.
I really want Barb to start leaving long effusive comments on Hannah Ann's Instagram posts. It wouldn't surprise me at all lol
![gif](giphy|kC8N6DPOkbqWTxkNTe)
Cmonnnnnn let this happen 🥲
It's pretty odd lol
I have no idea how what I said is even remotely jerkish lol
Or she likes / is more possessive of PP
A nightmare. I wouldn't want her within 50 feet of me in the real world. But she is television gold
She is literally my ex-MIL. Good riddance.
I know social media isn’t everything but it would appear Peter’s SIL gets along with her pretty well. Hopefully she’s not as bad as she appears 😬
![gif](giphy|RfT1YTJ4zsVjfMbqjj)
Do you follow them both?
Wait when you say literally do you mean *literally*!??? Spill!!!
MIL’s like her are basically when things are good, they’re good, but the switch is easy to turn off and when it gets bad, it’s war. Some ladies out there are saints and can manage someone like Barb, and then there’s ladies like me, who won’t stand for someone to have that much control in my relationship. My best guess is SIL keeps her mouth shut and let’s Barb think whatever she wants.
No lol I have much worse things to do with my time like browse this insane sub and waste my time responding to all these ridiculous posts.
HAHAHA nooooo pilot Pete or his brother are not my ex-husband. Just being basic overly using the word literally 😂 I wish pilot Pete was my ex husband- way better than the one I have! LOL.
Well there you go Jan that’s why you don’t understand how easy it is to pick up on. See ya on another stupid post 👋
See you soon big fella!
It would be really cool if the show hired Rachel to be the pilot for one of the dates they do when they fly somewhere.
Aw I enjoy her off screen presence so much, TPTB really robs us of the leads' personalities, especially when they seem to be super fun and genuine people
I want to hear more flying and teaching stories. I think Rachel’s Bachelor/ette era may be the least interesting thing about her!
I really hope she follows her dream and gets to work for the airlines at some stage.
I had no idea working for an airline was hard to get to as a pilot
I love hearing about the day jobs of people on the show. I remember Jill is an architectural historian and made some pretty interesting tiktoks about it
I think Rachel is such a badass for being a pilot and flight instructor. And I think she’s badass for embracing her emotions and not being afraid to express them. As a fellow girlie who cries in public, I feel seen
I want to hear Rachel's story time about the RPM gauge failure, that sounds wild
I respect her being a flight instructor so much. I fly quite a bit but I never can get over my uneasiness, especially if there is turbulence. I can’t imagine being a pilot, and really can’t imagine flying in small planes with people who are just learning how to fly—that literally sounds like a nightmare. Good for her lol.
Also someone tell that girl that no she should not be trying hit up her ex to hang 2 months later
Call it a hot take and maybe this should be in the UO thread but I like both Rachel and Gabby and don’t feel the need to pit them against each other or drag them down. I think they’re both great girls who got the shitty end of the stick when they made them both bachelorettes because I’m sure it created a sense of insecurity for both of them which likely made them “annoying” ..but I think any duel season would have turned out that way. It just wasn’t a good idea. I do tend to agree with the people who say gabby would have been better on paradise but what can you do people were begging for her to be the lead at the time. I feel for Rachel that she felt like the “not wanted” bachelorette that let to a lot of her emotions.   I am glad they have remained great friends. I hope we get some content from them soon and I wonder if they will venture down to the beach together haha
Me wondering if that ex she contacted 2 weeks after breakup was Tino….yeah right 🤣
Please don't encourage more BN podcasts.
Her flying stories are so fascinating to me!
Omg I forgot she went to OU! Courtside makes sooo much sense to me as a bar for Rachel. It’s the athlete bar!
the idea of flying a plane is so outside my comfort zone so it’s really impressive
I love Rachel! I never understood all the hate she got on her season. I find her way more relatable than gabby
These are charming.
I’m excited to see where she goes as a pilot.
I don’t want more podcasts. What I do want is more info from her on her flying experiences! It’s honestly so cool she’s a pilot ❤️
Who was Rachel’s F1 again? I feel like it was overshadowed by the Erich drama
Fourth slide has me howling lmaooooo
So glad she will be flying again!  She can pull a PP and do influencing as a side hustle.
That wine is my favorite go to! So so good.
I enjoy her flying stories!
I would listen to a podcast with a little fashion, a little dating life stories, a little pilot stories, and then Bach gossip
I hope she actually goes back to her career - it’s sad when former BN become permanent influencers.
I have really liked Rachel from her time on the show and after, and tbh find her more relatable and funnier than Gabby ever was.
No more podcasts dear god pls
Do the exact opposite sounds about right
another podcast? lol, I can’t 😝
I would love a non-bachelor podcast from them. Like please no more clickbait or happy hour but something more off the bachelor books, if that makes sense. 😅
I 100% would listen to their podcast
Im so over everyone coming out with a podcast
Courtside Pizza is where I work!!!
why do so many influencers go to OU
I need this podcast to exist!🥰
I’m glad we can all laugh about how much Rachel sucked as a bachelorette now lol
So she says you can contact an ex? I’m confused by her reply.
I’m going to disagree with Rachel here. Courtside Pizza is not the best bar in Athens.
two black girls one rose *has already played on the “two girls one cup” joke* so i will riot on their behalf if these girls try to play off that name too. that’s all i have to add  edited to add the italics since the point was clearly missed
This is callback gold
Her co-pilot could be Jake Pavelka
She’s back down to earth now
It’s wildly competitive and the pay is absolute trash. And if you’ve paid for flight school yourself (as in didn’t learn in the military) you’ll like be carrying a lot of debt. Regional airlines like spirit, allegiant, etc is where most pilots start and the pay is similar to that of a public school teacher.
actually pilots make very very good money, and they are part of a union, so there are great protections and pensions.  I live close to DFW and have a lot of friends who work for American and Delta.
I’m so mad that I relate to her response HARD😭😭
I love both of them! Their season was a mess not entirely of their own making, which is such a bummer. ANYONE would be in their own head and feeling self conscious in that situation.
Sorry but your use of "duel season" instead of "dual season" had me cracking up. Now I'm imagining a season where people have to duel to stay on 😂
I feel like in a parallel universe Susie would be Bachelorette and Gabby would rule paradise.
I’m hoping it means whatever musician/artist this sub linked her to because then maybe that means she’s single and mingling 👀
She seemed 1000% done with him at AFR but you never know!
ahh it’s still wild to me! I went to kent state but I considered OU and rachel’s my age - what could’ve been 😭
Are there many diff types of bars for diff types of students at OU
Every time I see this I keep thinking it’s Oklahoma university lol
Lol
The part that scared me a bit: (when talking about teaching)- “you have to let them make mistakes”… uh WHAT?? Piloting is probably one of the very few professions where you cannot let them make ANY mistakes. Am I alone here? 🫣
![gif](giphy|6GblLlyc3UL3FQr0jr|downsized)
Tino lolol
I used to work at the same hospital as Gabby and I thought it was a little sad that she completely is done with nursing, but at the same time I also understand because the job is ridiculously stressful for little pay, and clearly she is doing fine as an influencer.   I thought it was refreshing to hear that Kaity was going back to her nursing career, we just really need all nurses on deck still because we are still feeling the effects covid had on the healthcare field.
I find working a 9-5 pretty sad in this economy lol
rachel made me laugh out loud several times watching the show and gabby never did. not saying gabby isn’t funny in real life, because we know TPTB love to edit out any semblance of a personality, but i was always confused why everyone on this sub acted like gabby was a comedy genius and rachel was boring
Same! I'm definitely a Rachel fan 🌹 Idk what it is but I've always liked her and keep liking her more and more.
Same here! I ended up liking her way more than Gabby on their season and never understood the hate she was getting.
I relate more to Rachel too! I like both of them. And I find gabby hysterical. But I’m definitely not the cool girl. I’m the emotional screaming, crying, throwing up girl. I feel like that personality type the producers have a field day with and make them out to look unstable and annoying, but to her critics: imagine being in her shoes. I think more of us would come across like rachel and would probably be more susceptible to producer manipulation like Rachel.   I am still holding out hope that with Fleiss’ exit we start getting better television, better drama, and better love stories.
I liked Gabby more on tv and Rachel more off tv. I think she’d be so fun to hang with irl.
wait really?! what other influencers went there?!
The way multiple people had to respond telling you no like they’re being forced to listen us soo🫠  I would listen too tbh.
Please no more. The web is so oversaturated with bach podcasts already.
No thanks
Nah
Both were bad.  But if the two I think Rachel was better than Gabby,
I think her whole point is that people shouldn’t take dating advice from her lol
maybe not the best but it’s high on the list for me! what’s your fave??
They’re all gorgeous in their own way. Besides Crystal. Fuck Crystal
Gabby was def making a two girls one cup joke. I don’t think it has anything to do with two black girls one rose pod
Were you on the internet for Two Girls, One Cup? It’s like a core (unfortunate) memory for millennials on the internet. Both the extant podcast and Gabby’s joke name play on that. She’s not stealing it from the podcast, they’re both the same joke in different iterations
Nah he was hella abusive I hope they don’t bring him back ever
That’s insane, then the flight attendants must make very little too.
Omg I had no idea that’s awful
I had no idea the pay for pilots was that bad. I thought Pilot Pete and his dad made decent money??
Literally. The bachelorette is supposed to be their time of feeling loved and wanted and instead they had to constantly not only deal with America comparing them but also the guys and not knowing if they were into them or the other more
i’m a fellow ohioan (former ohioan i guess) but i had no idea people from out of state went to OU. i wonder why she chose that school coming from florida!
Yes lol there are like twenty bars 💀
Damnnnnn wow that full scene just punched me in the face. Thank you 😭
Tbf, kaity has significantly less followers that Gabby (I adore both girls) but I imagine it’s a lot easier to say “I’m gonna go back to work” when you have less than 300k vs 1M.
9-5 is generous these days with modern expectations. I’ve been practicing law for 5 years now and I am just… tired. I’d do some bullshit influencing in a heartbeat
Yes! It was so confusing to me, gabby IMO tries too hard while Rachel felt genuinely like a lighthearted person
Becca Moore, who is famous on tiktok RN, went there! Also some of the girls from dance moms went. I can't remember which one, I didn't watch the show, but this girl I know got her man stolen by the dance moms girl HAHA
I actually disagree. Rachel was the one that was constantly losing her cool and throwing fits (when Gabby got more attention, when a guy switched, when she got rejected, etc)… Gabby was pretty chill until the end. I really don’t have a positive or negative opinion on Gabby as a lead. But Rachel was just badddd lol
Hahaha. That makes more sense.
Damn I got downvoted a ton. But my favorite in Athens is probably Tony’s. I did spend a lot of Wednesday nights at liquor pitchers at Lucky’s though and my group of friends really liked going to pigskin because there were big booths.
Crystal reeks of piss all of the time. Also the last time I went there these frat brothers were filming a pledge having sex in a stall so I told the bartender and left.
yes, obviously. that doesn’t change the fact that a bach related podcast has already ripped off that joke and if gabby and rachel seriously decide to create a podcast, i would hope they choose a different name.
yeah i was unfortunately there for that whole thing lol i know where the name is coming from, but it’s already being used by the 2 black girls 1 rose group.  i should clarify i’m not accusing them of stealing the name but i hope that if they were serious about starting a podcast they would look more into it and see that the format is already in play by another podcast
I don’t know any flight attendants who are in it for the pay. It’s solely for the perks of free/cheap travel
Flight attendants get paid shitttt. From my limited understanding, most airlines only pay from wheels up to wheels down too. So if they’re stuck in the tarmac, they aren’t getting paid for that. Wild.
And it’s still better than being a flight instructor! My friend that’s a flight instructor makes $13/hr
PP and his dad fly for major, non-budget airlines. And Pete was likely only able to get in as young as he did due to his dad’s long career and industry connections. Just a guess.
The splitting up rose ceremony was so messed up. Like everything about that was bad
Wow lol that blows my mind as a small town person
Lol that final fight was something else, the notebook, him taking his shirt off randomly 😂😂 so dramatic
Kaity won't be going back to work.  She'll be a full time influencer in a couple months
So true. I’ve also been in corporate for only 5 years, albeit in marketing so I’ve had some high stress jobs and some less so, and it all just feels so meaningless and exhausting sometimes. I would happily give it up to post some pretty pictures online and collect a check
I agree. At the end of the day I ended up liking Rachel more on a personal level than Gabby, but she was 100% a worse lead.
We spent most of our time at The Pub and The CI, but definitely hit up Courtside and the Pigskin quite a bit too! And always made time to pop into Tony’s for a Hot Nuts :) Sorry about the downvotes! I love all things Athens/OU so I had to ask!
I mean it was very clearly a joke. I doubt they’re starting and podcast and if they did that prob wouldn’t even be the name.
I think it’s also clearly a joke and they’re not going to start a podcast with that name or in general
That’s so unfair too because I see them working before the flight takes off. I make sure not too big them beforehand because of that.
Wtf!!! Jesus we need to pay people more
That’s exactly it. And his dad was ex military so he became a pilot for free - once you’re working for a delta and flying international you’re making $$$$$ it’s just an extremely difficult gig to get
That's really interesting. I had no idea it was so competitive but makes sense, it's a cool job.
Athens is a small town with a population of about 20k, but the student population adds about another 20k and it’s a big party school 😂 the downtown area near campus is just literally only bars and they thrive as businesses 😭
Him leaving!!! And her having to follow him outside. I don't know how I forgot any of that 😭
No I literally started laughing cause it was so funny and unhinged. He got up and left 3 times. And then she caught him taking his shirt off like what a mess
Maybe, maybe not. We’ll just have to wait and see how things play out.
I think Kaity might stick it out a bit longer than most simply bc from what I’ve heard, nursing in the US is an upgrade from nursing in Canada. Not that either are easy jobs, but I’ve heard nursing in Canada is particularly brutal and the change of pace might help stave off some of the burnout temporarily
I just didn’t like courtside because when I went to OU, courtside and crystal were the underage Greek bars. Pub was great too, I also went to The Union and Jackie O’s (before the fire) to catch a lot of live music. Also went to Cats Eye a bunch a watch the Browns.
idk why this is the second comment acting like two influencer besties starting a podcast would be the craziest thing to happen.   comments under me have been talking about how much they would love a podcast from them—so in the same vein as entertaining this possibility, i’m entertaining their chosen name just the same.
i mean, maybe? but also i could totally see them starting a podcast, esp if they get a lot of positive response from this
Oh wow 😮
Yessss! I forgot about the Union omg.
Personally, I think Gabby likes to do her own thing too much. If she started a podcast I think it would be a solo one.
And 80s Nights at Casa! Those were amazing!
well that’s fair. i can appreciate your perspective.  i don’t know enough about either of these women to claim they are being 100% serious or that it’s 100% outside the realm of possibility. i also don’t really care either way, lol
Yessss Casa!
Joey lol
Oh that’s y on clickbait today he said he will be away for a “project “
I’m so curious about the premise of the show 🤔
Grocery Store Joe really changed his life with one episode of The Bachelor
![gif](giphy|Vqh2UpdHG7QGY)
But why do we keep recycling Joey?

Lol why do they always use that picture of him?
Similar to the traitor and apprentice
No offense to these other people but Alyssa alone makes this worth watching
The alternate that is listed at the end - is that Blake's girlfriend? I didn't watch that show but the name sounds familiar?
yes

Have a very distant connection to him and have heard nothing but good things!! Hope he doesn’t disappoint
He’s either our next bachelor or the winner lol
Reminds me of the pic from her date last season
It’s week 5, right? 👀
Hes so hot
Unless something crazy happens, that’s her F1. Mark my words.  ![gif](giphy|TlK63EXaV0gG8UIpnfa)
![gif](giphy|wtyYMNeJNlkAM)  i use this gif so often here im sorry yall it always applies
Hes so cute
iykyk. She knows what(who) she wants and is going after it. Excited to see Hawaii during HT week!
Wait is it week 5? And he has a one on one? Yeah he’s making at least F4 if not even F1 lol
A big week
Reminds me of Ethan zohn from survivor everytime I see his hair lol
Joey is one of my top picks. I think he’s so cute. I love his eyes and the curls in his hair
What is Joey's occupation?
Do we like what we know about his so far?
I really feel like he’s the front runner tbh
Is there a list of who’s left?
he looks cute!!:0
I hope I’m right on my preseason call of him being F1 🤞🤞🤞
Is this the guy from Hawaii
what city are they in?
How long do you think they’re in Nola for??
Yeppp. Whether it’s her or producers, he’s getting a lot of shine
Yup, I agree
Not for bachelor, but winner yes I will advocate for.
🙏 Bachelor 🙏
Bachelor will be Warwick
Why?
yes
Already??
![gif](giphy|zZZlwysKnOMD4BRJ2v)
Agree completely
It's gonna be PA 😭 and not Hawaii.
I can see that. The hair and the eyes when he smiles
Tennis instructor
Well, one of them anyway.
Yes, I would love an updated list!!
Yes
![gif](giphy|ElSnWK7Hx8sP6)
Usually week 5 1-on-1 are for front runners. He also won the kissing group date and I think his story he gave to charity was totally producer driven. Also, he got the rollerskates ken on the Barbie group date, and I’m pretty sure that’s like one of the most popular outfits in the upcoming movie lol.
![gif](giphy|l2JIdnF6aJnAqzDgY|downsized)
I just need him to be confirmed as FIR. If someone else got FIR I'll be in a tailspin 😌. He doesn't give off potential future Bachelor vibes for the producers to already be playing favorites with him, but who knows.
He won’t be FIR. He admitted on the kissing date that he didn’t kiss her night one
I made a comment about this in the spoiler thread, but it could be possible that they didn't kiss if he received it. Whether by Charity's choice or his choice. I know it'd be considered unusual nowadays, but maybe!
Possible but highly unlikely.
This is my type of dream date. However, I felt bad when they were having that difficult conversation (“I must tell you I banged your bff”) and their feet were just soaking in the swamp
Please share this to r/Thailand to anyone knows Zach and Kaity's overnight date daytime location.
Just curious if anyone knows!
the first time i read this i thought “Klong Root” was slang for some kind of sex-related thing
The worst place Zach could've done it 😂 I just visited a clear water canal in Krabi (pretty sure it was this one, which is why I posted), and there are a lot of mosquitos there. Them sitting there was just asking to get bit!
Great idea
I think she’s priced it too low. I’ve heard “normal - unknown” girls get $100+ for feet pics and she’s a more known figure
Cries in size 11W with bunions
In this economy?!?! You’ll hear no snark from me.  ![gif](giphy|W1lALbMVtPG8MAZPOF)
The second I have any rating whatsoever on wiki feet, I’m doing this
Why not. Hell if people pay for it, go for it. Why show for free.
Why did I immediately think of Michael A.’s thirst comment from years ago 💀
Honestly, if I had pretty feet, so would I.
This is hysterical. I would 10000% sell photos of my feet if someone wanted to pay for them - literally why not?? But I'm also not letting someone choose my nail polish color for $15.99.
Honestly good for her; if Internet weirdos wanted pictures of my feet I’d sell them in a heartbeat lol
I don't understand foot fetishes but good for her, get that bag lol.
![gif](giphy|AgPt9udT567spxbSHf)
I support it. If i had the following she does, I’d probably do the exact same. IMO, she deserves no shame for this
How can she do this, knowing that Yosef has a daughter at home?
[I got this YouTube Short come up last week & this random college girl was able to buy herself a Prada bag & her bf a MacBook on a whim just from selling feet pics.](https://youtube.com/shorts/eZk5FwbB5rU?feature=share)  He was like, “I don’t like that she does it” but he sure didn’t mind the MacBook!   The guys in the comments were like, “If my girl could make bank doing that, this is a team effort! I’m getting her the best lighting & taking the pics & taking her to get a pedicure everyday!”   & Katie — raise your rates. Lol.
Tbh I don’t blame her. There are some weirdos who really like feet. I’m tempted to do the same lol
I would totally sell my feet pics online if I knew people would buy them. It's a no brainer for me.  I mean feet are the least sexy part of a persons body in my opinion, if random dudes want to get off on that, so be it. People get off to regular face and clothed body pics all the time, without the subject of the photos consent, so honestly this is a better way to do it.   Girl keep riding on the coattails of that Bach fame and get it while you can.
Ok, as I sad earlier, good for her 👏🏼!!! But also, she may be using it to get material for her stand up comedy career, which is probably going to be hilarious
Good for her. This is harmless and I’m sure will give her some interesting stand up material.  Honestly I’d much rather people do this than shill Shein, Cupshe, other fast fashion or harmful health products and fads.
The bachelor executives: “Not on my Christian Minecraft server”
![gif](giphy|AgPt9udT567spxbSHf)
I would sell my feet if I could.  Work them toes, girl.
My take: I hate unsolicited sexual interest, but if I had a high profile that meant I would probably be recieving it anyway, why not make money off pics of a body part that is not generally considered private?
Uh oh Ive entered my nightmare: reading Redditer’s takes on sex work
This is genuinely hilarious and harmless. No free feet lmao
You know what's degrading? My father who is in his 70s still having to do manual labor outdoors every day because he doesn't have enough money to retire. We're selling our labor (and bodies) one way or another. Doing it from the comfort of one's home while getting paid handsomely is probably one of the least exploitative ways of doing it.   Now, if the argument is against the exploitation inherent in capitalism, I'd be more open to listening.
Is this real?
I'll never understand the Quentins out there. I hate feet, if anything I'd pay *not* to see someone's feet, they're all grotesque to me...And yet I feel like the weirdo.
My husand and I always joke that when the bottom falls out we will make an OF for his feet (they're big)
I’m so envious of people who can make money selling feet pics. You go girl. Get that bag
I mean, it’s just her feet. She had a high rating and I’m sure some guys are interested. Good for her. Get that money.
I have extremely ugly feet. Short toes, Morton’s toe, and no arches. I wonder if anyone would be interested in that as like a special kind of foot fetish?
I mean, have you seen Taylor Nolan’s OF???
Ugh I’m so jealous! 😭 wish I had the feet and following to sell my soles!
![gif](giphy|AgPt9udT567spxbSHf)
She just posted that she’s using the money she gets from this to pay off her mom’s mortgage. Good for her.
Lol I love this for her
I don't even like looking at my feet, but my rent ain't gonna pay itself   If I ever get a decent wikifeet rating, I'd sell
I am ashamed at how quickly I went looking for photos of her feet on Insta to see what she’s working with 😂
In this economy, I get it. Eggs were going for $9 not too long ago.
I wish my feet were nice enough for this. Good for her!
I do online sw and feet guys are my favorite. They're so much nicer and more normal than others lol.
Good for her 👏🏼
Get the bag, girl. I’d sell mine too if i could.
![gif](giphy|AgPt9udT567spxbSHf)
currently putting together 5 step skin routine for my feet.... 💴💵💷💶
Don't feet pics normally go for a lot more than $15.99??? Not that I've looked into it before or anything....
Good for her for putting the Thirst in Thurston.
This is so hilariously random but at least it’s giving us something in the off-season
Inflation is a bitch. You gotta do what you can. 🤣
On an episode of Younger the main character tried selling her used undies for cash, and tbh that seems like a pretty sweet deal to me
I have never once thought about her feet before but this strangely makes me want to know what all the fuss is about.
To anyone who's thinking that selling feet pics is an easy way to earn cash, I beg you to talk to a SWer. Before you spend hundreds of dollars on shoes, socks, pedicures, and spend hours of your time taking photos and videos on demand in every angle and position under the sun. And the real money comes in when you start showing the rest of your body.
i respect it
honestly good for her no free feet!!
Get it girl
Get it girl
good for her. make that money. i’ve thought about doing this myself lmao
Did you guys ever hear of that girl who used to sell her farts? She made a fortune so I feel like Katie can make bank on this.
Good for her
Good for her.
Damn… saying someone with fat money feet, no baby toe nail and 2 deep ingrown toe nails 😂😭. I say do it if you can!
i wish my feet were pretty enough for this
How did OP find this? 👀👀👀👀
The ratings don’t mean anything. Some celebs with really bad feet have 5 stars.
The bio has killed me i fear
Good for her! I wish I could do the same thing but no one wants to see my crusty dusty ass feet 🤣
Good for her. I had a friend who did this plus would let dudes pay to worship her feet occasionally. She made a fortune doing it. To each their own.
Get that coin girlie
She needs Alexis Rose to negotiate her rate!
They really aren’t making money the way they used to huh smh
this is genius tbh
I mean she’s probably not making much as an aspiring stand up comedian so good on her for having nice enough feet to sell pics.  If wide flipper type feet with bunions were in high demand I’d at least consider it myself
Gahhhh damn she’s so hott
I’d consider doing feet stuff but one of my foot is weird.
Sex Work is Work, If thats how she gets her coin more power to her
I used to sell feet pics on Twitter. Great money on the side. I should get back into it lol
She looks amazing in that photo wowza!!
Also… can’t anyone just Google feet pics and get millions of FREE images?
I respect the hustle
Get it, girl 🦶
Hilarious.
Good for her
april fools is over 😭
Interesting. I wasn't aware that this kind of thing even existed. I guess in this economy, you gotta do what you gotta do to make bank. No judgement here.
This makes me love her more. Go on girl. Get it.
![gif](giphy|7tR164I3rS9pXVcENb)
Katie's not the first reality tv person to have a go at OF.  I've heard there's a lot of Big Brother and Challenge alum who do it too
I’m sorry but this is a just a really sad indicator that it’s no longer worth the scrutiny, investment and time to be on the Bachelor. Pretty girls can sell feet pics for money without it.
nah, I’m sorry, but as a former bachelorette, you should not have to do this to make money. yeesh.
coming from a girl who has many SW friends; toe pics are typically just a gateway. by the end of the month i definitely doubt feet is the only thing she’ll be selling
Chad Johnson has an OF too
![gif](giphy|WrfTQS5HJ6mwC5NcZl|downsized)
Everyone here seems to think that this is amazing and empowering. It's not. It's sad that people have to do this. It's not glamorous. Interacting with creeps online who objectify you is not healty or fun. I think people need to stop glorifying this kind of work. I really like Katie, but this is degrading. People seem to forget you have to interact with your customers on OF.
You gotta respect it
Anyone got a pic of her feet? I wanna know what's on the market these days.
I wonder if this will affect her sponsorships?
![gif](giphy|kZD8cN1MycfKw)
And good for her!!!
Well I *dont* think catering to the male gaze and objectification of womens body’s so dudes can bust a nut is empowering or any sort of girl boss moment. I think this kind of stuff takes women straight backwards.
Katie could murder someone, and people would give her an attagirl at this point. But catch anyone else charging for their truly basic content, and they’d get rightfully mocked. The bias is not unnoticed.
Weird af flex but okay
[removed]
I feel like she should price it to allow her to get an actual pedicure out of it. Lol
Nah, I think it's priced appropriately. I can't imagine her current followers are willing to spend $100 on feet pics but I would bet that some of them are willing to throw $15 at it to be funny.
Big feet on women do really well.
Me too but you know someone out there would be willing to pay for ours
Im sure theres a market for it.  Make dat $$$$
Right? Me trying to figure out how to do this myself.  ![gif](giphy|l2SpZkQ0XT1XtKus0)
The amount of times I’ve considered this since my masters degree isn’t helping in this economy 🤣
Same. I’m not a foot person but if people wanted to pay me 14.99 to look at them, just tell me where to email the pics.
Absolutely
$15.99 is too low. I would for the cost of a mani/pedi+ profit!
Not how it works. They would have to tip her a certain amount. Not necessarily 15.99
Maybe $15.99 is the basic, non customized option
Apparently, you can make bank selling feet photos. Lucky for her, she's already got a platform, which gives her good leverage.
![gif](giphy|tto9ax6TYcYslqXUxc)
Same!!! It seems like such easy money
If only ours were as in demand as a public figure. :(
Yeah, this is absolutely a better hustle for society than anything else you mentioned or implied.
Seriously!
When you sign up for only fans, you have to send a photo of yourself and your drivers license. She's got a check mark on her account. So signs are pointing to yes, it's real.
She posted a link to it in her IG Story, so yes.
Omg lol! My husband and I always say we’ll do an OF for his ass.
I have a theory that most foot fetishes are actually shame fetishes in disguise bc liking feet is so widely mocked as a fetish, so honestly, ugly feet might make some bank.  Edit: i can't spell fetish
Friend, there’s a fetish for ANYTHING.
I have hammer toe, curly toe, and some bunions! I’ll join the funky feet pic business
there are definitely people who specifically like ugly feet.
Didn't even know she had one. Does she show it all? What does she post?
“Sell my soles” made me actually L o l. But also, same
RIP this queen <3
the house that feet built
The avian flu has been devastating this year so the price of eggs has gone up pretty much everywhere (and no more free range bc the chickens need to be cooped up & quarantined 😭). Many millions of farmed birds had to be culled through VSD (cut off the air circulation and crank up the heat to roasting temps over hours until the birds finally, painfully die) bc the virus is so pathogenic and dangerous 🥺
So you're saying this is a good deal? 😂
I think she made $200 🤣🤣🤣
Lol me too! I went to wikifeet (a site I had never heard of) and found her listing. Her feet look similar to mine, perhaps I choose the wrong career path!
Yeah don’t feet people want to see feet and the body attached? What good is just a shot of a 🦶🏻
I have a super close friend who funded her way through college on feet pics only!!!
SWer?
Lol, Stephanie from 90 day fiance
I once had a roommate sell her worn panties.
Lol. And ew.
used to? Why would you stop?
I can't take credit. I found this on an Instagram bachelor account - not too sure who originally found it, though.
She’s so millennial I’m crying
Legit lol my first boyfriend called me dinosaur feet. Althoooough I’ve got finger toes I can pick things up with maybe there is a market!
There is probably a market for crusty feet, people are weird.
I think its more just like "if you wanna pay for my pedicure and a photo of my feet... why tf not?". It's less effort than a cameo and those have been popular for years.
Maybe if you advertise as only having one, there will be                   🌟mystery🌟
Totally agree, but I personally wouldn’t consider SFW feet pics as sex work.    By that definition, all modeling would be considered sec work.
Wow…I’m kind of shocked by this. Her ass looks great though.   Just surprised she would do this since she seems to think so high of herself
I mean, same could be said for naked people in general yet there's OnlyFans
Right,  I get the feeling this is just a joke.
First thing I did was check the date on the post.
It’s real. She said she’s going to use the money to pay off her mom’s house.
Yes it is real. She just shared the link in her Instagram stories.
90% of the 90 day fiancé franchise…
the barrier to entry to posting photos of your feet is literally the floor. It is not that easy to make money off of it if you don't have either a really good marketing gimmick you're investing time in, or you're already well-known and that's why people want to see your feet.
She's able to make significantly more money off of feet pics because of the bachelor.
I don't know, I would bet that the more fame or even notoriety you have, the less you have to interact and the more valuable your pictures alone would be.   As an aside 👏👏👏 for suggesting the decision to go on the Bachelor is purely financial.
She'll make more money doing this than a podcast
Oh man disagree I think it’s hilarious. And she’s probably doing it for her comedy career, I bet this comes up in a bit later.
She paying off her mom’s mortgage with these funds she said. Considering she and her family were incredibly poor and almost homeless at times, I respect her for wanting to help her mom.
why not? Labor is labor, and this way of making money hurts literally no one.
She doesn't have to, she wants to.
this is 100x less demeaning than being on the damn show
I mean other Bachelorettes are shilling vitamins, makeup, fast fashion, alcohol, etc etc etc. What’s the difference?
While I would personally have my hangups, the return on feet pics for the amount of effort it takes seems amazing and also it’s just feet? I’ve contemplated whether I would do this lol
She could probably just have it up for two weeks, get a bunch of media attention, make bank and then stop.   Maybe this kind of thing has a lot of return customers, I dunno.
This exactly. Non SWers can joke all they want about selling feet pics until they get hit with the realities of the industry 🙄
What is SW?
Katie is an adult and can make that decision for herself. She doesn't "have" to do anything on OF. I understand your perspective, but that's your opinion. Clearly she doesn't feel the same. This take feels white-knight-ish to me.
Interacting with creeps at a bar or restaurant or even a nursing home is also not empowering, but it's a job. Men will always objectify women. Might as well make money from it, if you're not uncomfortable. Plus, she might like the attention.
I think in our society we naturally have a lot of difficulty treading the thin line between casting judgment and criticism versus glorifying and uplifting.  There has been a very open battle for the rights of sex workers in recent years because we need to stop seeing them as less human than us. This is important because their basic rights are being stripped away from them in the workplace, they’re often abused and it is harder for them to find justice for those crimes because of their social standing.  They have garnered support and this support breeds adoration, glorification, even fame. As a result, it also begets role models. Role models that inadvertently encourage others to jump in the same pool they did. I’ve seen some interesting interviews with veterans of OF where they all strongly caution people, especially young people from signing up and thinking this is an easy job on your mind or body. The glorification comes from us, the non-sex workers who try to support, more so than the sex workers themselves.  As a minority group being wronged, they deserve our support. We need not, however, throw all caution to the wind. It is well researched that this line of work affects the mental health of the worker. It’s good to keep in mind that we don’t know whether the bigger impact is from the work itself or the societal shame, which you are contributing to in your post. We also don’t know very well the difference in impact between in-person sex work, sex work online with partners and sex work by yourself online. We can tread carefully regardless and not encourage the next generation to make money this way, because we know the risks.  That’s a long winded way to say I agree, this is not empowering. I support Katie’s right to do as she wishes with her body and her content. I won’t call it degrading or shame her for it. However, it is likely not at all glamorous or healthy or fun, as you’ve stated. I hope she gets what she wants out of it and doesn’t run over her own emotions while doing it. Most strongly, I hope all the young women that watch the show and see their star our there “selling harmless feet pics for $$$” don’t get tempted to jump on the same train because the likelihood they’ll regret is later is quite high.
Hard disagree. You don’t HAVE to do anything in terms of interaction if you don’t want to. Also it’s a 2 way street. She sees an income opportunity and she’s willing to deal with the clients associated with it. No one’s forcing her to do it   If I could make a few hundred bucks a month selling pictures of my feet sign me up
Guess what?  MOST JOBS ARE DEGRADING AND SOUL SUCKING. SEX WORK IS WORK.
So you've never worked in a restaurant?
Yeah it’s thursty
Yeah, I’ve known a couple of people who did this sort of thing (mostly MyFreeCams back in the day), and one of them described it as “soul-sucking” putting on the facade, humoring creepy messages, dealing with internet stalkers, etc. It was good money for short and flexible hours, but there’s definitely a lot of baggage that comes with it too; that line of work isn’t for everyone.
I agree with you
I agree!

I mean she's shilled sex toys before lol
smart woman makes money off stupid men, thats the definition of girlboss
I agree. I see the argument “if you can make money off of it, why not?”, and I just don’t think that’s a valid argument for me personally. I don’t think sex work should be shamed, but it certainly shouldn’t be glorified.   I always try to keep an open mind and understand that everyone is different, but the idea of selling a part of myself for someone’s sexual pleasure is just so out of the realm of possibility for me. It’s hard for me to accept and understand why it’s normalized and sometimes straight up promoted in some circles.
I can’t believe you got downvoted for this?
I mean, she was obliterated on this sub for a year straight, so I think she's earned a positive thread or 2 haha
Oh you’d prefer we go back to pile-on after pile-on? I’d rather this. You act like it’s always been this way. It definitely has not.
If you’re good at something, never do it for free. I’m all for people using sites like only fans to make some cash.
Why?
She’s an adult and she seems to have a pretty good handle on self-awareness. I think she can do whatever she wants.
That's what I did in college lol
I once had a photo where I was barefoot  on a dating profile, and I happen to have size 12 feet. I very quickly realized how many men out there have a fetish for tall women with big feet and had to change the photo.
I’ve literally looked into it before, unfortunately you kinda have to have a following or somehow build one to make any significant amount of money :/
Currently in grad school and can’t say this hasn’t crossed my mind
Yeah if it's just like a random pic of my feet you can definitely have it for $15.99 lol
he must have a good booty!
I recently discovered that there's even such a thing as a sneezing fetish! Bless them!
I shouldn’t have worn heels for so long but in my defense, 2011-2015 was peak office girly high heel era
$20 a month for “sexy pictures” (no frontal nudity)
And yet, the nation’s biggest egg producer saw profits increase by over 700% (https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2023/03/29/countrys-largest-egg-producer-saw-profits-surge-718-amid-shortage/amp/)
thats heartbreaking 😭
there has never been a better time to stop eating chicken and eggs!
That’s so sad 😞
I swear some people get like $100 per pic. I was seriously considering starting a side gig at that price point 😂
😂
Sex worker
same! to a dude off craigslist lol
I think I read that she was hospitalized for overdoing it? It’s a bizarre story.
Because she had a (f)eart attack
She posted the link on her IG stories today!
There is a market for sex work and many sex workers will tell you feet pics on only fans are the gateway. Because they wanted to see if they showed this or that if they could make more and more  Nevertheless a recent bachelorette with that many followers taking this route shows these wannabe full time influencers in real trouble
She’s willing to do anything to stay relevant.
Most ppl on OF don’t make much money, but my guess is men are paying for what they perceive as content they have “ordered.”
It’s not…lmao  Good for her! Get that $$ girl
Whaaaat? She’s talked about getting 200k for one brand deal before. I’m surprised she’d need to do this. I wonder if she’s mostly doing it to have standup content or something.
Oh Lawd the side of the Internet I never want to see.
It literally is for the money and fame at this point. Why else does every contestant at least start influencing part-time?
I was just thinking, “Is she still doing comedy because this is exactly the type of shit that people would love to laugh at. The requests are bound to be mostly silly sounding from afar, but unique and interesting enough most audiences would love to laugh at it. And one good, repeat customer could be a great callback in a show.
I never said it hurt anyone- that wasn’t the point of my comment, lol.
Seriously. This is way more ethical than diet teas or whatever.
That this is a sexual thing. When you're on OF you have to interact with these creeps for them to keep sending you money. Not only is that a bit degrading, it's also dangerous because in som instances people xan become obsessed. Lotta stalking going on.
trust me, if it were that easy and breezy and low-effort, everyone would be doing it. but the kind of men you have to deal with on a regular basis…… it really just doesn’t seem ideal.
I’m a social worker and can confirm I advertise my therapeutic services with feet pics

Sex Work

Social Work
As a former bartender, I agree with this. Might as well make the situation work for her and if she’s comfortable doing it, I don’t think anyone should judge her for making her own personal choices
Thank you for you lengthy reply, it adds a lot of nuance to the debate and you formulate a lot of the things I was trying to say a lot better. English is not my first language and as I pointed out in another comment, maybe degrading is the wrong word. It's not out of any disrespect and more about how I personally would feel degraded doing it.   I don't have any disrespect towards sex workers. One of my best friends used to be a sex worker. Before she died of an overdose. She was very sex positive and always tried to make it sound glamorous, easy and lucrative (she was an escort so she made A LOT of money) but that life was tearing her apart and she had to do drugs to keep up the appearance (mostly to herself) that what she was doing was good work and worth it. And yeah, she died at 28.  You are right in that it's a balance. I wasn't trying to be disrespectful in my comment, more like put out a warning, but I see how it could be taken differently.   It's a very complicated issue with no clear solution in sight. Because of course when young, beautiful, famous people all do this it becomes normalised and even glorified. And I don't want to shame anyone either. So how do we thread the needle? I honestly don't know.
I know no one is forcing her, that would be a whole new level of creepy.   I knew a girl who sold her panties and she asked me if I was interested so we talked about it. It sounded so easy and lucrative so I considered it. Until she started telling me about obsessive fans, stalking and threats. For her it was just part of the deal, but I would never put myself in that unsafe situation. She interacted a lot with her followers to keep them (competitive market)   Katie says you get to pick her nail colour and which shoes she wears which will undoubtedly lead to creepy conversations with horny wierdos.
Sex work is work, of course.   But most jobs are not “degrading and soul sucking.” No matter what field you are in, if you truly feel your job / career is degrading and soul sucking for you on a regular basis, please try to find something else if possible.   No job is always easy or fun but no one should feel degraded or like their soul is being sucked at the end of the day.
Yeah when I was younger, why?
Lol
Sex toys and sex work are a little different
It’s just a job
It’s every thread for the past year and it’s overcorrecting. Especially considering how many times I get Reddit cares for pointing it out. If Kaitlyn, Becca, Michelle, Gabby, any other woman was charging for content (especially a WOC), the whole tone would 100% be different.   It’s embarrassing how much people love to make Katie a victim as if she wasn’t responsible for a fair bit of the criticism coming her way. I’m not asking people to hate her. I’m asking for space to be critical of her when it’s earned.
No I would prefer not to be downvoted or censored or sent Reddit cares for pointing out the (white woman) bias here lately. Not when people attacked Michelle for something way less cringey than this.
Whatever you say 🤷‍♂️. Nobody seems to understand the ripple effects of Shit like only fans. It’s all about what’s cool right now.
I don’t care what she does.. get that money, sis.
I'm looking at my home paint job with new eyes. My feet aren't too bad looking............
Genius
Yes! And stepping on men is a big thing. A giantess fetish
Yes I have definitely dated guys who said they always wished they could date a "tall" girl. No one has said anything about my feet yet.
Too bad. I have really nice feet… though the rest of me is questionable.
I never even knew I liked a man with a nice butt and then I met my husband 🤤🤤
Oh man. I could make so much money right now.
And I definitely shouldn’t have joined cross country! Ya live and ya learn
If you read the article, it’s because their hens didn’t get the virus. They didn’t have to cull so they kept selling to their regular distributors and to new ones (those needing to keep up with demand)
Right?? It’s absolutely despicable. Sort of like the oil and gas companies saw major windfall profits even as people couldn’t afford to heat their homes through winter.

❤️❤️❤️  Seeing the avian flu conditions is actually what woke me up to how chickens and egg-laying hens are normally treated by the industry. Disease and antibiotic resistance is always a concern because these animals are kept so confined and live on top of each other, often by the tens or hundreds of thousands, in their own urine and excrement, resulting in painful ammonia burns to their legs and bodies. It isn’t an exaggeration to say that they’re the most abused animal on the planet; over 99% of chickens are factory farmed and each year we raise and kill tens of billions of them. And even “free-range” is not much better for them, even if some birds manage to escape through the little doors they provide, the majority may never see the outside.   Because it’s more difficult for people to empathise with chickens, laws protecting them are next to nonexistent. In some places, they are allowed to be buried alive to be culled. By industry standard, male chicks in the egg industry are thrown in large blenders to be ground up fully conscious, or directly in garbage bags while still breathing because they can’t lay eggs and are too thin to become meat chickens.  As someone recently who ate chicken, I kid you not, every single day, these two videos below changed my life :) hoping that someone might see them and have their life changed too! The world could use more compassion for these poor beings  Broiler Chickens - https://youtu.be/H80Hz7x1I5M  Egg-Laying Hens - https://youtu.be/yrFu_vSdfzs  Sorry for typing so much I just feel like I didn’t know any of this and want to raise awareness!
🙌🏼
Feel free to eat bugs, I'm not interested.
Now you got me considering....🤑
Yeah she literally took on a fart-producing diet that was so intense that she was hospitalized with GI distress. I sabe story and her persona on reality tv is pretty shitty.
bizarre seems to be the word for it
So maybe it will end up going back to that you go on the show just for love, because there ain't any money in it anymore 😂
Guarantee people are still jerking it to Kendall’s SFW nail polish ads, exclusive content or not.  Doesn’t make it sex work.
Depends on whether you can build a fanbase or not
It’s also possible she has money coming but has equal amounts of money going out. A lot of people are big spenders.
Maybe. She doesn’t do many ads especially compared to other people with 500k+ followers so maybe she’s more interested in making income from this.
I found her page and it's $16 a subscriber. Not per pic. Also, I would assume that special requests are more $.
None of what you described is limited to OnlyFans and its creators. Influencers also have to interact with their followers and their followers can be weird. Their followers can become obsessed. I mean Clare had a stalker and had to move.
You don't HAVE to. Depends how many customers you  have.   You're also describing Instagram btw
“Degrading” is a social construct, and not one Katie cares about. Remember, she showed up on the first night of The Bachelor with a giant vibrator. This fits with her brand.  And she’s already a minor celebrity who has had to deal with tons of online haters and creeps. She’s well aware of the stalking risks, etc.
Do you sell photos online? Otherwise it’s tough to trust you
It’s harder if you have to build a following, but she’s already a minor celeb.
Sole for a $oul ™️
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻💯
I’m really very sorry for the loss of your friend. I totally get how this becomes a personal issue to many, especially those who know or knew someone in the business. The counts I’ve read from previous workers are a hard read, even when I don’t know them personally.  No worries about the language, English isn’t my first language either. I only meant to point out that we don’t need to swing to either end of the extremes, even if we would rather not encourage more women towards sex work.
I mean that’s totally understandable. I think if one is educated and informed of the conversations and potential risks you are opening yourself up to it shouldn’t be considered degrading   Katie especially knows how people can be in DMs and whatever and I’m sure she’s ready for it or has people managing it for her
I mean yeah, but going on national TV as a sex positive bachelorette also puts you in the position to have obsessive fans, stalking, and threats. I don't think it's super off brand for her, nor is she unaware of the consequences.
Wait. How much do panties go for???
Wait do you consider selling feet pics to be sex work? What about models who sell shoes and have pics of their feet taken? Is that sex work?   Genuinely asking because these comments have me surprised.
REGARDLESS most jobs do make people feel that way. YES MOST.   People don't really have the choices you might have. Especially people who go into sex work.   OR some people enjoy it. And if they enjoy it, they're not feeling degraded or soul-sucked.
That’s a first! Downloading for chuckling at a clever funny comment
Feet pics are the tamest form of sex work - it's not a big deal. Johnson and Johnson may not want her to advertise their baby formula but she was never their target demo anyway.
then stop pointing it out ya weirdo😂
Well, have you ever asked yourself why you keep pointing it out? Do you want Katie to continue receiving hate?
have you seen Taylor Nolan’s OF???
Okay, not everything is about race though.
How about not attack either 🤗
Ripple effects? Go on, I’m listening.
I say go for it  Not like someone can blackmail you with your foot pics lol
i already dont eat chicken or eggs so i cant watch those videos, dont wanna further traumatize myself or them! i just wonder whats the best way to for this to work for the pet food industry. even though i dont eat meat, i still buy a lot of chicken in the form of cat food, which makes me feel really guilty :/
Oh my god, this is so terrible. How do people do this to living creatures??!   I have been a vegetarian all my life but maybe this is my sign to stop consuming eggs and dairy products too.
Yes because eggs and bugs are the only things human — omnivores! — can eat apparently 🙄
Nature is healing
She’s making porn for dudes, that definitely qualifies as sex work
She does a decent amount of ads, they just aren’t for any impressive brands
Yeah I wouldn't want any of that. Why I don't really use other social media apart from reddit which is as anonymous as you want it to be. But OF is sexual in nature, so I can imagine the problems starting from the very beginning of the interactions.
this is not even a realistic comparison in the least bit, lmao
do you? if you don’t, then why not?
Maybe degrading wasn't the right word. English is not my first language. I don't respect her less or anything like that. But personally I'd find it very uncomfortable because I don't like being objectified and I hate horny creeps online lol.
🤣 I think she got about 400 dkk. I think thats about 50-60 dollars. But then you have to pay to buy new panties all the time.   Some of the stuff they wanted was really off putting. The dirtier, the better 🤢
Please reread this comment thread. I am responding to a separate comment that is related to sex work broadly and it does not relate directly to what Katie is up to on OF.  But to answer your question, I do think that any kind of activity on OF is at least sex work-adjacent because the perception/optics are that the work product is being sold for some kind of sexual purpose.  It is the same as asking whether actors engaging in love scenes are the same as porn stars, or whether the model wearing a bikini on the Nordstrom site is the same as someone selling “sexy” bikini photos on OF. The intent of what is being produced / the targeted clientele is different, thus the work is different in nature.  Optics, context, and perceived intent are very real. It is the same reason people will not blink if you wear a bikini on the beach but if you’re walking around in a bra and underwear (showing the same exact amount of skin) in a park or mall, you’re going to get some very different reactions.
Sorry, do you think making personalized kink porn is *not* sex work?
Not most, don't speak for everyone else.  Perhaps the only jobs YOU have ever had have been soul-sucking or degrading.  But many, *many* people love their jobs in a wide, vast variety of fields and industries.  And that includes people with limited opportunities.  Just because a job isn't a dream job, doesn't mean people feel their souls are being sucked or they're being degraded.  If that's how YOU feel, that's fine and you're entitled to that.  And yes, there are certainly some people who feel that way.  But "most" is an absurd statement, and definitely not correct.
I disagree that most jobs are soul sucking or degrading.   I make no judgment on sex work specifically since I have no idea what it’s like but regardless, my point stands that if you feel that way about your job—whatever your job might be—it’s time to start thinking about other options.
No, I want people to acknowledge their bias and ask themselves why. Did you see the tone of threads on Michelle compared to Katie? Did I miss Michelle earning it by being rude (oh I’m sorry - “real”) like Katie is pretty consistently?   I point it out because I don’t like the double standards. People can twist it, whatever, to continue this poor Katie BS running rampant. But it’s obvious what’s happening here and why. Misunderstanding me won’t change that.
You’re kind of making my point. She was trashed for it while Katie is getting the typical coddling/props. I don’t care how much people want to defend it. It’s telling on itself. 🤷🏻‍♀️
A criticism isn’t an attack. Unlike the trashing Michelle took for a website.
It’s not good for every woman to be able to sell herself online. Men start to view women as objects and women start to view men as payment. Sure that was already happening before but now it’s intensified.
Also a vegetarian with a cat. I think ultimately, we have to make peace with that because cats are carnivores and need to be fed another animal — whether that’s a rodent they kill themselves or chicken pate in a can.  On a broader scale, I think we need to petition for all animals, even those that will ultimately go to slaughter, to be treated humanely and killed in ways that are as painless and quick as possible.
And just because you personally perceive it as such doesn’t mean it is ❤️
By definition, feet pictures are not porn.    According to Oxford, porn is “printed or visual material containing the explicit description or display of sexual organs or activity, intended to stimulate erotic rather than aesthetic or emotional feelings.”  Are feet a sexual organ?
She’s not doing the same number of ads as other influencers with similar follower counts. She does maybe one a week.
Yeah, this IS OF! Haha. Yes it sounds way easier than you said, like she could post one pic at a time that reach however many people subscribed. And I'm sure to get special stuff she'll charge more. 10,000 pics would be wiiiiild lol.
I also am deeply uncomfortable with unsolicited attention, but some people are less affected by it emotionally. I don't know if I'd go so far as saying selling feet pics is empowering. But it is enterprising.
Ahh it’s all good! I just wanted to have the conversation to understand your perspective. I can’t imagine how difficult it would be to manage that type of situation
I know this is so far beyond the point but why was my first thought “what if this creep murders someone and then the dna of this random panty seller is found at the crime scene?” lmaooo
Interesting.  I disagree, but appreciate the thoughtful explanation!
You meet feet pictures? No, I don’t think pictures of feet are porn.    According to Oxford, porn is “printed or visual material containing the explicit description or display of sexual organs or activity, intended to stimulate erotic rather than aesthetic or emotional feelings.”  Are feet a sexual organ?
No I’ve had great jobs but you live in a fantasy world. Yes MOST. This has been researched:   https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/12/job-unhappiness-is-at-a-staggering-all-time-high-according-to-gallup.html  Maybe you shouldn’t speak for moms who feed their families by working at Walmart about their satisfaction
Go tell it to all of the moms and dads working blue collar factory jobs, working on factory farms outside in sweltering heat, working at Walmart, delivering your food, cleaning your hospitals, entering data all day, etc.  Some of your are really privileged.
I don't understand the Michelle comparison. This sub as a whole mostly loves Michelle and hates Katie. It seems like you really just want people to continue reacting negatively towards Katie.
This sub does not dislike Taylor Nolan because she's POC lol. They dislike her because she tweeted negative racist things about every minority group on the planet.
she was never trashed for it because there was never a post about her OF lol
haha that website WAS trash
Everything you mentioned would already be happening in some shape or form with or without OnlyFans. I actually applaud sites like OnlyFans sometimes since it's helping to destigmatize sex and sex work. It allows for men and women to create and market themselves as they see fit and potentially find an audience they can cater to safely from their own homes and environment. I would rather OnlyFans exist than the porn industry which routinely was taking at-risk men and women, putting them into unsafe environments, and tossing them into the trash once they were used up.
thank you for your response! it feels impossible though, i dont think the majority of people will ever care enough for that to pass. it feels hopeless. with the amount of people/pets/demand there is, it will never make financial sense to treat them humanely 😭 anyway back to pretending none of these problems exists 🙉 la la la la
The photos are created with the explicit intention of making a guy cum   > Pornography (often shortened to porn or porno) has been defined as sexual subject material "such as a picture, video, or text," that is primarily intended to assist sexual arousal
Yes they are to certain people in this kink, so it fully applies. These photos are “intended to stimulate erotic feelings.”
I can link you to about the last 5-10 threads on Michelle full of awful comments about her and the last 5-10 threads on Katie with heavy downvotes for anyone critical. But I know that won’t change anyone’s mind when it’s been blatant for months.   But again, not asking people to hate Katie or feel the way I do. I’m asking to be allowed space to be critical without getting heavily downvoted (aka censored) for having that opinion.
There was def posts about her OF and how she was leaving ig to take her content there
Yes there was (or it was discussed in some thread about her). I wouldn’t have known about anything she posts otherwise.
Well I guess bad is subjective, honestly. Depends on your standards for yourself and those in your life. If a broken family isn’t bad to you, if a lack of education and critical thinking isn’t bad to you… so be it. Just be careful where you use the “it would be happening anyway” logic. You can go pretty far with that.
Dude even legally, foot pics aren’t considered porn.  Child porn is illegal and will get you thrown in jail.  Think you’d go to jail for pics of children’s feet?  Spoiler alert:  you won’t.  Because the law doesn’t consider feet pics porn.
I don't understand why you want people to be rude to Katie in order to elevate Michelle. That seems kind of backwards. How about we just be nice and supportive to both? Because be honest with yourself, you would have been satisfied to see people railing on Katie here, and probably would have joined in.
Likewise, I could link about 100 threads hating on Katie and praising Michelle in the last 1-1.5yrs alone. Just because there’s been some positive ones about Katie lately and negative for Michelle doesn’t mean anything. Can we stop comparing these women? Can we stop pitting them against each other and insist it must mean something if one gets praise and the other doesn’t? Maybe it has to do with their own personal behavior that week and nothing else. Katie doesn’t always have to get hateful posts and it doesn’t always have to mean something.
Which threads? It sucks if people attacked Michelle, but going "well why can't SHE get hate instead?" is unproductive.   If it's about Michelle's turn to influencing getting heat (though I'm not sure what you're referring to) I would say you have to understand she was presented to us as a wholesome elementary teacher which won the audience over, so I'm not surprised if people rolled their eyes. Katie was the one who we were introduced to with a vibrator and a TikTok following based on crazy stories. The reaction is most likely different because this is on brand for Katie.   That sucks you're getting Reddit Cares (I got one the other day) but I now know you can block the account and also report the message to Reddit, and they can look into whatever coward sent it.
oh okay, I must have missed that
Love how you went from OnlyFans to a basic downfall of society situation. Gud jerb.
Bringing CSAM into a conversation about consensual adult pornography is so gross. Not sure how to respond after that so I’m done.
How about I be allowed to point out the gross double standard I have observed, and people who don’t like it can ignore my posts instead of (mis)analyzing my intent for an agenda? Or rather carry on with their downvoting and sending harassing Reddit cares to anyone who isn’t supporting every dumb thing Katie does? Lord knows the white women leads need the support.
But it does mean something. Pretending there isn’t a trend in this sub and franchise doesn’t just make it go away. People really need to start being more introspective about why less and less WOC feel comfortable posting here lately.
Except I didn’t say why can’t she get hate instead. I pointed out the double standard. The fact that people dig so deep to not acknowledge it and attribute intent to my posts is saying enough. Carry on. I’ve said what I had to.
Because your logic “it would be happening anyway” applies to literally everything. Gud derb :) More and more people use only fans. Including actual school teachers. Is that a good thing? No. It’s not a good thing for your children’s role models to be porn stars. Should teachers get paid more so that they don’t consider porn as a viable option when they’re teaching 13 year olds… yes! Porn leads to the degradation of families and relationships, thus the degradation of the society we live in. Yes, there’s nuance to everything and no it’s not Katie’s fault but at what point do you say, hey things are kind of out of control. And I can say it’s pathetic to sell feet pics online because it’s goofy as hell 🤷‍♂️
You can’t respond because you know you’re wrong and you’ve been making shit up this whole time.    Porn is a serious thing, and to call feet pics porn is disrespectful and invalidates the meaning of the word.
Sure, if there were constant posts about Michelle like there were about Katie then I would say there was absolutely a problem. Temporarily disagreeing with something Michelle is doing is okay. Michelle isn’t always going to be right and she can be called out for it. It doesn’t mean there’s a problem with Michelle or a trend. It just means Michelle, like everyone else in the world, isn’t immune to criticism, nor should she be.   Katie was torn down on post after post for well over a year simply for just breathing. There wasn’t a single thing that woman could do right. It’s okay if there’s a post every now and again that supports her. It has nothing to do with Michelle, it’s not a reflection of Michelle, it’s not pitting two women against each other, and it’s not supporting one while putting the other down. They are two *separate* individuals. They have nothing to do with each other. Trying to conflate positive posts about Katie with negative ones about Michelle makes zero sense.   At the end of the day, **no one** is immune to criticism and there is nothing wrong with positive posts supporting a woman in general, no matter *who* that woman is.

You need to add Hannah and Tyler at the Jake Owen concert

Also, damn Becca and Arie were a weird match?!! I’m hindsight him and Lauren always made the most sense! Their chemistry in that pic is evident!

look at what HB and TC had to wear in an effort to limit the sexual tension ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grin)
Peter and Victoria’s date(s) look like it’s from a harlequin romance
Emily. Jef. Marionettes.

As an aside I really do like The Bachelor Aesthetic. It's got a very high class romantic look that a lot of shows don't have. They get some really beautiful back drops
tbh that still of lauren and arie is hot
Seeing pictures of leads being lovey dovey with non-F1 is so wild years after their season. Like Arie and Kendall just looks so wrong to me now haha
Random but I love the height difference between Michelle & Matt
Why does photo 9 look like a romantic moment between Becca K and Pilot Pete 😂
Out of theme but I love that they went to my country (Chile) on Peters season! We as Chileans do not see our country in media that much! 🇨🇱❤️
Who is with Peter in picture 11?
chris reading desiree poetry is underrated af
6 is awkward (body language and face…yikes). 7 is hot and showed the chemistry I always knew they had (which is why I was shocked when he picked Becca who I never thought he was genuinely into).
Should be: what are some memorable stills that resemble the romcom aesthetic?   I hate the way I titled this post.
Why did they pick arie I still don’t get the appeal
Strictly out of context but mind the locations. This post is purely meant to focus on aesthetics of the people in the locations.  The photos from Victoria and Peter’s date in Chile looked incredible (relatively to other photos from this show) with their hair and jackets matching the horses.   Also I have such a bias for Cusco and Tuscany so some photos from Arie’s season just looked super dreamy to me. Shout out to Lake Tahoe and Fort Lauderdale too (my other two favorite locations from the show).   Matt James, Michelle, John Paul Jones, and Tyler just look like they walked out of a Hollywood film, so I had to include them.
This looks straight out of a Hallmark movie
No this one HURTS
That's a beautiful picture.
Who is this?
I still swoon over the lobster date.
Farmer Chris admitted it. Also Ben H and hell may freeze over probably before he would ever admit it. First to give a double ily and was truly torn, and I think he had mentally made the decision to stick with his choice no matter who and no matter what simply not to make things any more messy than it already was... also "perfect Ben" image
This took me out
I had successfully blocked this out of my memory thank u
I hope it’s showing you the full picture. The umbrella is the best part
She was honestly perfect! I hate how much they all mess with their faces
![gif](giphy|PhT4KE72Jgj0b7Dusx)
Tbh I think she just got older and lost weight maybe (?)

You think? The thought bubble above Chris' head on that screams,  "Why can't you be Becca?"
I fully believed they were each others lobster at that point 😭
I don't even like either of them anymore and that pic still gets me haha. What could have been!
It’s so pure
I got the ick but upvoted you cause you understood the assignment
How fitting! Haha

Let’s be real. Every Tyler scene was like a scene out of a romcom
the one of the picnic @ the garden
The light on that date ( I think later than this photo) was so perfect
Same 😞 When I was newly laid off from work during covid I was a religious watcher of the QC looking for any clues I could that Tannah was a thing
>”You want some tail?”  ![gif](giphy|ukCs48K1ROpWgNychp|downsized)
The lobster date still makes my cold heart feel something
wait who is this lol

God I want them to be together
That was honestly one of the most romantic moments in franchise history.
Exactly, that’s the word I was looking for! Thanks!
Peters bandaid 😂
Thank you for this - all of the ones of him and VF in ops slide show are from this date and all i can think about is how he got the "meat sweats"
I thought that was Kendall
That’s not Kendall. It’s Lauren
I thought the same thing. I don’t know who they are if not them.
Omg I love Chile! I thought this was Costa Rica. Makes so much more sense now. Thanks for the correction.
Looks like Alayah
Did you ever see Emily Maynard's season? He was very likable
![gif](giphy|2ppoYU9s6mvW8)
Tayshia and Zac
It’s Tayshia
It was so obvious Chris wanted Becca. I think he was just scared she was going to reject him
Nope . She’s had a lot of work done.
Looks like they're about to go convert some people.

I just meant esthetics wise with the whole country/Christianity vibe
They will forever be my Bachelor Nation OTP 😭
Thank you, thank you and now I’m sad 😂

Logan and Kate
Still can’t believe they’re not together
the bandaid was a paid actor 😂
What does meat sweats mean?
Omg you’re right. Her profile kinda looks like Kendall from a distance and that specific angle of her head I guess. It’s funny it looked so wrong to me then haha
Who is it? I was trying to figure it out too and thought it must’ve been Kendall cuz it doesn’t look like Lauren and Maquel had different hair and was slightly more curvy. It doesn’t look like Jenna or Annalyse to me either. I can’t think of any other blondes from that season
Lol it’s Peter with Alayah I think
Don’t worry! Glad to help!
Ah no I haven’t seen her season, I’ll go back and watch!
She was my first bachelorette, and I would randomly think about how Arie was doing years after (I dropped off the series and came back during Peter) didn't even know he was the bachelor  He was SO memorable and I LOVED him in Emily's season
https://preview.redd.it/d2p3594a4dsa1.jpeg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6423c086e70edf2b8563f863401d99a04c617c69
Ahh I see. True!
🙋‍♀️
Facts
nobody has ever fumbled like she did
I can — because as much as I loved them on the show & in their little love bubble, wanted Hannah to pick him desperately, & the Jed spoiler to be wrong, I’ve resigned myself to think they’d maybe last a year or two but would have eventually broken up.   Tyler was the best option out of ALL her men, but she got played & strung along by Guitar Man.   I could picture Tannah together, but not for forever.
I’m pretty sure it’s Lauren
Oh thank you. Wouldn’t have figured out that was Alayah.
It's definitely a top 5 Bachelorette season imo
She even vomited on the LCD with Jed on the boat. Lol! Everything in her being was screaming Noooooo!
I think they’re like the the right amount of opposite and similar. Their personality types that I’ve deduced after following them all these years (ESFP AND ISFJ) are a golden pair which means they would have had the highest of highs and the lowest of lows. I don’t care if they’re together but if they were, I think they would’ve gone the distance.
That’s interesting & really insightful. Hmm.   Hannah’s season was my first season to watch, & boy, did I fall under the Tyler spell. (I’m still there. Lol.)   I think Tyler & Hannah would have made it work for as long as they could, but I think eventually they would have run their course. That might just be me knowing the stats & statistics of this show & the pass/fail rate.  I know Tyler would have been loyal to her to a fault. I wish she trusted herself when it came to him & how truly enamored with her he was. But she was set on Jed & look what that got her.   We’ll never know. Hannah & Adam putting down roots in Nashville did break my heart a little — I always hold out a little sliver of hope that Tyler & Hannah will find their way back to each other. Crazier things have happened.
Yeah, we’ll never truly know.  Just wanted to point out what a big deal it is that she kept Tyler after sleeping with Peter and Jed because women generally tend to fall deeper in love with sex while men fall deeper in love with quality time. Says a lot about how she felt about him.   Her brain was telling her Jed and her heart was telling her Tyler. I’ve come to this conclusion after what I heard her say on the LoveToSeeIt podcast. Granted more time with both of them, she said her choice would’ve been completely different.
Yeah, I could tell after their FS date she was second-guessing everything because she said Tyler was so kind & it was the most respected & safe she had ever felt with a guy, & they didn’t even sleep together. She said when she was tempted to he would essentially just slow them down so she could stay true to her word, for her sake.   & in her ITM interview after you can see how emotional she was because it finally hit her that Tyler was the real deal & she did have feelings for *him.   I’ll always hate it that Luke’s last date messed her up so much she doubted herself & her actions.
Cotton purely because at least none of the others ended in stalking
Nothing is bigger mistake than Colton. I felt it before we knew everything and now even more so.
Colton -- I empathize that he had a lot to work through with his own identity, but stalking Cassie was not ok.
Colton 💯
Clare!! She was on paradise multiple times and to me it seemed clear she had some serious work to do on herself. Was not surprised at all when she immediately picked someone and refused to finish filming, she appeared to have serious attachment issues. Reminds me a lot of Annalise tbh
If not for Courtney Robertson, Ben F wasn’t necessary
![gif](giphy|0PDxSKLuYHgA6dL1HL|downsized)
Tbh, they’ve stopped letting anyone actually have a personality.  The conversations on all dates so bland and insipid… I feel like they need to correct course and really choose someone funny and show them to be that.
Gabby & Rachel. It was a painful painful season for me to watch. Neither of them seemed to be in the right mindset or have the maturity to be the lead to find love/marriage. Gabby contributed next to nothing to the season IMO and just said “yeah” over and over. And Rachel seemed like she was legit waking up every morning ready for a fight with her men. And then I push myself to not spoil and just keep watching and then had to watch Rachel & Tito’s ending? It was just all so bad.
 Rachel and Gabby. Honestly having them get heartbroken and then immediately turn around and become leads never sat right with me. Neither of them seemed remotely emotionally prepared to enter into that situation so soon. The guys that were picked for them were just a bunch of fuck boys. It was one of the worst seasons. And having them be co-leads with this weird power imbalance between them and the men was uncomfortable to watch.  Edit: spelling
What about Jake P? He was such a strange person and not a good choice for Bachelor at all.
Clare because she was the bachelorette for practically 10 minutes
Surprised nobody has said Ben F. I must be too old.
While I do like Katie, I think paradise would have been a better format for her than being lead. Clayton was a bizarre lead choice considering, like Katie, he was eliminated earlier on and we weren’t really connected to him as a person.
Clayton, Katie, Colton, Clare
Production style from Matt Jame’s season. THE MOST UNCOMFORTABLE SEASON EVER!!🌹  **disclaimer: this is a diss to PRODUCTION**  1. Matt should have never been the bachelor. We knew nothing about him and production never really bothered to tell us about him. Production pick someone we know or give us background.  2. The worst cast. Mean, vicious, girls. We’re they hot? Yes. But SO unlikeable, especially with how they treated Heather  3. The massage prank date. Production that was weird. There’s other ways to prank people without them being undressed   4. Victoria as a villain. I get she was playing a character, but it was cheap drama  5. Exploiting Matt Jame’s family. It was very uncomfortable. I felt like I was intruding. Shame on production   6. The world’s most uncomfortable ATF. It’s so weird from a viewer’s perspective because Matt James acted like he hated her and then they’re together next week. Also I want my show to fun and messy, not dark.   7. The baby farting TikTok hack. (Okay, this one was all Matt Jame’s)   Anyways, production SUCKED on Matt Jame’s season. **It’s not Matt Jame’s fault, it’s production.**
Gabby and Rachel. Their joint season was such a flop in my household. The idea of having two Bachelorettes at once was supposed to be interesting but it fell flat because neither imo had star quality.
Becca K and Katie T. All the 2022 leads - Clayton, Gabby W, and Rachel R - that whole year was a miss. And Bob and Jenn from the OG seasons.  And in a category all by himself and should never have been cast - Colton.
IMO (for various reasons) Clayshia’s season ushered in the death spiral of the show. Their season was very enjoyable with the drama and romance, but no lead or season after that was compelling. Covid made us root for their love stories very hard, and the novelty of that filming came off as cheesy, cute, and hilarious.   The show was already having issues before that but it got really dreadful after their season.
Clare was unambiguously a terrible lead but it worked well because we had the short insane drama of her brief season and then we got Tayshia. A whole season of Clare when she disliked everyone that wasn't Dale would have been a disaster. Also this doesn't make Clare a terrible person or anything, FWIW. I'm impressed she stood up to production.
Gabby and Katie. I think Katie did fine as lead tbh, but she would've been better off on Paradise. From Clayton's F4, I think it should've been Rachel (still would've been a disaster, but just only one).  As for men, probably Matt. He has Rachael, but they should've picked someone from Clayshia's szn.
Juan Pablo, Katie, and Clayton seemed like the most random picks and I feel like we felt it during their seasons.  The show doing double 'Ettes was insulting, except for bringing Tayshia in.  Admittedly I did not watch Zachs season cause it was another Bachelor that looks like Jesse, but I heard he did a great job.
Clare was entertaining for us, but a huge mistake from production’s perspective. There’s a reason they chose Andi over her after Juan Pablo’s season - they both had the right narrative coming off the show, but the lead needs to be a reliable partner to production first and foremost, which Andi was way more suited for than Clare. I don’t know why they changed their mind about her years later.   Speaking of, it’s also wild that they made Juan Pablo the lead based on vibes alone. Desiree’s season had multiple solid candidates, and Juan Pablo had hardly any screen time, but people thinking he was hot on Twitter somehow made him a good choice?
Rachel R, because she hadn’t recovered from the breakup with Clayton by the time her season started.   Clayton, because he barely got any screen time as a contestant, and wasn’t well versed on how the shoe works. He was chosen for being white and easy to manipulate.   Katie Thurston, because her main experience as a contestant was standing up to bullying in the house. That’s why I think she dedicated so much time to addressing Aaron’s “for the right reasons” union, rather than really getting to know the guys. If she did that, she would’ve had a better Final 4.   Clare, I think she realized doing the show during a pandemic was not a good idea, and partly  went along with the producer’s plan for her to leave early because she wanted to get back to her friends/family, most importantly her ill mom.   Colton Underwood, because he stalked his F1  Juan Pablo, because he likely wasn’t gonna find his partner on his season, due to cultural differences stemming from the lack of Latino contestants in his cast. Casting diverse contestants is just as important as casting a diverse lead. He seemed to be a guy that favored modesty and more old fashion social values.
Katie like this season could’ve been a tinder date between her and Blake and then Gabby/Rachel
Tbh the franchise would have been fine without most of them. The success of the show has little to do with who the lead is.
Colton & Matt
Katie Clayton
Can we acknowledge that if Colton was never bachelor a lot of the leads after him never would’ve happened 💀 he really is the problem.   Colton lead to Hannah B as lead (great season imo), which led to Peter and Matt’s seasons (via Tyler C). Matt’s led to Michelle’s which gave us Clayton’s. Clayton’s gave us Gabby and Rachel’s seasons which led to Zach’s.   I’m not familiar with all things bachelor well enough to connect any more dots but yea  Editing to add that Matt also led to Katie’s season. Very important to mention that one lol
I don’t think the franchise “needs” any leads except for maybe Trista since she started the show off as a success and Sean Lowe (only bachelor success — too early to tell on Zach and Kaity) .   People can have their faves and least faves but no one has been really vital to the shows success besides those mentioned
How much time do you have?
Michelle and Katie
Clayton, Katie, and Zach never interested me :/. Arie and Peter at least had some type of appeal in their own ways as leads, and they proved to be so entertaining. 🤣 Matt was a great pick but just not edited well. Plus, his initial sit down and conversation with Chris H in the first episode just kinda put a bad taste in my mouth to start the season like that. I was ultimately super disappointed in Matt’s season for various reasons.   I just wish they’d cast leads that people would legitimately go crazy over
Jen Schefft. It was a bad season and she legitimately hated being the Bachelorette the entire time. It was all so bad that production took several years off of Bachelorette seasons before bringing it back with DeAnna.
For bachelors:  Clayton shouldn’t have been a lead, Zac shouldn’t have been a lead - neither of them were particularly compelling during their seasons  Matt James didn’t go through the process, so I didn’t love that choice, even though I loved that they chose a person of color  Ben F was bleh
gabby and rachel
Everyone after Pilot Pete to Zach
Clare! She was cringe on tv in my opinion, but I love her on Instagram!!
Katie and Ben F
I honestly don’t agree on Katie because she wasn’t a good lead but her season produced a LOT of talk around the show and a lot of contestants that made it far and are still very popular whether you like them or not. Also a former contestant came back to win which was iconic (maybe I’m biased bc I love blake) and we got to watch Nick Viall see someone else do what he tried to do but failed. Overall many iconic moments even though she wasn’t great.   Becca on the other hand had one of the worst casts in history and had zero memorable moments. Not to mention she herself was so boring, that season brought nothing unique to the table.  It should’ve been either Rachel or Gabby or someone from a past season, not both of them. That season was a total flop and also had a terrible cast.
imo colton underwood’s season is single-handedly responsible for the the bachelor and bachelorette becoming the mess express that it did and it hasn’t recovered since. the jump the fence moment was a jump the shark moment for the entire show. the show did experience a jump in ratings and notoriety but lost any semblance that this show was for finding love. and also led to the show picking even messier leads like hannah brown and pilot peter.
Best to just ask this the other way around, lol
For me all of them were replaceable except the very first bachelor ever, the very first bachelorette ever and Rachel Lindsay since she was the first black lead. And maybe Sean Lowe can stay too since it seems they desperately need his success story to remind everyone that this can work lol
At the end of the day, it's really all about did they give us a good season. So even the worst choices for leads can still create a good show with the right producer "manipulation" and editing.    For example, Katie wasn't a great pick, (sorry, Katie), but the whole Greg breakup was torturous drama perfect for the show.   The only lead that I think was a true error was Matt simply because choosing from previous cast members seems to work better in terms of comfort on camera, etc.    I honestly can't remember a thing about his season and it hasn't been that long.   We're all going to have different affinities for different people so you can't please everyone. Some who I hated others loved and some who I loved others hated. It's up to the show producers to turn it into a good show.
Arie and Claire. Those two picks were SO odd.
Katie and Zach
Colton, Katie
Literally probably everyone since Peter
Katie.
Katie
I mean, the franchise would have been fine no matter who the lead IMO. I think the contestants usually carry the season, not the lead. Kaitlyn is the only lead in recent years I can think of who was genuinely entertaining to watch, and I think it would nit have been as good a season if Britt or someone else had beaten her out.
Katie and Clare
Katie
Rachel, Clayton, and Katie imo. I keep forgetting Katie was a Bachelorette lol
rachel r., michelle and katie…just that whole timeline is forgettable
TV wise, Zach and Clare are probably the worst choices ever.  Personality wise, Peter was NOT ready to be The Bachelor. The man would pick Hannah Brown and divorce with whoever he'd choose if he had the chance even if he married Madison or Hannah Ann.
You can make an argument for all of the post-Clayshia leads, but Katie and Clayton stand out for being out of their depth.
Everyone is saying Katie... but I actually think Michelle. It seemed like being the lead sapped the life out of her,  and I don't think she enjoyed the experience. Same with Rachel Recchia. I feel like the same would happen with Gabi from Zack's season if she were the lead.  I think certain kinds of strong, kind people internalize perceived rejection and get very hurt and in their heads as "lead" on this show, and I hurt for them watching.
Michelle’s season was incredibly boring. So was Desiree’s, aside from the very end with Brooks. Clare was a complete waste of time, idk what they were thinking choosing her.
Matt James is boring af and they shouldn’t have went outside of the franchise for bachelor.
Katie and Clare and Nick
Michelle, Katie Thurston and Rachel Recchia I think were all mistakes
I mean how much time do you have? I’ll just go the last 5 years. Most would have been better off (for themselves and for us, the viewing audience) if they had just been on BIP instead or better yet, left the franchise all together .  **Colton-** obviously reasons; he’s also a terrible person. Should have left the franchise.  **Clayton-** no reason besides racism that he was chosen and he completely crumbled under the weight of something he never should have been considered for  **Clare-** she had already been on like 4 other seasons (Bachelor, BIPx2, Winter Games). Should have called it a day and tried for love in the real world.   **Katie T-** complete mistake just like Clayton. Crumbled and overly produced her seasons which failed miserably and had like 3 people self eliminated. Would have been an amazing person on BIP but was miscast for the lead role…  **Gabby-** just like Katie, she should have been on BIP instead of the lead role. Terrible season that ended up being shared anyways   **Rachel R-** wasn’t healed from Clayton’s season. Being a co-lead was a terrible idea for her and her self esteem. Should have left the franchise and *maybe* done BIP years later   **Zach-** like Clayton, no reason he was chosen. Terrible choice and a terrible/clunky lead. The women were the only bright spot this season.
Obviously Colton. For many reasons. But also - I feel that some of the recent Bachelorettes (most notably Katie and Michelle) have been more invested in playing the role of Bachelorette than actually trying to find a partner (however ridiculous that may be in this format), and I find those seasons to be the most irritating.      I don't like Zach, necessarily, but I do believe his goal was to find a partner. Same for Rachel and Gabby (even if they both had awful taste). And Clayton went about it about as ass backwards as possible, but again, I think he was genuinely trying to find a partner first and foremost, and not trying to be the lead of a show.      If we're going in the way-back machine, I think Bob was a terrible Bachelor and would have been better suited to a spin-off, had they been around back then. And someone else mentioned but Jen Schefft hated the show and every minute she spent on it, and she never should have agreed to do it!
I am gonna get destroyed for this one but Becca.  I couldn’t get through her season I just thought she was so boring.
For bachelors, I was straight up bored through most of Colton’s, Matt’s, and Clayton’s seasons. For bachelorettes: desiree, Becca, Katie, Michelle, and gabby/Rachel were not entertaining to me. Not sure why this show has such a hold on me that I’ll sit through entire seasons that don’t interest me 😮‍💨
Clare
Omg so many of the more latest leads! Matt James was so wooden, awful pick. Katie, Michelle, Clayton, Gabby, Rachel (pilot)... all of them should never have been leads imo. Whoever is in charge of picking leads should be fired.
I’ve never seen more people rally together to want someone as Bachelor than Mike Johnson. He would’ve been a great bachelor over Pete.
Becca k. She's very bland..overly performative, and I'd rather have a diff host for happy hour. I had to unsubscribe. ..katie..clare...Zach ( I do like him but nothing monumental there)
I had watched every season since Juan Pablo. But after Katie’s season I had had enough. So personally, I’ve got to say Katie. She was not compelling nor charming in any sense (in my opinion). Finally started again with Zach, so he was decent for a clean slate start, but I’m hoping Charity really gets me into it again!
Clayton.
Gabby
Pilot Rachel
Colton for obvious reasons and then some. I personally never felt that Becca, Katie, Clayton, Rachel R., or Zach had lead-level charisma.
People are really dumb here man. I can't with y'all saying Katie or Peter lol. Even though you hate her you've got to admit Katie was one of the most polarizing leads they've had and that's exactly what gets people watching and talking. The back n forth disclosure about Greg's drama on SM was peak in Bachelor Nation.   Coming to Peter , That man was absolute menace which ultimately makes good TV.  Leads which were bland and forgettable were Cassie's ex, Becca ( Boring as FUCK ) idk maybe Zach?
Clare, Katie, Pilot Rachel, Zach, Matt, Clayton
clayton and zack got me to stop watching the show altogether so them lol
Rachel R never should have been the bachelorette. That was a big production push when most people at the time would have been fine with making it just Gabby   Arie was boring to me I’d be fine with not making him the lead
Clayton, Juan Pablo, Katie, Matt James, Rachel (Keep Gabby), Zach, Tayshia & Claire (both), and really wish Nick was never a lead bc we can never shake him but the season was okay.
I’ve seen every season since Sean’s (plus Trista) and could have gone forever without Juan Pablo, Colton, and Gabby and Rachel. Wasn’t a fan of Clayton’s season, but I don’t think that was him so much as what producers chose to push before hometowns and several of the ladies.
Juan Pablo
Also-- if any of the people listed here had NOT been leads, I feel certain that people would be posting things like "Rachel Recchia should have been the lead, the guys would have been falling all over each other to date her,  Gabby was a terrible choice." Ultimately, this show is terrible to its leads (lately, at least), and I think nobody knows how anyone will handle being a lead until they actually are.
Juan Pablo!!!!!!
Lorenzo
Nick Vial, Katie, Matt, Clare, Colton, Clayton
Katie.
Clayton is a common answer but his season was SUCH fun television lol, and I got my girl Susie.  Ette: Katie
I didn’t fully watch Clayton and Matt’s season so I’m not sure about them, but definitely Katie for me. It felt like ABC barely wanted her as ette. They gave her a really lackluster promo campaign, didn’t style her well at all, and introduced her as the vibrator girl. Like cmon, at least sell me on her if you want me to be invested!
Clayton, Matt James, Clare, Katie
I feel like someone shouldn’t have been a lead if nothing valuable came out of their season so I’d say-  Gabby Windey. Katie. Clayton.
I will never understand why they made Katie bachelorette. Didn’t like her on matt’s season and didn’t watch her season. So happy with that choice
Claire and Colton for obvious reasons.
Katie, Pilot Rachel, Claire, Colton, Clayton (although he did give us the rose ceremony from hell so kudos), Matt James
Becca was totally forgettable to me.
KATIE
I know some people will downvote me, but all the lead deserve the position, especially if you are formal contestants  because everyone deserves to be happy and they are lucky to be in that position because it's not easy. Maybe who has not been in contestants' position before and just came from nowhere, I can understand that if not everyone deserves opportunities in life no matter what, except the person rejects it themselves.
Ette: Gabby/Rachel, & Katie. I feel like their seasons just came & went, all did not last long with their F1.  Bach: Clayton. What a mess of a season when they could’ve easily picked someone else from Michelle’s season
The obvious choice for 'ette for me is Katie, as for Bachelor, Matt James.  ![gif](giphy|26tjZmRqyPj9jUd56|downsized)
I feel like the obvious answer here is Nick Viall.
Clare, Katie, Juan Pablo, Matt
Clare, Katie, Clayton, Matt, Gabby/Rachel.  I think basically anyone where they break up immediately after the show ends?  I know Matt is still together with Rachel, but that season was dull, and I was rooting for other people to get the Bachelor job rather than Matt.
love her but rachel r
They all waste my time 😂😂
Katie, Matt and Clayton
Honestly most of the recent bachelor/ette's could have been replaced.   Rachel  Clayton   I was happy about Katie being chosen but her season wasn't really that exciting  Matt James. The show didn't do him right, and I don't do social media so I had no connection to who he was and the show didn't help me know him. This isn't his fault. I also was out once I learned who he picked.   Older seasons: Ben Flahnik sucked. Ashley Hebert found a great guy, but I really just felt bad for her her entire season. They really didn't treat her well.
Katie hands down…. The men (aside from Greg ) weren’t really into her. The fans weren’t into her.  She was cringe to watch. Her unforgettable horrible aunt was super cringe. The only thing that season produced was Greg.
For the first question, most of them, I think. Since after Rachel's season, this show has not been picking the correct leads IMO - Arie (gross), Becca (boring), Colton (criminal), Hannah (unserious), Matt (unprepared), Katie (annoying), Michelle (boring), Clayton (unprepared), Gabchel (unserious), Zach (too prepared/boring). The only exceptions for me are Peter (internally chaotic), Clare (amazing, unintentional drama) and Tayshia (just lovely after the Clare stuff).   For the second question, I think the only season the franchise is whatever about is Katie's because production didn't really like her, it didn't yield a future lead, and the season itself didn't really have too much drama except the Greg bit.
Michelle - Very boring and the season really have nothing and there was no reason for it. Zach was boring & meh but the last few episodes were good, anyone else would've been better though. Also thought Katie was a bad pick.
The only bachelorettes that have annoyed me are Rachel R and Katie   The bachelors…. So many 😂😂  But all in all, everyone is basically fine and I usually find something to enjoy in the seasons… or I just mock it💀
So basically every season.
Arie 100%
Honestly shocked people didn’t use this post to go nuclear on Nick like this sub always does 😂
I know he was on BiP and is with Serene (I think they’re still together) but Brandon would have been such an amazing lead. I really think he was such a good guy and really enjoyed watching him fall in love with Serene. When Michelle turned him down, dude was CRUSHED like I’ve never seen on that show.  I also would have loved to see Nate from Gabby/Rachel’s season over Zach. I think Andrew from Katie’s season and Rodney from Michelle’s season are also really nice guys and would have been a good leads.
Colton, Zach, Matt, Rachel, Katie, Ari. And going back further, Brad Womack. Of course I watched and enjoyed all of their seasons, but generally didn't find any of them to be all that dynamic or interesting to watch. It's funny--I just watched THE TRAITORS and really enjoyed Ari on that, but not as the Bachelor at all.
KATIE!!!
Katie, Hannah B, Matt James (love him but didn’t show his personality enough) and Claire
Colton, Arie, Katie, Michelle, Rachel R.
Bachelor: C*lton, Juan Pablo, Matt, Clayton, and Zach Bachelorette: Michelle, Katie, Clare
I loved Gabby but not Rachel. However I think maybe Rachel would have done better if not paired with Gabby. I think Gabby’s presence, maturity, humor and wit just magnified any flaws that Rachel had.
Clare Crowley. Enough said.
Katie 100%. never watched her season and have had a hard time easily following a season since. Nothing against her, she was just a strange choice.
Clare, Michelle, Katie T, Colton (obv), Rachel
Michelle's season was monumental because it was the first POC couple, but otherwise I forget it happened.
Unpopular opinion, but Becca was the most boring lead of all time  I don’t think Hannah Brown should have been a lead  Rachel Recchia was unnecessary - Gabby was the better option and they didn’t need two
Gabby, Rachel, Michelle, and Katie
I wasn't a fan of farmer chris
Claire never should've been chosen. I do not understand that choice in the slightest.
Katie
Wish I could erase Peter's season from my memory.
I’m a Hannah B Stan but the rest of them I could do without honestly
Desiree
Becca and Arie
Juan Pablo, Chris Soules, Colton, Peter, Matt, Clayton… so tired of them elevating the lamest guys to “Americas most eligible bachelor.”  Clare, Katie, Rachel. Far less misses for the bachelorette.
Never should have been lead: Nick vial, Katie thurston, Claire crawley  Should have been lead: Andrew spencer,  Hannah G, Greg gripping, Tyler Cameron
The last 6 leads bc I haven’t been able to watch any episode without almost falling asleep but omg especially Zach 🥱
Matt James, Michelle, Clayton, Rachel R, Zach… so basically all the recent seasons
Clair - a bit emotionally unstable, literally didn’t finish show   Jaun Pablo - horrible person here to take advantage of women not find love or a wife  Clayton - didn’t really want a wife 😬
In no particular order   Katie  Matt   Clare   Clayton   Juan Pablo   Michelle
Gabby, Katie, DeAnna, Jen   Jesse, Travis, Lorenzo, Bob, BenF
Katie
Why is nobody here mentioning Peter? His season was absolutely insane!
Tayshia, Katie, Pilot Rachel (I don’t think they meant to give it to her but they had to after how it went down because it was meant to be Gabby), Jake Pavelka. Clayton, Zach, Jen Scheft who almost killed the bachelorette, the list goes on. It would be easier to name who was good at this job
Matt James Katie  Tayshia  Colton  Gabby/Rachel  Zach
Clayton, Becca K., Hannah B., Matt James, Zach, Michelle, Peter... they are not interesting and have no captivating qualities to get the audience involved, so we have to suspend our own imaginations and accept their boring, bland drivel and convince ourselves that we are interested because "it's the Bachelor(ette)!" This show used to be fantasy and aspirational.  P.S. Peter is a man child mama's boy and he is unattractive IMHO. I am so confused about how people think/thought he was hot. He lived with his parents during filming ffs.
Arie, Aly, Clayton, Zach
I think the comments speak for themselves. C*lton.
Gabby was hyped up and totally uninteresting to me. I would have preferred a solo Rachel Recchia season.
How can anyone say Clare. Her season was unexpected and great entertainment. No one could replace her and give us THAT.
**Katie**, Clare, Rachel (shouldve just been Gabby)  Colton, Clayton, Matt James, Zach
GABBY AND RACHEL.
The bar is in hell
The thing with Colton was that on BIP he seemed so lost and like he was having an identity crisis. That’s not a man you make the bachelor. It was so apparent. I know part of it was him playing things up the Tia to try to be the bachelor, but aside from that, it was so obvious that he had issues. I still get so mad seeing how that all played out!
I don’t really think there’s any reason to empathize with an abuser
Ok, but Clare imploding the format of the show was amazing to watch
In addition to paradise, she missed her jacuzzi appointment on Winter Games
Also charity, she is sweet but so bland. Probably not going to watch her season. Would’ve been stoked for Ariel or Gabi though.
That was my first season and I was so confused about why he became the bachelor bc he was so boring (now i realize almost all of them seem boring) - did you watch Ashley's season? Did he get some wild heartbreak edit?
I was surprised I didn’t see more Ben F on this list.  His entire season wasn’t needed.
Came here to say this ^^^^
“Rachel seemed like she was legit waking up every morning to fight her men” TRUE   Rachel and Gabi were not ready to be bachelorette. And most of their men just wanted to be iNfLuNcErS
Theirs was the first season in 4 years of watching live that I didn’t finish. Just zero fun, zero love stories.
I’m surprised so many people are saying gabby. Totally agree with Rachel not being emotionally mature for marriage but gabby I think could and should have carried her own season, she was very poised in her conversations and aside from her final guys (I blame casting) I think she made good decisions.
Yep I said this too he was awful
This is it
Lol he was so unprepared but sooo entertaining.
God I would have LOVED to see Katie shine in paradise!!!
I’m sorry but “Jame’s” 😂😂
Production clearly did not *°~do the work~°* that needed to be done behind the scenes before having their first black bachelor. It's especially crazy looking back on it knowing about Mike "black leads don't get ratings" Fleiss and that he was executive producer of the season. What the fuck
i feel like gabby did but got 1/2 the screentime to show it so they were both robbed in that sense
I think Gabby did but the men were really not a good match for her at all
I agree with all of these except Katie, because her season gave us Gregxit and John's letter to reddit  Eta: also the return of Blake
I CANNOT get over the degrading strip-dodgeball date. It was awful.
I’m so happy Clare found her happy ending. I’m not positive how she met her husband, but I’ve wondered if her being on the bachelorette somehow got her on that path. Like if she was at an event that put her in his circle etc. I would wager that yes it played a part as any event in one’s life gets you to the next place somehow and it’s all connected. If this is the case then I also totally agree with how the season played out and am happy she was lead :)
I wonder if a solo Rachel R season would have been less emotionally taxing for her since she wouldn’t have had to deal with flip flopping guys and would have probably also felt more secure by having more options to begin with. I do think she was always serious about finding a partner who would work in real life.
Funny, I think Gabby was the bearable one on the Gabby and Rachel season. Rachel was IMO the annoying  one the majority of the season
Juan Pablo is what happens when TPTB blindly follow loud stans. Because people were going crazy for the hot himbo single father based on limited screen time. If you’ve noticed, no matter how loud fans now get for The Bachelor, TPTB never cave and their choices are often out of left field. And I believe Juan Pablo is why. The last Bachelor lead people were really clamoring for was Ben Higgins and both fans and TPTB wanted him.
Fro what I understand Zach F4 turned it down. Brooks F3 was a no lol. Drew F2 idk actually but I see why they didn't go for him. Juan Pablo was popular and they caved.  In terms of Claire I think they didn't watch anyone from PP's season which is understandable so they looked back into the archives. I also think they wanted HB to do it again but she said no. So they pulled out Claire from the vault. Although Tia and Tayshia were avaliable so idk
Same with Zach and Kaity
Blame Arie. He broke up with Becca on TV, and she became lead, which introduced us to Colton.
It's our own little warped version of It's a Wonderful Life.
I mean HB didn't even make F4 and got ette anyways so it isn't impossible. And considering she got the first date of the season I imagine she was a producer fave. I think HB was a backup anyways cause Caelyn was questionable
I think Kaitlyn Bristowe, Rachel Lindsay, and Becca K in their own way really set up future seasons and other bachelor-centric media opportunities
omg yes! Jen hated being the bachelorette so much! It was so awkward to watch that season, there was nothing fun about it.
This was way before I started watching this show but even I know her as someone who shot down both her final two.
agreed. absolutely NO ONE wanted clayton as lead. it baffles me why they chose him.
i actually loved that they chose matt from “outside” of bachelor nation (aka tyler c adjacent) because he was definitely cast in clare’s season for that reason, unfortunately they edited his personality clean out of that whole season
Agree 100%
never forget clare was intentionally edited with out music and with long pauses which are usually cut out to make audiences hate her!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I’m adding Becca’s season to my list after this. I literally remember no one from that cast beyond her F1 and Blake H, and I wasn’t a fan of her then or now.
Completely agree with you and don’t know if I’ve seen it laid out so clearly in a way I could relate to before, so thank you! I know there are some that really liked Hannah and Peter’s seasons and think they are the best, but that’s so wild to me because I found them so unmemorable. I think the huge focus on drama rather than even thinking a romantic relationship might happen out of them made them that way to me. Zach didn’t make all the best choices but the way his season was presented really felt “back to basics” and I enjoyed that! I started watching in the Emily Maynard era though 🤷‍♀️ so might just be my preference.
I almost did it that way where I woudlve started off from Colton’s season because that’s when I was starting to get annoyed with the selections….and I would’ve asked for each season who do you think should’ve been lead instead.
Imagine having your entire identity boiled down to “because she was the first black lead”
Arie’s season was pretty good, IMO.
Oh man. I loved that these two were older and legitimately wanting to find spouses and have babies haha
This was my first thought. Love her so much but I don’t think she was the right move for lead.
This lol. Even ettes. The show is carried by the cast. The lease are too powerful they are basically onscreen producers. They really just exist to respond to whatever the cast is doing and then make decisions based off that. Occasionally leads do go route though see the Zach sex week thinkg lol
Interesting! You think Katie’s season is forgettable? I feel like Katie’s season was vey dramatic and much like Peter’s season, it keeps on giving. Don’t forget, without Katie, there would be no Greg, no 12 days of messy, and it would be unlikely that we’d be getting thirst traps from Blake.
Des?!! No way. Her season was extremely memorable:  * That Soulja Boy rap is one of the most iconic BN scenes.   * Her breakup with Brooks is probably the most dramatic breakup in the history of the franchise.   * Chris’s proposal was one of the most romantic.  * Viewers honestly were unsure how it was going to end. I think the spoilers were wrong.    * Des & Chris are one of the few successful couples.   * Just to watch her interactions with Brooks makes her season worthwhile.   * Didn’t she have this psycho brother who was so mean during the MTP dates?
All of these.
The thing is Matt ain’t the least bit boring, they just didn’t show any aspects of his personality on screen.
Yeah Michelle’s season bored me to death. I like her as a person but she just didn’t really keep me interested. Maybe she’s too level headed. Idk. It’s kinda sad that she left teaching though
Matt’s season had so many great potential bachelorettes we could have had instead of Katie T. Bri, both Serena’s (would love to see an Asian bachelorette in the modern era,) and I even loved Sydney & Jessenia (although J is clearly BIP material.)
Who would you have wanted for lead from Clayton’s season, assuming Susie would have still been unavailable?
It’s interesting how Matt James is widely considered a poor choice, yet he’s actually remained with his final pick long term, and they’re a reasonably good match all things considered. You can’t say the same for the other recent Bachelors (Zach tbd).
Production edited out Matt's personality
I think Tia was supposed to be the lead before Becca got dumped by Arie
She’s the one, I think, who started that stupid ritual every date by running up on the guy into a jumping straddle.  Who does that on a date?
People just think Katie was racist for accepting the position (while ignoring the role of Mike Fleiss and production, which is such a performative joke). Katie definitely had a good season.
Agree with all these except Zach. From the options we had I think he was the best option. I do think he wanted to find love. Wish he wasn’t 26 so casting stops skewing so young but oh well.
I agree with you regarding Arie. The contestants carried his season.
I agree. Rachel R was too heartbroken to be ette
Been watching since Sean too! I said we could have done without every bachelor since except I liked Nick, Ben & Ari.
Came to find this comment. Juan fucking Pablo.
Ooh strongly disagree actually! He WAS a terrible bachelor in the sense of being an asshole and not delivering what we expect from the show, but for me his season was also the first one that really made me start thinking critically about the premise - we actually had to ask ourselves things about the pressure of the proposal, the fast track "i love yous," whether or not these things are actually necessary for the show.
Her season was terrible and the clothes were soooo bad
Katie has provided this sub with a lot of entertainment
This. The weirdest casting decision
I wouldn’t put them in the same category.
Totally agree but I love them both so much lol Clare is another super bad choice to me, she couldn’t even finish half of a season and never gave anyone a chance other than Dale 😅
Wow I honestly forgot about his season
But his season gave us the icon Corinne and her nanny
Facts
I would say her F5 have all been pretty prominent in BN. And shootout to Aaron and Thomas
I think it's because there weren't really any viable alternatives that season. Robby, Luke Pell and Chase were all awful, James Taylor and Chad even worst. Maybe Derek could have done it I guess but Nick was the best option at the time.
I felt like he was the obvious answer here
I find him to be entertaining though and someone you sort of love to root against
Took me a second to figure out who Rodent is 😂
Wait you are talking about Rachel of Rachel &Gabby, not Rachel Lindsay, right?   But yeah totally agree about arie lol
Katie!!!!
agreed, i actually really like rachel but i think having her co-share a lead with gabby who’s just a little more dynamic was a mistake
the “be a katie” advertising?? whoever put her in that had it out for her
That’s the craziest part, it’s so unbelievably forgettable despite the unprecedented finale
You really mean it when you say “unpopular opinion.” I respect that.
Becca’s season itself may have been boring but to be fair she 100% deserved the lead after what Arie put her through. She’s also an all star in that she got engaged from each of the 3 shows (Ofc her and Thomas broke up on BIP initially but still got engaged from it)
I was surprised no one else was saying Becca, I’ve tried and failed multiple times to watch her season but was too bored
Guys Colton, Zach, Matt, and Clayton
His girls were so good though! It’s hard to separate
They wanted a season focused on romance, with older contestants   after people called Pilot Pete’s Bachelor run an overdramatic sausage fest, with contestants that were too young.
https://preview.redd.it/90bwhsjo6esa1.jpeg?width=1001&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=57e5b7597dee51cf5007e420c485e01b24524b84  I think if we’re saying who was a mistake we should offer who we would have preferred. Here’s a rough list for mine. Made me realize we had 3 bachelors from Andi’s season???? JP, Chris & Nick? I was a JP fan when he was selected, so it’s easy to say in hindsight who should not have gotten it… so maybe I’d keep him and replace Chris with nick. Then for nicks season I have no idea who I’d pick instead lol. Also couldn’t think of a single guy from Michelle’s season.
I definitely just forgot that Katie was ever ‘ette.
Out of curiousity could you elaborate on some of these older picks
Peter’s season was insane but it also generated so much discussion and interest. The Colton-Hannah-Peter period was legitimately good tv. People were interested.
Because his season produced massive fame.
But for so many good reasons it was insane.
I agree with all of these besides Peter. I actually like him and the whole living with his Parents thing was never something he intended to continue once he was with someone. I thought that was pretty obvious but truthfully, it’s not like he lived in Ohio or somewhere weird. He lived in a really nice house in California where the cost of living is super expensive and he’s a pilot who realistically, probably wasn’t home much anyway. I think it was wise, and I’m sure he probably saved a ton doing it. I don’t think having a supportive family is a bad thing, as someone who didn’t have that growing up I find it admirable.
I believe with Peter it is also a cultural thing.
Hannah Brown.
Okay Ali NOW is annoying, but Ali THEN in her converse and dress was perfection lol Ali chasing down rated r, Ali being serenaded by casey, her crying over Frank, her being with Roberto. That’s one of the top 5 seasons for entertainment imo
Ali is one of the best leads this show has had. Certainly better than the last few leads this show has had in Rachel/Gabby, Michelle, Katie, and Clare.
Why Aly?
There is if you actually care about rehabilitating people away from repeating bad behavior. Giving up on them does nothing but cause more harm.
Agreed, I loved watching Clare
Amazing to watch only bc we didn't have a full season of it. Watching that for 10 episodes would have been awful. It worked out amazingly though.
Iconic
Apparently she has a great sense of humor but we never got to see it.
lol her season has barely started filming
Kinda, he was her F2 and when she “rejected” him I remember it being sad. He said something like, good things don’t end unless they end badly. Which at the time I was 🥺🥺 but now I’m 🥴. And obviously she made the right choice. Was married to JP for several years and had kids.
He proposed to Ashley, got on one knee (even though she wanted to reject him sooner and he wouldn't listen) and she turned him down.
I don’t remember his storyline well, but I do remember being happy he was chosen. He wasn’t my first choice (I loved Ames) but still excited for his season!
Honestly Ben was so different as the bachelor than on Ashley’s season. He had a big goofball edit with Ashley and was very serious about her, they were a better fit than him and any of his final 3 IMO. Ben was not used to being the hot shot guy dating multiple women & having all the power and it SHOWED.  It went to his head and he was a dick on his season
The season definitely had some bad casting and I agree that Gabby for the most part carried herself really well. If she had been on her own with a better set of men, she probably would have had a great season.
He was just an absolute weirdo and had zero chemistry with the women and Chris H!
Probably less taxing but the guys they cast weren’t ever going to work out for her (or most people).
I heard she was annoying, but when I watched hometowns (skipped most of the szn besides that and night 1), she seemed like the better choser than Gabby. She had the better crop of men from what I saw.
I think they both would have been better off as solo leads, but Gabby wasn't ready and never seemed like she was going to find her match on the show from the beginning. She is/was still clearly in a place of feeling like she does not deserve to be loved, and that was hard to watch.  Granted, their crop of men also really sucked, so maybe she would have been better with a cast chosen just for her and not for both of them.
He’s also an example of leads who don’t make it to hometowns or later are usually not good choices. Not only can they not really empathize with their final contestants, but it means TPTB and the audience never had the chance to see how they acted once the relationships were more “serious.” If Juan Pablo had made it further, TPTB would have seen how incapable he was of expressing his emotions in the typical Bachelor way and having more serious conversations and it wouldn’t have been this big shock on his season.
True, we could keep going down the line but I just feel like Colton is an easy person to settle on (but I’m happy to also blame arie)
Totally agree on kaitlyn and Rachel but Becca honestly brought nothing to the show
It was so so so bad. Like none of the current seasons that people are complaining about compare to how bad Jen’s season was. She hated it. The contestants hated it. The viewers hated it. Production hated it. Literally no one enjoyed it and it almost resulted in the Bachelorette being permanently canceled.
Colton’s season was SUCH a turn off..
??? Girl what are you talking about. My entire post is about FIRSTS! Because the FIRSTS are the pioneers and without them there wouldn’t be a second, third, etc.
One of the last seasons I enjoyed, Becca’s season is when I kind of stopped watching religiously.
His season was good because the cast carried it. He, on the other hand, was boring lol
I loved Des’s season! I genuinely believed 3 of her F4 loved her and would have proposed.
This is all in the last two eps lol which I agree were very hectic. Most of her season was quite dull. The villain was boring and didn't honestly really do anything the guys just hated him. It peaked with that James drama and then got boring till the Brookes stuff
The Soulja Boy rap was iconic I do have to admit.
I always said Michelle had her shit together, which is why she was going to be a bad/boring lead. I hope they pick more psychos, I just watch the show for the drama.
I don’t know TBH. Maybe someone not from Clayton’s swaps. Or maybe Gabby or Rachel would have each been better leads if they did the season solo. I still stand by my assessment that Gabby should have done Paradise and that Rachel wasn’t ready. But I think the season would have been better if they had just picked one.
I feel like the problem with Matt James’ season was not Matt James. There was too much stupid drama with the women that took over and James himself was unprepared to handle being the lead because he’d never been on the other side of it.
"It's ok."
Not to mention she got the worst location of all the quarantine seasons!
I didn't.
I saw a thread here the other day where the majority of people were saying how weird it was she latched onto him so fast and he looked genuinely just weirded out by the whole thing and back then I didn't think that but now I do. Ick!
It’s so crazy because I just realized we had 3 bachelors from Andi’s season. JP, Chris Soules and nick. Do good guys not apply for the show? Does the show purposely cast duds? Are there just not nearly as many good men as women in the world in general? It’s always been so wild to me and glaringly apparent going through this exercise how much better the women are than the men in the franchise.
Hahaha I didn’t see that autocorrect. I have to fix it. He’s too nice for me to call him rodent.
Ah, yes—Rachel R! Love Rachel Lindsay.
fr hannah b’s season had me gasping
Haha I know most people loved her, but I thought she was so vanilla… and she came from such an interesting season
Melissa and Hannah Ann both went through essentially the same thing as Becca, and both of them were far more interesting than Becca, IMO. So I’m not sure the Arie break up was a compelling reason to make her bachelorette. I would have preferred Kendall or Tia.   She also had only been engaged once when she was chosen as bachelorette, which isn’t super out of the ordinary.
Okay but she's annoying af lol
Juan Pablo was on Des's season, andi was on Juan Pablo season
Hehe 🫢 yeah hers was ALMOST like Peter’s because it didn’t seem to end for a while since after she dated a week 2 elimination after breaking off her engagement then got dumped 🙊
Jesse came on to advance his broadcasting career. He had no intention of anything serious with his 23yo law school student pick. Travis also was looking to advance his career; he lasted about 2 weeks with a women who actually lived in his neighborhood. Bob just wanted to have sex with everyone - he slept with like 5 women! Ben F just wanted to expand his wine business. He had zero interest in Courtney once the cameras stopped rolling. Lorenzo was just ridiculous.
That’s true. It definitely felt raw in a sense. Crazy how it went from that to boring in Clayton and then Gabby and Rachel.
That’s how I feel about Hannah’s season except I think she actually wanted to find love. Idk what Peter wanted, just attention perhaps
To each his own - sincerely. I pointed that out mostly because of the way Barb coddled him (seemingly). The whole "mama's boy" trope to me screams enabler of immature and boyish behavior and that is a HUGE turnoff for me - once again, personally. He seems like he has Peter Pan syndrome and can always run to mama when things don't pan out - I'm probably projecting. As I said, this is an opinion and bears no weight, but I would never date someone like him (having been both a flight attendant and having lived with a mama's boy brother lol).
Ali’s season is the benchmark honestly. Drama, love, strong lead and didn’t take shit, Frank left, Rated R, Weatherman. Iconic
Her desperation to be relevant with oversharing and pimping out her kids on social media. Loop promotions irritates me. I disliked her on Jake’s season. I think there were other options they could’ve gone with that would’ve been better from his season.
I’m all for rehabilitation! His track record is pretty bad though. Tracking an ex’s car, stalking her and showing little remorse. Now his whole conservative schtik?? The guy is a conservative gay advocate. He is a representative for Turning Point USA. There’s a lot more here than just bad behavior
That's very true, and that's what made Clare perfect. It sucks when leads make it obvious from early on to the contestants or viewers who they will pick, but they still drag out the whole season. Clare's conviction and willingness to stand up against production saved us from a snoozefest
God I hope we get to eventually, because otherwise it’s a snooze fest
Okay that’s good intel I will give it a chance. Her edit focused on her being nice lol
Yeah I was about to say she let him get down on a knee and fully propose and had a dramatic break up and that was the only interesting thing he ever did on that season lmao
I get you lol. We all know it's Brad Womack's fault at the end of the day ;)
She got an A+ victimization edit into bachelorette and then went on to become a big personality on their podcasts and generally came back a lot as an alumna. But I might be biased because I just really like her lol
Honestly, as someone who works in TV (albeit I work in scripted), they should have scrapped it early on when they realized she was actively sabotaging it, recast her with another lead, recast some of the men and started over. They could have even come up with some dumb reason as to why, although back then (in 2005!)  there was no social media and it could have been quietly changed.      But given they went through with the whole thing, I do think it was the right choice to let some time pass after her season because it was godawful.
I think his was the last season before people went on to be influencers.
Any season where the lead ends up marrying the F1 (or F2) automatically becomes a worthwhile season! There are so few examples of the process actually working.
Right lol. Plus they had two bachelorettes that year right? Didn’t her season start shortly after Katie’s ended? We are all burnt out with the franchise that year
*shudder*
My claim to fame is being blocked on his Twitter for calling him out on homophobic remarks. He’s such a loser.
I agree but she gave us Greg Grippo
I think the height restriction definitely means some shorter guys don't bother applying or get veto'd by TPTB. I think a lot of higher quality guys aren't interested in doing the show, and I think a lot of guys who are interested in getting married in their 20s...are already married or getting married! But yes there's probably not as many good men as women to go around too.
>It’s so crazy because I just realized we had 3 bachelors from Andi’s season. JP, Chris Soules and nick.   Technically, Andi was from Juan Pablo's season. JP had Andi and Clare go on to be Bachelorettes. Kaitlyn had Ben and Nick become Bachelors. Colton had Hannah and Tayshia.  Edit: forgot to mention the more recent Matt having Michelle and Katie, and Clayton having Gabby and Rachel!
I liked Hannah’s season, but I didn’t think she made sense as a bachelorette. We didn’t see anything from her on Colton’s season that suggested she was a fan favorite. She also finished behind Hannah G, Tayshia, and Caelynn, who all seemed like more obvious choices. (Maybe not Caelynn, since she was caught talking about becoming bachelorette, but the other two, definitely.) Hannah B, on Colton’s season, was nervous and jittery and tough to listen to - their first one on one was painful.
To be fair I think they asked Melissa and she turned it down for DWTS but yeah agree, she was not the most interesting
Aaaah that makes sense. I just had the distinct memory of Andi after her overnight with him.
I think Peter wanted to find love but struggled with how much he liked/was attracted to multiple women.
Yeah I get it. I think it sometimes can enable it but I guess I just leaned more towards the side of I genuinely think that Hannah really hurt Peter. Peter seems really close to his family but I wouldn’t necessarily call it toxic before he went on the show. Like his whole family are pilots lol they seem super supportive of each other and I just think Peter really admires his parents relationship so I think he blindly trusted Hannah thinking she was taking the experience serious and I think she was just super immature.   Given how close he is, I could see that his mom could have picked up on him being hurt and trying to help support him and make him feel loved. Which I think any good mom would do. I think it was more of the confusion and trying to love someone new while Hannah kept coming back in his life and confusing him that was causing him to have trust issues that made it hard for him to move forward. I just think Barb ended up looking bad as a result of not knowing the full details and trying to not allow him to make the wrong choice so it was hard for him to believe in himself without having the decision feel so heavy.   I know he hurt those woman, but honestly I blame the producers for allowing HB to go back on his season after she clearly tried to go after Tyler because I feel like Peter’s energy just completely shifted not only when she was there but also the second time she showed up. Like even the girls were irritated (rightfully so) because it wasn’t supposed to be about her and it did change Peter’s mood because he went from excited for the chance to get to know his woman to basically forgetting his own worth
Don't forget "Guard-and-protect-your-heart" Casey with his tattoo and song on the side of the mountain. Best cringe moment.
Agree
In terms of her position in BN yeah but in terms of her actual season it was quite forgettable and between two better ette seasons
Nah, Chris Soules' season was the first season of influencers. Arie just got lucky that the girl he ultimately ended up with was actually in the minority that was there to be a wife
Paradise was in-between
For anyone curious, out of 26 bachelors, only 4 have been under 6 foot - 2 that were 5’11 and 2 that were 5’10.  The average height of all bachelors is just under 6’2 (if my math is right), while the average height of a man in the USA in 5’9”.
It was clear she was way too immature and controlling to be the lead. I think she liked the idea of being “popular” but I didn’t buy into her “Jesus still loves me” attitude. She seems like the type of girl who just wants to be the one chosen but only because it makes her feel better than the other options.   I’ll never forget the 2nd hand embarrassment of the The toast she did for Colton because it was so cringe
Oh that’s an interesting fact! I did not know that! She would have been fun to watch
Still find it interesting that they passed over Hannah Ann
How could I forget Omg
Arie and Lauren are influencers. They just use their marriage as a brand
Oh, for sure! But I do think Lauren also went on the show with the intention of marrying Arie should it end up that way. I don't think their marriage is a sham
Y’all don’t be giving Natalie any ideas.
Madi Prewett and her husband, my favorite r/FundieSnarkUncensored crossover couple
Maddi and Trizzy trout ☠️
![gif](giphy|MEMUFbU0INx31RGF4f)  (She’s changed so much since her season. They all have, tbr. The spider lashes are long gone & this Madi doesn’t exist anymore.)
As funny and cringey as this can be when it happens, I would also like to simply offer reassurance to anyone who feels like they are struggling in their marriage or relationship. Marriages/relationships can absolutely be difficult. And just because they are, doesn't mean they are inherently wrong. They cause us to either self-confront and grow or self-delude and regress. That is a difficult and painful process; progress usually isn't linear. At the end of the day all you can do is focus on what you can control and remember to talk kindly to yourself and others.
Not enough caps, couldn’t be Juan Pablo
Is no one saying Madi Prew??
Honestly... Clare.
Its giving kaitlyn bristowe
I see the bachelor vibes, but to me this reads like a speech from Love is Blind: After the Altar
They read us (married straights) for real 😮‍💨
I feel like Kaity's Instagram post about the engagement reads like this.... not the "relationships are hard" part but rather the idealization of Zach. It bugs me.
r/boringdystopia
I saw this today too and it made me chuckle!
I saw this too but I can’t remember where and what it was about
i feel like the only person that thinks its okay for marriage to be hard work. like if youre traumatizing your children then no. i will say ive never been married but when i think about it i know it wont be easy. i think mutual respect is huge but it doesnt ensure everyday is going to be great. and people change through the years and go through hard shit and i wouldnt expect that to be easy but it would be how serious you took the commitment. im sure couples that have been together 30+ years that are still happy together would admit there were hard times. and i remember old people when i was younger always talking about the first bit being rough.
Elan Gale!
If she copypasta’d this I would be proud
They went through the lowest lows before they even announced their engagement . . .
I lost a whole Sunday morning to Paul and Morgan after going on that sub. Truly deranged people and lore
I’m a fan of the show and I’m not opposed to snark. But I swear I have learned so many details about these people against my will. I can’t believe most of it is even real. Some of it… I can’t unlearn.
She looks 15 here, I can’t believe she was on a show to get married 😭
Thanks for adding this piece. All I ever heard growing up was that relationships are work and compromise, so I actively avoided them because who wants that? It wasn’t until I inadvertently fell into a relationship that I understood that the stuff that makes the work worth it—the partnership and growth—are usually left unsaid.
LOL her IG captions are a lot. I'm happy for her but they make me giggle because they're so over the top.
*MEN* 👏 *LIKE* 👏 *THAT*
Lmao, damn. Too true.
That was my first thought Kaitlyn and Jason 😅
oof
Same. Whenever couples idealize/deiify one another and write long effusive posts, it always smells trouble in paradise.  Subconsciously you're making up for something (insecurity about the relationship, emotional distance, whatever). And I don't say this to shit on Kaity, I say it as someone who did the same in my past (very toxic and unstable) relationship. When your relationship is not stable, it's always on your mind, so you're constantly overcompensating, focusing on the positives, which comes out as incessant talk/posts about all the "good" in it. Your mind is trying to convince yourself (and others) it's great.  When you're truly happy, and feel loved, your mind is at peace - there's no problem to solve so you're not constantly ruminating about the relationship and subsequently overcompensating. You are secure. There's nothing to "prove" so you're not driven to write long effusive love letters telling everyone what a good catch you have. You don't care whether or not others think your partner is great becuase you already have that innate validation inside.  This isn't true for just secure couples but for anything in life really - if you find someone going on and on about their money, chances are they either don't have much or feel insecure they don't have enough; if you find someone going on and on about their disciplined habits, chances are they themselves are not that organized but aspire to be better; etc etc. It helps to understand this becuase you can quickly shuffle out all the noise of people's neuroses and not let it affect you.
Idealization? Y'all are really out here telling someone that you saw on an edited reality TV show that you know her fiance better than her? 😂
I think it was on r/Fauxmoi under a post about Chris Pratt
She looks so different now omg
No but I find is sus when people write all these overly flowery statements about their significant other. Its idealizing, no one on this earth is that awesome. I feel the same way about my friends that write a 2 page caption for their SO's birthday. I've been married for 10 years and I don't think I've ever written anything like that for my SO. It's strange. I actually liked Zach's caption better for that reason.   Anyway, that's exactly what this post is making fun of. People that feel the need to convince us that all is good.
Lmao that makes so much sense
I think it’s completely producer driven, and how much the lead negotiated before hand. I seriously doubt that the leads want to torture their F2s, and they would release them earlier, if they weren’t otherwise pressured by the producers.  1. Kaitlyn said she was essentially forced to bring Nick to the end.  2. RachelL said she negotiated beforehand to only have one guy at the end.   3. Arie said that having a dramatic break up with Becca on air, gave her a better chance of becoming the lead. So I wouldn’t be surprised if the producers use that argument to convince the leads to bring the F2 to the end. I wonder if they also tell the lead that a dramatic break up will more likely give their F2 first sand rights on BIP.
They kept emphasizing it as the first engagement since Peter. Production made sure they were gonna get their traditional “who’s getting out of the car first??” ending.  Like everyone is saying, it was probably negotiated beforehand. I truly don’t think it’s what Zach wanted or preferred but it was probably discussed before he developed serious feelings and he had to go along with it for the show.
If I were F2, I would want the lead to treat me badly  on screen so I can get sympathy from the audience and maybe followers. And if he told me privately, I would probably still ask him to do that lol
Other commenters have mentioned it, but I think people are dismissing how heavily producers influence the outcome. Zach literally told production it was Kaity after their LCD and production told him to be quiet and think about it more. Production at least on the bachelor REALLY wants to get to the last day for “drama”. Not that leads can’t fight back, but it’s also not 100% their choice
I think a lot of this is producer driven. They definitely get to know the F2 enough to know whether or not they’ll have a big ‘entertaining’ reaction to being dumped (for example, Brandon, Gabi and Blake H.), and if they will, they convince the lead that they need to wait until the last moment to maximize that reaction. For an F2 like Ben on Tayshia’s season, or like Michelle on Matt’s, they probably knew they’d be more low key in their reaction so they let the lead do it early.
I started crying when Hannah Brown let Tyler Cameron go through half his speech just to cut him off and tell him he’s not the one. I felt so bad for him and it was SUCH a sweet speech. It made me not really like Hannah in that moment at all
I think there are a couple key things at play here:   \- some leads understand they can buck production more than other leads and can argue for what they want. The best example is probably Andi Dorfman: powerful intelligent woman, called Juan Pablo on his BS on his season to get the bachelorette edit, dumped Nick before the FRC because it was right for her relationship with Josh and the right move. Kaitlyn was cut from a similar mold, but has said production WOULD NOT let her dump Nick pre-rose ceremony because that had JUST happened to him with Andi. Emily Maynard is another great example of this type of lead.  She eliminated Arie before the FRC.   \- some leads are more manipulable by production, so they get convinced it is the "right thing to do" for their F2.  Either because they are young, they are people pleasers, or just dont understand they walked into manipulation central.  (Examples of these type of lead would be Zach (young/people pleaser), and Clayton (not attuned before the show to the manipulation). I would put a lot of the female leads in this bucket, (Ashley, Desiree, Deanna), but they also got treated really cruelly by production and were probably just emotionally SPENT by the finale.   \- some leads are just really emotionally intelligent people who will push to do the right thing.  Or simply havent used up their social capital with production (they played along up to this point) and use their social capital to do the kind thing at this point.  Matt James and Ali Fedotowsky seem like this type.  Ali is smart, PR savvy, played along most of the season and used her SC at the end.  She comes off her season looking like "the good guy" by dumping Chris early (which is wild, because she was a total mean girl on Jake's season).  A piece of me wonders if she knew how things play out and look, so she saved her social capital to use at this point to look better in the eyes of the public.  Matt is just an emotionally intelligent person.  And I think he was attuned enough to the dickishness of production that  he pushed for the kind thing for Michelle.     \- and lastly I think some leads are just a bit clueless how cruel the FRC can be, and think 'its just how the show works". (Juan Pablo, Zach, Ben H, and yeah, I'd probably put Clayton in that bucket, though this didnt happen with him). I think this is WAY MORE likely when the lead is someone who didnt make it to the very end of their season.  Sometimes
If I were the lead, I would probably have a decision made by fantasy suites and tell the 2 who aren't it at that point. Then just let it play out however the producers want it to go, but at least no one is blindsided.  Ben handled it the worst of the worst. Slept with Caila, told Jojo he loved her, I mean seriously dude come on!
Obviously producers can’t physically force you to not go to someone’s room and break up with him, but they can do pretty much everything short of that. Zach has already said that when he told producers the day before the proposal that he wanted to propose to Kaity, they were very insistent that he should sleep on it and not make a rash decision. Clare has also said that leaving the show early wasn’t her choice. Production was frustrated with her and wanted her out.
They have to have some sort of incentive the longer they let the F2 stay
They are on a reality show.  Why should F2 be told privately?   It's the risk you take for the show and if being told ahead of time, the reaction would be inauthentic.  Not that this show is authentic, but...
I usually understand having to break up at the final rose ceremony, and think that’s kind of part of the risk you run when you go on the show. The reason I hated it so much with Zach was that every conversation with Gabi in the last few episodes was a really obvious chance to end it that he didn’t take. Gabi kept asking him to let her just go, basically, and instead he told her he was falling in love with her, didn’t regret sleeping with her, let her meet his family, etc. That felt way worse than a lot of the final episodes do, because they just kept having that conversation. It felt like she was saying “please just tell me if it’s not me” and he was saying “it’s not NOT you!” even when it was obvious to all of us, and, on some level, to Gabi.
Clare didn't ditch the show, they wanted to replace her with Tayshia. Clare has come out multiple times and said she wanted to finish the season and they pretty much forced her to leave early with Dale.   Leads and contestants may have their own free will but Blake was just sued and now owes the show $175,000 for breaking contract. Sparing the feelings of your f2 definitely isn't worth going through whatever retaliation producers will put forth
I think there is a financial incentive for the lead to get them to the proposal alter. Haven't seen it confirmed though.
Andi - went to Nick Viall prior to him walking down the aisle and getting down on one knee   Kaitlyn - allowed Nick Viall to walk down the aisle, do his speech and as he was about to drop down to one knee she then then said “no”  I think the leads have a choice. ABC would much rather them have their F2 walk down that aisle and be rejected. However, the leads can certainly tell them that’s not the way they want it handled. However, I think producers are very manipulative and have tricks up their sleeve to manipulate the lead to get the F2 to have to walk the aisle of heartbreak. Also, the lead may be intimidated by the show and do not want the bad editing. Is Zach didn’t do what ABC wanted, he may have gotten the really bad edit which may have casted Zach as this “Juan Pablo type”
It’s common for the Bachelorette to let the F2 go early.  But not on the Bachelor.  Matt is the only one (with a normal ending) to let his F2 go. This is a difference in the shows so based on history Gabi should have expected the F2 to be dumped at the FRC.  Not sure why she expected special treatment.   ETA:  Clare was fired let’s not confuse her with other leads actions
i’m sure producers do everything in their power to make sure the lead keeps both options around for as long as possible. whether that’s a monetary incentive, something they negotiate into contracts during certain seasons, or just playing mind games with them (“are you suree about kaity?? you and gabi had the most amazing connection on your last date”), idk. but obviously if the lead privately dumped the runner up every season it wouldn’t be nearly as dramatic.   TPTB might even convince the lead that keeping them around till the end is “kinder” because at least they’re “seeing the whole experience through” and “really giving them a full chance” or some BS.
Producer driven. It could be the lead being convinced that a televised heartbreak on screen is better for viewing and for the F2 to have a better redemption story. They have the entire season having us root for Gabi! So messed up for Gabi though!
Maybe unpopular opinion but I don't think less of leads bringing their F2 to the altar. It's brutal but it's the format of the show and pretty much everyone expects that as the default (although there are more gentle options sometimes).
Have someone else do it for me! 😂😂 jk I kid
When did you start watching? I think it’s helpful to contextualize your experience with the franchise and maybe you won’t get asked this twenty times lol
Agreed a lot is production driven.  They wanted a classic season this year, no way was Zach going to be able to let his F2 go early.  And he’s mentioned that a few times post season
first sand on BIP probably has a better success rate in relationships than the bachelor 💀😭
But what does that mean- “forced”? They don’t have a gun to your head. Clare acted completely erratically for the show and went off script from the start. You’re an adult with your own free will. Someone else has commented saying they believe they’re giving a financial incentive. I don’t know if that’s true or not, if it is it’s really sad. I just find it surprising if so many of the leads are happy to bow to what ABC requests even if goes strongly against their instincts and desire to protect people they care about (and even say that they love) as much as they can.
>“who’s getting out of the car first??”  I think they are sacrificing the potential of improving the show based solely on this. I think its kind of a trope that's kind of tired and they need to re-think.
Yeah I imagine it’s easy to agree to stuff when you’re just discussing a hypothetical role as the lead. Once you’re falling in love, having sex with people etc. all that would go out the window for some people, at least for me it would. Maybe they somehow try to screen for people who will keep a level of detachment and prioritize the show over the people they’re falling in love with.
Agreed lol, that’s probably the best case scenario for the F2. Also gives them a sad backstory heading into paradise.
Or have their mother tear you to shreds on After The Final Rose.
I got the impression early on (like everyone did!!) that Kaity was it. I think he knew relatively early and production noticed. They didn’t want another Clare situation so they kept pushing.   Not saying Zach didn’t do/say some messed up things along the way, but there were definitely other powers at play here and it was obvious.
And Kaity's date was filmed second, so not the order it was shown.
Oh my god, I still remember his reaction “this ain’t it.” 😭 I cried too, this is the only thing that makes me still want them to be together
I think Zach falls into the category of having little choice as it was clear they wanted a throw back season ala Sean’s.  They weren’t going to let him send his F1 home early.   I do agree leads don’t have as much say in the matter as much as many here think they do
Emily Maynard and Rachel Lindsay had the advantage of being leads which the show really wanted!! Emily supposedly negotiated all kinds of perks: high pay, pretend I don’t have sex, always show me looking glamorous, etc. Rachel negotiated that she would only have one guy at the end. Other leads are a dime a dozen, and just don’t have that kind of pull. For ex, Des was supposedly paid very little.
Love To See It had an interesting take - production is open to bachelor*ettes* dumping their F2's early and gently. They believe the audience (primarily cishet women) sees itself reflected in the bachelorette, so they connect more if she shows the kindness and grace they hope they'd have in her shoes; and in the bachelor's F2, so her heartbreak is a moment of catharsis.
It seemed obvious that Ben had made his choice pretty early on. It’s like Clayton clearly deciding he “loves Susie the most” but then he sleeps with the other two after telling them both that he loves them. 🤢
I don’t remember him saying he slept with Caila. But I don’t remember much about that season
tbh i think zach was worse, he slept with gabi, told her he loved her, and STILL chose kaity despite not doing any of those things with her💀
Clare forgot being The Bachelorette was also a job. Her job was to be open minded and date several men and give enough interesting scenes to actually present a TV show. She failed miserably in that job.
I mean Clare’s behavior, everything she did was outside of the script of how they want the lead to act. Clearly that was not a great match and she went way wayyyy off script, but when the leads go off script here and there it feels a lot more authentic to me.
I’ve wondered if there’s a monetary incentive to do things like stand there while the guy you’re going to reject proposes. I just don’t see why anyone would do that even if the producers told you to do it because it would make good TV.
I put privately in quotes because it’s obviously still being filmed and going to be on TV. I mean telling them at the hotel, before they spend the day feeling stressed out and then standing at the romantic proposal spot dressed up. For example, Andi let her F2 down before he had to come out there. Standing there and letting the guy propose before dumping him is also very weird.
Yeah I’m sure I’m feeling especially negative about the people who do the most brutal rejections after watching this season- Gabi seemed to have self esteem issues already and it was excruciating watching him string her along in agony for days and then dump her when she came out there holding on to a small hope that maybe her gut was wrong and they would get engaged. It seemed like his feelings for her changed after they slept together- like she said he wouldn’t make eye contact with her after the rose ceremony. She was clearly still gutted by the whole thing weeks later on after the final rose.
Clare is only saying that because Dale made her look a fool.
There was one time Nick alluded to something about ratings, and then kind of reeled it back in and said he, as lead, wanted good ratings. But the way he said it first was like, “Of course, as lead, you are motivated to have good ratings” in a way that there was an incentive, and then the way he took it back made my ears perk up. Because he didn’t seem intent on clarifying HE wanted it so much as “Of course we all just want our season to be watched,” or whatever.   This is nowhere near an accurate quoting. It was in early-ish seasons on his podcast. And he’s not the best, clearest or most easy to follow communicator. But his sharp turn was what caught me. Not what he said, but how he reversed course. Felt very protective. Not just clarifying.  I’m sure I’m saying it terribly. But I’ve been convinced since that the leads receive some sort of incentive based on ratings. And he’s more directly said that’s why he kept Corinne because he knew she was fun to watch/good TV. But the one time he said that. Idk, I was like, “ oh, it’s like how some actors/actresses get paid more based on how the movie does in the box office.”
I've always wondered if there is a secret bonus for getting "I love you" out of the contestants. It seems like the leads involuntarily smile and glow even when it's someone they don't like and then they quickly dump them thereafter.
I was wondering this! I just couldn’t understand why so many of them do this to their F2. That’s kind of awful though to imagine them accepting money to do something that may be more hurtful to a person they supposedly care a lot about.
I agree, however Juan Pablo was clearly terrible, they didn’t have to edit him that way. 😂I thought Clare and Andi both got pretty good edits despite not going with the script.
Didn’t Clayton do this too?
Or she just played it up? maybe driven by producers as well.
For Gabi I’d think there would already be plenty of public sympathy for her with first having the world told she had sex with him when she thought it would be private, and then being dumped. She described spending the day in agony waiting for the proposal/dumping, I just don’t see an ABC producer telling me to do that to her and agreeing to it after what she’d already been through. At least I sure hope I’d have more integrity than that.
I haven’t watched every single season, but I’ve seen most of them and started with Trista & Ryan. I honestly don’t remember exactly how every single one went down. I just remember seeing at least one lead letting their F2 down early in the day, and at least one lead stood there in silence while their F2 proposed to them and then dumped him. So it’s a pretty big range for handling this.
I assume they have at the very least contractual obligations; ie per their contract they essentially have to do what the producers say when it comes to the ending or TPTB can sue or withhold payment. And perhaps those that don’t agree beforehand don’t get the lead position. Yes a few leads have gone rogue: Brad 1.0, Juan Pablo and Clare. But they are few and far between. I’m guessing ppl who aren’t willing to go along with the format don’t become leads!!! For someone like Michelle who seems quite ethical and empathetic, to have Brandon go out there on the last day, TPTB must have a stranglehold on the leads, or at the very least an airtight contract!!
> Clare acted completely erratically for the show and went off script from the start  And they saw this as an opportunity for a unique twist, brought in Tayshia to quarantine, and arranged for her to get engaged to Dale early. She would not have been able to leave with Dale without their sanction, they would have worked to keep him away from her rather than encouraging it by sending him to her room multiple times on a group date. Almost nothing happens without the producers allowing it except maybe the fence jump.  Producers control everything on set. They control who talks to whom and when, they control any off-script rendez-vous outside of dates, they control whether you're allowed to change the format without breaching your contract. If you want to do things your way, you need to be willing to play ball with them on other things. Those contracts are intense and a lot more comprehensive than people imagine.
Seriously though!
I think they pick people easy to manipulate!
Or, when you’re third (fourth?) choice, have the same mother delete you on Instagram and pretend you don’t exist. I wonder if Zach would have had more ending options if his mom was a Barb.   Gotta bring some alt drama to the table, leads!
Yeah I agree with the Zach take. It was clear that they were pushing for a traditional season after years of the untraditional happening.
They may be forced to bring them to the rose ceremony, but no one can stop them from speaking first. If I wanted to eliminate before the ceremony and were fussed up about it, as soon as he or she is in front of me, I’d ask if I can speak first, and let them down. No one can stop that and once it’s out, the ability to edit is very, very fucked.   I suspect they didn’t like Andi letting Nick down early, but Andi was smart and direct. She would have found a way around it, and they knew it.
I sort of agree.  I’m not sure that he had much choice.   But it also seems clear from everything that has been said post-show that he wasn’t great at putting himself in the women’s shoes and thinking about what would be right for them.  And he was definitely not great at recognizing how much he was being manipulated by production or pushing back against them.  So yes, it MAY have been that he didn’t have a choice.  But it may also have been that he didn’t think to ask to dump Gabi early or push for that.
Absolutely.  I’d put Ashley Hebert in the same boat.  They wanted Emily but Brad picked her.  They wanted Chantal more than Ashley, but she connected with someone right after going home.   Emily and Rachel definitely had better contracts.
Wait… are you saying Emily slept with her guys even though it was edited to be like they all went their separate ways?
Reality Steve said the same thing recently on his pod
Yes, even some of the other women had said it was pretty clear Lauren would end up being his pick. So I don't understand why he let it get to the point of seriously hurting the other women, especially JoJo. He really made her think she was the one when he told her he loved her.
I don't think he ever said it specifically. But he called her a sex panther right before their fantasy suite date, and when she was eliminated the next day it was clear she was trying to ask him if he already knew before [they were intimate in some way]. It's not 100% but you can pretty much infer at a bare minimum they did something.
He never said “I love you” to Gabi. He said he was falling in love with her, had love for her, etc, which we know on this show isn’t the same thing. He also did tell Kaity he was falling in love her. It was shown in a preview and edited out of their LCD.
Clare didn’t go off script on her own though. She leaving with Dale early was very much encouraged by producers. They had Tayshia quarantining before she left early with Dale. It was just a new twist they wanted that season.
I think if you sign up for a show in which you aren't supposed to know if you are the final selection that the Bachelor/ette shouldn't give anyone prior warning.  I mean, what if the contestants were told before the rose ceremony that they won't be chosen?  Wouldn't that ruin the moment for the viewers?
I believe her because it's clear producers didn't like her and regretted their pick. They had Tayshia ready to take over basically from week 1. Plus she did have good connections with a couple other guys (Jason and Blake for example).   A lot of leads know who they are picking early on and it's super obvious (Nick, Jojo, Becca, Rachel R, etc) and they still saw their seasons through. Producers pushed Clare out because they wanted Tayshia.
That’s literally the show.  The lead has to lead people on, it’s their role.  If not JoJo would have just dated Jordan from week one on.  People know what they are signing up for when they go on the show.
No he dumped his F2 and F3 at once to run after his F1.  Which is why I said normal season where the F1 wasn’t running away
I was thinking about that, too.
Let’s be real about it though. They’re not in the “real world”. It’s easier to make the better decisions if you’re not constantly bombarded by cameras and people whispering in your ear.
That’s right, Brad went off script and was rewarded with a whole second season! 😂Even though he was boring and didn’t his own family say he had rage issues?  I just can’t personally see doing something hurtful to someone I care about because I’m worried about getting a payment. And in this case the leads know they’re going to make decent money as influencers anyway. As for getting sued by ABC, just call their bluff. Imagine ABC suing a teacher or hairdresser for going off script in an effort to be kind or because they fell in love? It would be a really bad look for them. If anyone would have been sued it would surely be Clare who must have broken every single clause in every contract that existed 😂
My point is that I don’t think ABC is going to sue a hairdresser or a teacher for going off script on a dating show. You’re still an adult and can make your own choices. Clare was saying Dale was her husband from day 1, they couldn’t have just forced her to like the other guys so they had to just let it happen and scramble to figure something out.
I think they need to re-conceive the format. The days between home visits to fantasy quits to proposal is very short.  I think they need to shorten the episodes when there's a big number of contestants, so they can spend more time when it gets to the top 5, and then stretch out even more time when it gets to top 3 or 2.  That way, the drama and the tendency to change their minds at the last minute is more believable.  Right now, it feels like they're doing eeny, meeny, miny, moe at the final 2, and that's also why the relationship-fail rate after the show is so high.
Yep! She supposedly was hooking up with Arie throughout the season. I believe Sean said she didn’t sleep with him, but that she had sex with Arie & Jef.
Clare called him her husband from day 1 and was using her time with other men to talk about Dale. The guys all picked up on it too and were feeling over it. Her behavior was unprecedented, I imagine they started scrambling for ideas as soon as she called him her husband that first night.
There have been plenty of times that the lead has sat someone down and told them it wasn’t going to work out before the rose ceremony because they don’t want to put the person through the rose ceremony. This is most likely to happen close to the end when strong feelings have developed. Personally as a viewer despite the terrible track record I like to imagine these people are really falling in love and forming a long lasting relationship. If the lead is very rigidly sticking to the script of the show instead of having moments of going off script, it feels a lot less authentic.
I think they had a backup bachelorette on the table very soon after Clare called Dale her husband on night one. That can’t be typical for a lead to do that immediately after meeting their suitors for the first time. The reason they wanted to replace her is because of this unorthodox behavior from her from the start.
People do not really understand what they're signing up for. Some don't watch the show. Plus you can't possibly know what emotions you'll feel.
We saw this scenario on Clare's season.
But plenty of leads go off script and let some people down before rose ceremonies or let their F2 down before they spend a full day agonizing over a proposal. Those seasons feel more natural and authentic in terms of the feelings that are developing than the seasons where the lead rigidly sticks to never dumping anyone outside of the confines of a rose ceremony.
Good point! I’ve been watching this for so long the seasons are all running together and I don’t remember specifics…
And that’s why you probably will never become a lead! Lol! Brad was a different era. The franchise has definitely changed in the type of person they are choosing as the lead. And ABC has indeed sued people who have gone off contract. There have been a couple of contestants who have been sued. There was recently a post here about Blake H being sued. Ultimately to be the lead, you have to be willing to lead people on, and to hurt their feelings for entertainment. That’s how the format works! And here we are as audience members supporting this behavior! Before throwing stones, maybe we should look at ourselves and say why do we continue to support this??
They absolutely will. They are very protective over their contracts and have sued people for breaching them. I'm an actor and my agents will flat-out not work with reality contracts for this exact reason. They are ridiculously complex and binding.  I don't think they scrambled at all. They saw an opportunity for TV gold and they took it. Clare has said that it wasn't her choice to leave early, and if they didn't think that would make for good television they would have found a way to prevent it and would have gone a different direction with the season instead of spending a bunch of money to bring in a new lead.
I used to think this, and it’s hard to say how honest the leads are being (as they have good reason to exaggerate), but MANY say they knew who the F1 was FAR before the end. Most people suspect Zach also knew, but is playing out the LCD story to not look like a dick.   If you stretch it out too much, you might have more Clares, because at some point you’d HAVE to preserve your IRL relationship post-show. And if they want a monogamous relationship, at some point human nature is to invest in that relationship and let the rest fall by the wayside.  And if they want to keep the tired format of two until the very end, and proposals, there will always have to be some play up of the “IDK who I’ll choose!”  I wish they’d open the format up entirely, and let each season become its own. Push some eliminations by X date, but allow more sooner, and don’t expect major milestones for X weeks. Rather, film, and turn your footage into those number of weeks of a show.   I’m also in the minority who hates rose ceremonies, and wishes a lead would handout breakups more authentically throughout interactions.   Maybe the roses aren’t given to everyone and are given out like first impression, but as many as the lead wants to give out. And maybe they could be used for something, like cash it in at a cocktail party for ten minutes of alone time that can’t be interrupted, or three roses can be cashed in for a 1:1. Or, wouldn’t it be awesome if five roses is a 2:1 date, and you pick the second person, forcing the lead’s hand!? <I want this level of drama and the contestants having more input in the season, as the power imbalance is unhealthy, IMO.  I’m also a huge proponent for audience interaction. We get to choose one date per season, or select a person to keep or eliminate. Or something like that.   Clearly, I want an overhaul. Not saying I’m right, but this format just doesn’t work. It was designed before social media and makes the lead look like a dick, and calls out producer manipulation way more.
I need more of this tea delivered please!! Where can I get more?!!
Bachelorettes not Bachelors.
I'm talking about when we, as viewers, watch the actual rose ceremony, I would not like it if the lead told the person standing there at the rose ceremony that he wasn't going to select them and then we find out later that they already were tipped off so their surprised reaction wasn't legit.  Similarly, I wouldn't like it, as a viewer, if the F2 knew ahead of time that he was selecting someone else.  It would be like watching Project Runway and hearing that the judges told one of the finalists that they aren't going to be chosen to protect their feelings during the final judging.  Then watching the person react like they've never been told anything it would make all the final shows worthless to me.
This is true but by then it’s too late. You’ve signed the contract. You take that risk when you sign up for the show.   And I don’t know why, in this day and age, people would still be stupid enough to go into this show blind. Do your research before you sign something. There are a hundred pre-screening things that need to happen before you’re actually selected. Not knowing how the show works is a choice, and not a smart one IMO.
Clare was fired.  She didn’t play along.  So if the lead wants their role they play along and get paid
No only Bachelorettes do.  That is my point with the exception of Matt on a normal season where F1 isn’t quitting the Bachelor has also done a 2 person FRC.
Didn’t Blake get in trouble for sharing stuff on podcasts that he wasn’t supposed to share? That’s a whole different animal than suing someone for trying to let down someone they loved and had sex with in a nicer way. Did they sue Clare for completely going off script from the start because she was in love? Naturally we all like some people on the show and dislike some people on the show due to what we see of their behavior and choices- it’s ok to criticize some people for behaving with less integrity than others.
I’m sure Clare would like to have gone traveling around the world taking Dale on every one on one date with the other men running along behind, but that’s not possible. She was calling him her husband from day 1 and completely closed herself off to the other guys. Remember how she would spend her time with the other guys talking about Dale? Production didn’t have a choice but to make a major change. She clearly breached every possible contract and they should have sued her if for no other reason than to show future leads they mean business, and yet they didn’t. I think there would absolutely be an uproar if we saw tabloid headlines “ABC Sues Hairdresser for Falling in Love Too Early on the Bachelorette” It would be embarrassing for them, and they’d get a lot of backlash. Even the least popular leads are usually fairly popular.
I think KNOWING and ~knowing~ are different. Like did Zach have a feeling about kaity early on? Yeah. Can he look back in hindsight from where he is today and say he knew it would probably be her?Yeah. But in that moment did he KNOW know? No, probably not. and I don’t think that means he wasn’t open to other relationships along the way, or that he bullshitted his way through. I say this as someone who really disliked him as a lead too.
I agree with a lot of this, the format of the show hasn’t changed at all in decades and it feels a bit stuffy and dated. These very formal rose ceremonies in prom style gowns, breaking up with each person by not offering them a rose, very rigid structure to the show in terms of how many get eliminated at rose ceremonies and when. I think it would still be a very entertaining show to watch if it was left more unstructured in terms of when and how people get dumped- clearly they need to change something up because the vast majority of the couples break up relatively quickly and I believe we the audience do want to feel like we are seeing two people falling in love who will ultimately get married and live happily ever after.
But I think that's precisely the problem. They THINK they know who they want, because they are acting on impulse, the one that they're physically attracted to because the time is very short.  The only way to challenge that physical attraction is to allow for contestants to give them time to reflect. Right now, its just a beauty contest in that most of them already know their F1 early on, which leaves very little surprises.  But your idea about twisting the timings is very very interesting actually. I think they can also overlap some of the shoots, sort of like forwards and flashbacks.  But they definitely need to make it fresh and mix up the format a little bit. Right now, the contestants are "performing" because they know the format.
I put private in quotes because I didn’t mean they should actually hide all their breakups off camera from viewers. Everything they do including all the breakups is captured on camera for the viewers. I don’t think they ever get any true private time other than in the fantasy suite. It just feels a lot more authentic when some of the breakups happen in a natural way rather than only within the confines of a rose ceremony. And for the F2 being dumped, it probably feels more “private” if it’s in their hotel room with one camera guy instead of on a proposal platform surrounded by flowers in a gown and heels with 80 cameras on them.
This just made me wonder - do we know if Clare got her full paycheck from the show or did she forfeit some of it by not fulfilling all her contractual obligations?
Don’t bachelorettes have a better track record of staying with the person they choose? There have been some bachelors who at least break up with some people before rose ceremonies or wherever the feeling happens to strike them. It always feels more authentic to me when leads go off script on the show. As if they’re sometimes forgetting they’re on a scripted reality show and acting how they would in a natural environment.
What exactly do you think she breached? They can't contractually force you to "be more open," because that's a completely nebulous and unprovable thing. We only know she was gushing over Dale because a. they showed us all of that with the editing when they have hours and hours of other footage they could have used and b. they explicitly encouraged it by sending him for extra private time with her. If they wanted to make an example of her they would have. They're not in the habit of being protective of people out of the goodness of their hearts. They didn't go against it because what happened gave them great television, and that's all they care about. They deliberately let her out of her contract because it was the smarter decision for them.  > “ABC Sues Hairdresser for Falling in Love Too Early on the Bachelorette”  This wouldn't be the headline though? If she was genuinely in breach of her contract and production was pissed off about it, the headline would be "ABC sues Clare Crawley for Contract Violation," and everyone probably would have agreed that if she left the show of her own volition that would be a violation and that's just Crazy Clare. Not sure why you think they'd ever call her "hairdresser" in a headline lol, no headline has ever done that with a well-known reality star because their names get way more clicks. When they sued Blake the headlines weren't "ABC Sues DJ for Speaking Mind About Franchise."
I don’t disagree they’re acting on impulse, but part of the show is to limit interactions and build up to that one point. I don’t think it’s just based on beauty, though. I think they feel a first connection with someone and really try to do as much as they can, which isn’t much, to explore that while also placating producers.  If they could actually date more, have more deep conversations, really get to know each other, and date like they’re actually dating around (including sex, overnight dates, etc.) and not have the pressure to choose just ONE person AND get engaged, I think it could work. But the same ending format? I think you’re just stretching out more of the same. I don’t think they realize they’re not good for each other until they get out of the bubble and into the real world. Some of the reason they almost always have a F1 (was Brad the only one who didn’t?) is because they keep them apart, keep them from anything real world.   I wouldn’t mind if they gave up the ultimate outcome, as I’m not really into the proposals. But so many viewers want that. Hell, I wouldn’t care I’d they ultimately didn’t choose someone, though having a finale where they decide to date exclusively might be nice (similar to Australia).
I understand what you mean about "private", but my view is that the final contestants should never be told, even on camera to be shown to the viewers, ahead of the most.dramatic.final.rose.ceremony ever.  In other words, no one in ANY competitive reality TV show, should be told before the final judgment what their fate is b/c otherwise it ruins the show, IMO.    I mean, I understand that it's the kind thing to do, but if you're signing up for this, you know what you're signing up for.
Lately, the Bachelors have been doing better. Katie, Gabby, and Rachel all had short-lived relationships. Clayton at least lived with Susie for a bit. Matt & Rachael are still together. And I think Zaity are making more of an effort than any of the recent female leads did with their F1s.
She referred to him as her husband the first time they met. That’s very highly unusual behavior for anyone whether they’re on TV or not, they wouldn’t have video footage of other leads calling someone their wife or husband on the first night because it wouldn’t happen. I imagine as soon as that happened, they were shocked and immediately scrambling for options.   Most people don’t watch the bachelor. If it’s a story specifically about who the lead chose that only bachelor fans would care about, yes they’d use their names. The names are meaningless to other people, and I would think it would be a general interest story if ABC sued a lead over doing something like trying to let their F2 down easily because they didn’t want to be a dick. Seeing a story about a massive corporation suing a “hairdresser” or a “teacher” because they did something in an effort to be kind would get a lot of clicks from non bachelor fans too. And no one would want to read a story that’s sympathetic to ABC. How in the world would you even spin it to make people feel bad for ABC?
Gabby and Rachel got the shit end of the stick, that double bachelorette format was ok for them getting to support each other but even worse than a typical season for finding a mate. They each had fewer men to choose from, and mid season when they both got harshly rejected by some of their own men it really dampened the experience for them I think.
What is up with everyone posting these podcast snips at 1.5x speed? 😅
He does this to potential guests or connections like Zach
A lot of contestants are friendly with podcasts, and I think it absolutely influences how people cover them. Katie does this too
There is nothing interesting about Nick Viall. Unless self-promotion is your thing
Ya I don’t knock Nick for wanting to know who is covering Bachelor Nation. I’d prob do the same thing. In case there’s a situation where you wanna clear something up, better to have a direct line. Is it strategic? Ya.
[removed]
sorry, it’s probably just me doing it every time haha. I just am so used to it and forget to switch it before I post. my apologies!
I think there’s a difference between being friendly with some podcasters and arranging introductory phone calls for strategic purposes. Like Katie wasn’t out there trying to get Juliet Litman on the phone so Juliet would stop saying weird things about Katie’s body and family history.
Isn't strategic a good thing?  I mean when you are in business, it's your job to plan, think and figure things out.  It's funny that people have a negative opinion of business strategy.    OF COURSE if you are in business you want to be networking within your "industry."
I couldn’t figure out if they thought strategic was good/smart or bad, because I absolutely think in a small world like BN, it makes sense to try to have an in-line to whoever you can. Companies employ people to do stuff like this in the communities they work in, with influencers, etc.  And Dave could, strategically, say, “Hey man, nice to meet you. I’m going to be objective with my reviews, but hope we can be professional with one another.”
Iirc the context is bc on Kaitlyn’s pod, Zach mentioned how Nick reached out to him buddy-buddy like and sent him his #, then talked shit on his podcast the next day. So Dave said basically “fun fact, he’s reached out to me before too.” The point is Nick’s “keep enemies close” M.O. and that topic. You don’t have to take the time to be a dick, instead post something you find interesting. It’s off season.
Haha no worries! I think my brain just works slower lol
yeah, my anxiety spiked through the roof listening to this. 😂 I'm a stoner, man. I can't handle the chipmunk version. Lol
I like it faster !
Respectfully, I disagree. I don’t think Nick came off super strategic. I think if we look at it from a place of empathy, he probably struggles with a lot of the negative opinions about him and it probably gives him a little bit of a feeling of control in an otherwise very toxic situation.
Mine too! It’s hard to follow what they’re saying.
i love that im being downvoted when Im the one who actually spoke to nick. Y'all are extra today.
I agree with you.  I can’t even imagine how people’s comments make him or anyone in the public eye feel. I could never function under that much public scrutiny.
Sure. We can give him the benefit of the doubt, but if he struggled with it that much he would tone down the arrogance. With that said, if I were a Nick Viall I would get a lay of the land too. No harm in doing a little reconnaissance.
but I will say, having received kind words from him about my channel and then still having not been invited on his podcast is telling. ;)   im like the side chick that doesnt get to meet his parents
Did you tell him you want to go on his show, or did he say he’d like to invite you on? I’d love more context!   I don’t listen to a lot of his guest podcasts because I mostly don’t know who the people are, but if I hear he has a BN person on, I listen because I actually think Nick does a pretty good interview.   If you want quid pro quo with Nick, though, get that agreement up front. People complain he only has them on his show, but never asked to do a 1:1 trade deal back to their own pod (or whatever).
This is hilarious
Did not sleep last night because of anxiety, thought I could make it through the day, quickly realized I needed to take a half day. Then realized before my last morning class that I needed to go but was too stubborn to ask either of my coworker friends with plan during that class to help…so I ended up breaking down instead and having like five teachers show up to help and send me home.   I’m embarrassed, but wow, I have good coworkers at least.
What’s a good thing to cook for dinner for a guy for a date ? Having him over . Something that shows off my cooking skills but also not time consuming 😂
How do y’all deal with VERY difficult people? My boss is driving me nuts and I want to metaphorically pull out my hair!! It’s beating me up inside anxiety, energy, headache wise!! 😭
I can't believe Americans don't get a 4 day weekend for Easter. You people get ripped off lol.
Any recommendations on where to buy perfume? My mom usually gifts the girls in our family Victoria secret perfume. While I used to love the scent, I’m kinda over it. She gets us the same one every year. I tried my local Ulta but I thought most of the scents were too sweet/fruity. I’ve never bought my own perfume lol so I wasn’t sure what prices I should be looking at either? I want one for every day and one for nice occasions!
Don’t be embarrassed. Anxiety is the worst. I hope you feel better very soon. You got this! Hugs to you.
What do you like to cook? I think having more details would help.  I put together a very random pasta dish for my husband a few weeks ago - ziti with homemade dairy free ricotta (super simple to make) I reserved some of the pasta water and added spinach, the pasta, and the ricotta with capers and some lemon. It’s something he’s asked for like 5 times since.   I’ve also become a fan of homemade pizza dough and making pizza or a monkey bread out of it. Super simple and tasty.   You could do a take on orange chicken, or tacos, or a hat ever your favorite dish is.
Penne alla vodka is easy and yummy!
My friend cooked me gnocchi in sauce and roasted cauliflower!! It was so good I’m def gonna make it again for myself
My ex cooked chicken parm for me since it’s my favorite meal but also did a homemade pizza on another date so that’s an idea. They have pizza dough at grocery stores
I made salmon bowls with rice and crispy Brussel sprouts for my gf on a date and she loved it. I think salmon bowls are pretty easy especially if u have an air fryer
I have the benefit of working remotely, so I put myself on mute, lol.
Canadian here. We get 3. Good Friday is the holiday off work
Ugh I wish! My job gets 0 days off for Easter
Ok so I’m an Ulta stan because they have an amazing rewards program so if you end up finding a perfume you like I would check and see if they have it available (and then wait and buy it on a 5x points day).   But my recommendation is a somewhat weird one. Smell more random people (in a polite non creepy way). My aunt ALWAYS smells amazing and whenever she stays with us I ask her what he perfumes are and if I can sample it for a day. If I smell someone’s good perfume in a coffee shop or something I have no shame in asking them either.   Also if you find one you like I’d reccomend testing it on your own body first. If someone that smells good gives you a rec go to a store spray that perfume on you and go about your day. I’ve had perfumes that smell too good but too strong and give me a headache or they smell different on me then they do on other people. You can even pick up a travel size to test out first they’re usually only $30 or less and super helpful to keep in a car or gym bag. I have found two perfumes I love, one that I wear daily and one that is a stronger more sexy special occasion perfume and I have about 5 travel size ones that I use when I go on vacation or if I want a little variety.   Perfume actually goes bad over time. It usually doesn’t start to smell bad just weakens/changes over time so if you want to have a perfume collection/an assortment of perfumes or colognes then getting smaller bottles and travel sizes is super great!!
Sephora? They have a lot of options, that’s where I’ve always found mine
Ariana Grande cloud is my favorite
My favorite (you can get it at Ulta) is Carolina Herrera’s Good Girl. It’s not sweet or fruity. I used to wear it only for nice occasions but I’ll wear it on regular days sometimes too. 🤷
Saks for higher end perfumes. Sephora and macys have a good selection as well.
If yah dont like fruity, Armani code is my go to. It's expensive but you don't need much so the bottle goes a long way.
Homemade pizza is a good idea! If you have a Trader Joe’s around you, they have amazing crust! The trick is to toast it first THEN put the toppings on and then cook all the way through. Crispy crust and yummy pizza
Jealous!! Unfortunately this difficult boss knows how to be difficult over email as well!! Very passive aggressive 😭
My fav as well! the heel bottle is fun
Me every time IG accounts pair Aven with WOC in their fantasy Paradise casts like that man’s not going straight for Katherine, Christina, or Jess  ![gif](giphy|DPqqOywshrOqQ|downsized)
RS: The “Bachelorette” episode 5 begins filming today in New Orleans, LA.  So does this mean Zachary Reality is right😭
Joey HAS to be her F1 at this point 😭😭. I predicted him as the F1 as soon as I saw his picture and I’ve never guessed right before so this makes me excited that I actually might have been right and clocked her type with precision.  ![gif](giphy|l4pTsh45Dg7jnDM6Q|downsized)

It’s going to be such a letdown when Joey’s hometown date is in fucking ROYERSFORD PENNSYLVANIA instead of Hawaii 😭  https://wcupagoldenrams.com/sports/mens-tennis/roster/joey-graziadei/6806
I can't stand ZR, but it looks like someone shared a potential date with him:  https://twitter.com/zacharyreality/status/1644031883066630144?t=Kq72TjqV1kT7GN3JwD18cA&s=19
1. I can’t believe Sean is still there bc I thought he’d be out week one or two 2. I wish there was video of Charity and Joey bc I can’t get a read on anything with these photos 😩 3. Manifesting us seeing the other guys tomorrow, and getting photos and videos from her one on one tomorrow!  ![gif](giphy|Cy8dxpgcMHD5ILVHO0)
Honestly, it's possible that Joey got the FIR and didn't kiss Charity after she gave it to him, as we know he and the other guys admitted they hadn't kissed her yet on that group date. Whether it was Charity's decision not to kiss or he didn't feel it necessary in that moment. So I'm definitely not ruling him out as FIR, which is the final piece of the puzzle at this point.
RS posted Charity is on a date, and it looks public. Hopefully, we get a pic of the guy she is on the 1-on-1 with. Could be a frontrunner.

These are the people I gathered confirmed to be still in the running, then some in question. Am I missing anyone?  Sean  Aaron B Dotun  Tanner  Xavier Joey  Michael John Henry? Brayden? Aaron s? Adrian?
From @bachelorwhatever  https://preview.redd.it/uz4fd31luasa1.jpeg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=08f3a5ef721773fb987c80353cc4d0662fde7461
Found this on New Orleans snap chat. I’m uploading the video right now but here are screen shots  https://preview.redd.it/m61tm4z58dsa1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=90b4823354ece24158f324ef248d0cbe2662d245
I’m confused.  Is this Twitter pic a group date that turned into a 1-1?  If that’s the case, then Joey may not be F1, because based on past seasons, week 5 1-1s, were done individually.  I don’t remember week 5 1-1s, where that usually meant the person on that date, was most likely F1, were done from group dates.  This date is reminiscent of when the Clayton’s girls arrived in Europe and he took Teddi on the date.  She never made F4.  I think Joey is definitely in the Final 4, but I don’t know if he’s F1.  That leaves Michael, Brayden, Adrian, Aaron S. and possibly John Henry that are left.
Me coming here literally about to do some more John B as frontrunner hype to start new day, only to find out from @bachelorehatever that he just viewed her story! 😩  ![gif](giphy|AS5YEjTdZZo6WYsoZP)  First Warwick out, now John B. Taking PTO break today from spoilers to mend my heart! 💔
Rip my first Asian bachelor hopes. Welp, always next season 🥺
Why is RS gatekeeping from us I know he has way more info than he’s posting
I predict Joey will be F1.   Time to clock out!   Someone stamp this time and date.
I’m all past my mourning phase for Warwick and John B. I can only hope TPTB can do Justice with their edits and make Warwick Next Bachelor or give them level of GSJ love.   I can now fully focus on cheering on Charity’s last 10-11 men remaining and see who is most suitable for her.
Who is definitely still there?
Michael F1 & Joey F2 🤣 I’m Raven Baxter to this ish ☠️ watch y’all jinx him and he goes home before hometown 😭😭
Are Black women in the franchise actually into Aven or is it just some weirdo people in this franchise who put the onus of “Black love” on Black women to uphold and jump at the chance to be with any Black/biracial man? Because I think it’s the latter.  People are always pushing for him and Rodney to be the next Bachelor and I’m like, why? Some people on here need to be a little more discerning on where they throw their support to. Not all skin folk is kinfolk…especially in this franchise.   I root for wonderful women to find the men they desire who also match their energy; not for them to get pressured to accept a guy/chase after them so random strangers can get…well whatever it is they keep inorganically pushing for year after year
I still want him to pick a WOC. People were saying the same thing about Rodney and he really liked Eliza.
I think it’s possible because of budget cuts. I wouldn’t be surprised though if it’s similar to Michelle’s season (first one post Covid bubble) where it’s all in the US and then for overnights and the finale it’s in one location outside of the US, such as Mexico
Maybe, maybe not. In the past they’ve done multiple weeks of domestic travel, but still got at least some international in before hometowns. I think Becca’s season had 3 weeks domestic, one week international before hometowns.
New Orleans? #tbt 😫  https://preview.redd.it/cbnafx8esbsa1.png?width=686&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b98d402dc4b4514a567d7788b25eeec723266dd8
Maybe. I think it’s much easier for people like him to get info on domestic locations. More fans of the show in the US than abroad.  I think they’ll try to go to Mexico or the DR or somewhere else close with good beach for fantasy suites and the finale. Just better visuals.
Budget cuts 🤷‍♀️
Urgh, don't get me wrong, the dates abroad always suck too because they feel like wasted potential (i.e. going all the way to a 1000+ year old city just to do an odd therapy date or just to make fun of their "weird" food).  But why is the 20th season of a show the time they supposedly choose to focus on budgets (if that's the reason)? It's BS. Because if they roll this back for the Bachelor (which at this point has had worse ratings than the Bachelorette) or change it up for the Bachelorette 2024, I'm going to be pissed.  But if they are going to only have this in the US, I hope they truly are thoughtful because there are so many amazing cities and spots to explore; not the same old shit. Like imagine if they had the final rose ceremony or overnights in a National Park?!!! Obviously they'd have to be careful with the environment and wild life but doing it in Olympic National Park or Zion???? Amazing!
Do we know where in New Orleans yet?
That is good to hear. Kudos to ZR.
My only correct prediction was Blake M for Katie before he was even put onto the season 💀 I was so close with gabi for Zach. Manifesting Joey for charity so we can be right
nooo lmao I was so looking forward to a Hawaii hometown date. If abc was smart they would just let fantasy suites/FRC be in Hawaii cause atp Joey is guaranteed a top 3 spot.
All that money they saving staying domestic, they better fly her to Honolulu International Airport expeditiously.
Oh damn Charity likes PA men then since Tanner is from Pittsburgh. Yay finally some PA representation!!
So maybe they had two travel days, then there will be a 1 on 1 tomorrow (4/7), group date 4/8, another 1 on 1 4/9, then rose ceremony on 4/10?  ETA: it also looks like this is a big public 10k, so we should hopefully get some photos. I would personally self-eliminate if someone tried to make me run a 10k out of nowhere though lol.
Sean looks like a typical SEC frat boy with the long hair and big cross necklace. I’m not surprised he’s still around.
Joeys definitely getting a hometown at this rate
Just heard that it’s Joey. Someone dmed me and said a friend of theirs saw them.
Good finds! Based on my totally legit body language analysis based on minimal info, I don’t see the connection between them. Setting him up to be the next lead imo.

I’m no body language expert but they’re not even looking at each other while he’s talking, and her leg is crossed away from him… hmm ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thinking_face_hmm)
Can you send the link?
I’m thinking maybe the guys were split into 2 group dates?
They are in top 10 right now at minimum.  For sure there are Joey, Tanner, Sean, Aaron B, Xavier, Michael, Dotun, and John Henry. So that’s 8 confirmed. The other 2-3 could be Brayden, Adrian, and Aaron S.
I wouldn't be surprised if there is a dark horse we don't know about who makes f4.
I moved John B up to final two last night after seeing the video of that kiss 😭. He must have had an interesting exit if he went home after doing all that on the group date. That kiss had a little too much passion for an exit, in my opinion. Might have had the frontrunners side-eying him.  Joey, Tanner, Michael and John B were in my original top 4 prediction after the photos dropped so I would be right for 3 out of 4 of them if @bachelorwhatever is correct. John Henry being the dark horse was not on my radar at all.
That seems to be a very strong final four possibility.   Knowing that John B is out and that Joey, Michael and John Henry couldn’t have had FIR.  It feels like a good chance Tanner got FIR
I thought John Henry had activity on instagram?
Oooh Tanner was my predicted F1 👀  Also, had Michael in my F4 picks. I could deff see him making it far. Hope we get FIR spoilers soon
I would be very happy if that was Charity’s top 4. Does anyone know when Reality Steve tells us who is Final 1?  I’m very new to spoilers. Is it a month before premiere episode, a week before…?
I kind of hope that John Henry isn’t picked for my own selfish desire to watch him as the bachelor. It would be the first time I’m actually extremely attracted to a male lead. A girl can dream 😂.
We keep getting pics of the same guys we have already seen😭 I want to know who else made it far.
“NEW ORLEANS” was screamed off a balcony minutes prior
Sean, tanner, dotun, Aaron, and ?
https://preview.redd.it/4rnk4xa78dsa1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3dd511315bbc0fc3c07c0e5dea284c30b2549f5d
They might do what they did today for tomorrow’s one on one and maybe that’s why they split up the guys? Hopefully we’ll get stuff tomorrow!
Y’all downvoted me but a frontrunner would not be forced to wear a fake naked costume on a group date. Frontrunners are protected during those silly group dates.
looks like she deleted the post off her story because i no longer see it?
Im sad, i thought producers would want him yo go far….
There’s always a paradise redemption
Bachelor Season 28 has to be Asian. No exceptions! Prob won’t happen. They are literally about to have contestants on who were born after the franchise started 22 years ago, and still no AAPI lead! 🤯
Not me coming to scour the spoiler thread before bed time, only to leave heartbroken 😭
This is nothing new. He always does this shit. It's a complete, and total pain in the ass. 🤨😒
Strong possibility, but we know he isn’t FIR and that still carries a lot of weight with bachelorettes
The only definite is Joey as we know he got a rose episode 4.   Likely based on know SM activity as well as people on dates claiming they saw chemistry or possibility of being a front runner  Tanner, Aaron B, Michael, Sean  Those are the 5 I feel most confident are still left
There's usually 12 in week 5, right?! I mean that's how many were left in the past seasons.
They keep trying to push these biracial men who prefer white as ideal black bachelors and I’m baffled. I understand white people doing it and preferring half white men. Black women voting against their own interests is strange though. There were black female fanpages more concerned about Rodney being lead than charity. Just odd  The same ones would be mad if he was made bachelor and got up there and did the same Matt James speech on pressure to choose black and not seeing color and his mom being abandoned by his black dad because he would! He gave his diversity speech at his bday and the only woman with any color in there was serene.   I don’t want to see another black bachelor unless he is a monoracial black man or at least has a black mom and prefers black women.
The same Rodney who ignored eliza in real life when they met before the show? Rodney had a white girl at home and is dating one now. I only see him with white women and his following list is full of them.  That would’ve been a disaster for eliza if she stuck with him. Those types love to play the black love card for cameras because black women eat it up.  Let those biracial men be with women like their mothers that they prefer
idk If Rodney  liked Eliza lol. Prob liked the idea of her more. The man went right back to his type when he left paradise
I do not wish biracials with “whites only” signs on their dicks upon any WOC. Let him date what he is into. If a WOC wants to find a MOC that is into them, they need to look outside of this franchise. This franchise is notorious for selecting MOC who don’t date WOC, especially if the woman isn’t mixed/lightskinned.
90% of the instamodels he follows are white and blonde.
Rodney had a gf back home.
Ok that’s makes sense, it seemed like Zach’s season started traveling so fast but I forgot that’s not true for all seasons. I guess we’ll just have to wait and see.
PAIN
In an alternate universe Jabby is thriving 😫
I don’t think the National Park Service would ever comp the show which is how the travel works. The show doesn’t pay - it asks the city or resort to provide free hotel for cast and production and free filming locations in exchange for promotion.   The show reaches out to tourism boards and resorts and picks based on the deals and packages they can get. But now that the show is significantly less popular it’s not going to get as much interest. Combine that with taxpayer complaints and US cities will be wary.
When Chris' season only traveled for overnights the rumor was because he had a DWI and couldn't get a work visa for a bunch of different countries. No idea if that is why and I can't see that being the case for Charity.
I bet they will be walking around the French quarter, Jackson square, Cafe de Monde (i think it was during nicks season where Rachel and him ate some food there). No way they aren’t going to walk around, so I’m sure pictures/videos will get out.
🙌🏾 Yesss let’s manifest. I’m so unreasonably excited that I guessed he would be F1 off of a single picture before any of the filming clues dropped. After seeing he got the week five 1-on-1, I feel comfortable to start some playful banter…  TEAM JARITY STAND THE FUCK UP!! 🔥🔥🔥I WANNA SEE YOU STAND 😭😭😭
If once season is done filming, and I see alot of things pointing to him as F1, you’re correct lol. My confidence is gonna get me jinxed eventually, but if I still feel strong about him post-filming, we will be correct with our manifestations 😂
I would be eliminated by default bc I would die
Is the race only one day? If so, they might not have a choice and will just film the two one on ones today and tomorrow.
Ya, I get it 😂. I realize I'm probably just trying to shoehorn him in as F1 to make it easier.
Andi didn't kiss Nick.
Since the show is staying domestic and if he gets a hometown, at least Charity gets to go to Hawaii since he’s from and lives there I believe.
Damn, 2 group date roses and a week 5 1-on-1 for Joey. I think he’s a lock for the top 3 if not F1.
Oop👀 It's looking more and more that Joey could be f1.
Joey really bout to win!! lol
I said the same thing when I saw the photos lol. But need a video/ stuff with other guys to confirm. I thought similar with Arie and Lauren so who knows haha.
Her right hand underneath her leg made me giggle. She probably did it out of habit, but still 😅.
I agree, but the other pic RS posted showed some chemistry. I think we just need a video to confirm😂
There’s no oomph
This is such a nice picture lol and beautiful people. I'm liking the vibes and smiles
I was going to say maybe they all met up, and then she took him on a 1-on-1. At this point though there has to be more guys left, so im confused.
The guys all look so into her!! I'm liking this group!
Hmmm so it wasn’t a true 1:1 from Joey? Since it looks like he just won more time post a group date.
https://twitter.com/therealhoarse/status/1644120255403286529?s=46&t=xtdEWNeEEHbycPsLAIes5A
My current guess is Adrian based off of nothing but vibes lol and he was dressed nice during the Barbie date I think
John Henry is from Virginia Beach. Never underestimate a Virginia Beach contestant 😂
I also was thinking other guys that she likes just as much or more might have complained to Charity about him. I feel like she will not be the type to want to keep guys who have drama surrounding them, similar to Zach. It’s a shame, I think John is so cute!
The only thing I saw was yesterday he was down two followers I think, but today it’s only 1 so nothing that indicates he’s gone
Whenever he confirms who F1 is. It could be as late as a week before the finale airs or even a day before. We never know when he’s going to get the spoilers and he usually won’t release them now without being certain they’re correct.
Correct me if I’m wrong but I think this is the first time we’ve gotten photo proof of Dotun still being there? But yeah other than him we’ve seen these other guys plenty of times already lol
Maybe dotun had that other week three one on one
Xavier maybe?
Xavier
Yeah, we knew it was over for Gabi when TPTB chose to air her talking about peeing her pants
She also talked about it in yesterdays spoiler thread
I’m not even Asian though POC but the franchise needs an Asian lead. It’s gotten ridiculous and it really doesn’t matter what season he comes from or where he placed   If not Asian then a brown Latino who dates WOC in real life
At least ABC has yet to renew The Bachelor for season 28 that will be most likely next month.
Now there’s people here saying that FIR could’ve been part of the kissing competition date lol. Idk why they would be dumb to announce that in group date knowing that it will get spoiled by audience that “no one at the group date was FIR”. That would be so dumb and reckless to announce.
How many are usually left episode 5? Isn’t episode 6 hometowns?
Yes. In according to numbers comparing in past Bachelor/ette seasons on the week 5 competition:  * Zach's season: 11 women * G&R's season: 14 men * Clayton's season: 12 women * Michelle's season: 11 men * Katie's season: 12 men * Matt James's season: 15 women * Clayshia's season: 16 men (the week held as Tayshia's second week) * Peter's season: 12 women * Hannah's season: 12 men * Colton's season: 13 women * Becca's season: 12 men * Arie's season: 13 women (initially 12 women started in the week) * Rachel's season: 12 men * Nick's season: 12 women * JoJo's season: 11 men * Ben Higgins's season: 11 women * Kaitlyn's season: 12 men * Chris's season: 11 women * Andi's season: 11 men * Juan Pablo's season: 11 women * Desiree's season: 11 men * Sean's season: 11 women * Emily's season: 10 men * Ben Flajnik's season: 11 women * Ashley's season: 11 men * Brad's second season: 11 women
And it was obvious he deemed the white woman who was interested as not attractive enough or too old, lace. The Victoria Fs and Genevieves had no interest in him. Even his friend Kay from the betchelor podcast said Rodney had no other options on the beach when talking about the beach pressuring eliza
They traveled internationally really early in Colton's season too (seems to be more common for the Bachelor vs. Bachelorette, annoying). They went to Singapore in week 3 with like 15 women lol.
Jason deserves better - SO MUCH BETTER!
I wish I knew when / where so I could go snap pics!!!
Big bird is the new kermit the frog this season right?  ![gif](giphy|5BbHwPRSgnZw4|downsized)  **JARITY** is the newest ship name to join Bachelor Reddit nation! Bring it!  Edit: but what if John Henry is F1 would that still be Jarity? 💀
If he’s F1 I will certainly put respect on your name and remind everyone they saw it here first!! Lol   What made you guess him? Looks, vibe, what?
At least we’d get one of those dramatic ambulance scenes if so lol
It's an annual event. It starts at 8:00 in the morning and it sounds like they will have to run in costume.
I think someone said he’s actually from Pennsylvania or somewhere nearby. He moved to Hawaii to work at a resort or something like that. I doubt production will pay to go to Hawaii for this season.
Still keeping my fingers crossed that TPTB give her Greece too! 🤞🏾
But do you think production would really be okay with making it so obvious?! I’m mean come on… that being said I think they look cute together ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grin)
Maybe they split the guys up and half met up today and the other half tomorrow with whoever gets that one on one.
> I was going to say maybe they all met up, and then she took him on a 1-on-1.  That could be a possibility!  > At this point though there has to be more guys left, so im confused.  I’m so annoyed like why is it the same guys every time😩
Yeah I’m confused by that too, maybe the rose from the other day was from his 1 on 1?
What the, that’s odd. So this would be his second time winning a group date?
Ty💜
If i was the bachelorette, adrian would be f1 from whar i saw (seems such a nice guy)… f4 for sure for me. Fingers crossed he makes at least f7
![gif](giphy|llC8GQxTDwXW5nGqvP)
John B is fiiiine. And his kiss was doing what it needed to do - make the frontrunners nervous 😂. I’m very interested to see how producers played around with that leading up to his exit. I feel like when a contestant does such a bold display of affection like that, producers try to cause trouble and get reactions/drama from the other guys.  In my opinion, the kiss showed that John had some chemistry with Charity. And if it ends up being true that she sent John B home despite this chemistry, then she could have been mitigating what the other men saw as a threat to keep her top two/three guys happy.  This is just my imagination running rampant with the evidence we have. Watch John B still be there 👀.
Got it. Does it usually mean contestants are still there when their followers don’t change?
Oh really?! I’m going to have to wait that long   well good to know, thanks!
I think you’re right
She’s at around 10 left?
oh so it was posted in yesterday’s spoiler thread, not her story? got it, thanks!
Didn’t the person who attended the group date say though that they were asked and admitted it.  Charity saying she was smitten after N1 definitely leads me to believe she kissed someone
Episode 7 or 8 is hometowns  I would expect 10 are there now   Them 8 next week  Then 6 the week before hometowns
They’re always favoriting the Bachelor, even tho the Bachelorette has a better success rate🙄
G&R's season also traveled international very early to France within a cruise ship ride.
So true bestie! Ready for Jason’s glow up
Run down to Bourbon Street and whip that phone out.
I’m pretty sure today is the first 1-on-1. So maybe they will start filming it now or in like an hour or two haha.
Looks like they’re at bourbon street right now!
![gif](giphy|VQ3ENfCBw7ljlvRo0u)  TEAM JOHN HARITY STAND UP!! 🔥🔥🔥  Just kidding 😭.
Just his look and vibe like you mentioned! He looked hot but not intimidating hot. His vibe from the pic gave friendly and approachable. Same age as her. I felt like Charity would be attracted to him, for sure. I’m excited to hear her first impression of him during limo entrances ☺️.
Running a 10k in a costume???!!! WTF kind of date is that? 😬🙄
![gif](giphy|pD368cmNo02G5qoV5i)
Me too.
Please use your manifesting powers to conjure up different guys tomorrow🙏🏾
This would make the most sense. Now watch us not get anything tomorrow😭
Not necessarily but that’s the only change on his profile, everything else has stayed the same
I don’t doubt you at all, I just thought  that would be so reckless on their part to reveal to an audience knowing it will get spoiled.
Not recently, to be fair
Ok that’s clever AF! 🤣👏
I’ll try 🤣
I’m going to be so annoyed bc I need to see her with more guys. And also who the final guys missing are!
Yea trying to find that user again. To me it makes sense though.   If Joey was FIR, week 2 GD rose winner, week 4 GD rose winner, and week 5 1 on 1, then everyone might as well quit. Lol   I feel like production wouldn’t allow that.
At that point, I’ll just cheer them on as a bystander and enjoy free food and accommodations lol. Get some screentime and start shit so I can get on paradise. I’ll wait my turn to eventually be eliminated and do the Caelynn-exit-style to Joey “Get engaged” 🤪  Edit: not only the GD Week 2 rose but he got a full night portion 1-on-1 with charity after that group date, so technically this will be his second 1-on-1 if you think about it.
I wonder if Joe is also filming the show Tayshia is filming, he mentioned on the podcast that the latest episode of clickbait was going to be pre recorded and he is not gonna be hosting clickbait for a few weeks as he has an exciting opportunity coming up
A friend of mine came across Nick’s podcast on tiktok and she spent 5 minutes telling me about a guy who had a successful season” on the show. 💀💀 the whole time she was talking about Nick and was like the way he talks about the show and others on the show you’d think he’s married to his f1 and his kids with her 😭
I just finished watching Desiree’s season. Chris’s proposal was so sweet! I’m surprised it doesn’t come up more when people talk about the most romantic proposals/moments on the show. The season also had more drama than I thought based on the way people talked about it; I knew about the Brooks stuff, but there was plenty happening pre-hometowns as well. I can’t believe I’d never heard about them bringing a guy’s girlfriend to the mansion to the call him out lol.
Are Peter and Kelly still together?
Where’d the Natalie post go? After seeing ppl fight over age gaps in UO, now I want to see the post. I skipped over it initially since I figured nothing good can come out of it, lmao.
Looks like Zach has moved his stuff to Austin now? Kaity just posted Zach on her story saying it’s their first night out in Austin 🫶🏼
Is anyone besides Ashley Spivey talking about what is going on TN right now? So many alums live there. I want to give my follow to anyone who is.
Does anybody remember Matt’ story about his credit score? 325 I think it was
I thought about it as well! But there are so many shows it could be though
That’s a good guest!! He hasn’t been on social media in a while not even with Serena  🤔
I'm watching it rn, and for a "typical" Bachelor/Bachelorette szn, this strikes as a good balance between fun, drama, and romance.
I watched Des’s season when it aired. Chris’s proposal was overshadowed by the Brooks breakup. Everyone thought Des settled, and that Brooks was her real F1.
Not sure. Last we heard, they are but being very private ever since they got back together though. The one thing we do know however is that Kelley and Barb had some type of a fallout and she's on her shitlist now. It's probably a matter of time before Kelley and Peter break up again because no way would he ever marry someone who didn't get along with his mom. The Weber clan seem too tight knit to ever let anything break them up, IMO.
I’m nosy, what was the post about?
Huh? Why would Matt publicly talk about his credit score? 😕
Omg that is horrible
I didn’t know that was possible.
Agree! Desiree wasn’t the most dynamic lead, but she was likable enough and had a solid narrative with “no one has ever loved me as much as I’ve loved them,” and production and the men came through.
Why doesn’t Barb like Kelley anymore?
It was a pic that Nick took of Natalie at a beach back when they weren’t dating yet, and she captioned it that she later told him she wanted to date him and that we all know how that went. She was wearing a bikini and looked very busty.  I scrolled past it because it was of those posts that had hundreds of comments but minimal likes. Comments section was def a mess, lmao.
It was a few weeks ago.   He said he was asking for his neighbor. He was asking for advice on how to raise it
It's literally all that needs to happen for a season lol.
Nobody knows for sure what really happened, but Barb unfollowed Kelley on IG awhile back which implies that something BIG did indeed happen.
I am over sex week drama on this show. It's boring and redundant.
You can feel bad for Gabi but I think the people saying that Kaity shouldn’t post with Zach bc of Gabi or saying how could Kaity be with Zach when he hurt her friend Gabi are weird AF. Gabi and Kaity aren’t a 20 year long friendship, literally the reason they met was because they both went on the show to date Zach.
Getting blocked by contestants is never the flex people think it is. Especially when it's coupled with "and I have no idea why!" and they post what they did and it's 100% obvious why they were blocked.   On that note, contestants have every right to block, delete, and lock down their social media as they see it. It shouldn't be seen as some kind of moral failing or coward response when they do.
Do people actually enjoy the GOR voice impressions and sound effects? I like the concept of the podcast so I listen frequently but god damn they’re so annoying.
None of the age gap relationships are even comparable to Nick and Natalie.  Joe and Serena were 24 and 35; 11 years is not even 2/3 the gap of Nick and Natalie, and 24 is Much different than 19.   Mari and Kenny is closer, but again, 25 is far different than 19.  An 18 year age gap when you're just over 18 is very weird, and I'm not a fan of that age gap (or Nick Viall, in any way), but I don't think it's worthwhile to extrapolate to different situations that aren't nearly as uncomfortable/borderline predatory and infantilize women in their mid-twenties.   It cheapens words like "grooming" and "predatory" to assign it to adult women choosing to be with men 8-15 years older than them.
In a few years, I think it's possible Kaitlyn will talk about Jason how she talks about Shawn.
There seems to be a lot of comparisons between Clayton/Susie and Kaity/Zach. For some reason I believe Kaity and Zach more than I ever believed Clayton and Susie as a lasting couple.
This sub claims to be so smart and aware of producer manipulation,  but falls for contestant manipulation every damn time.     Gabi and Ariel are playing characters and playing you for a fool.
Reality shows that mostly cast "reality show stars" from other shows, especially the ones that just do that for a living now (and forgotten random "celebs"), are just sad to me.
I don’t understand everyone’s obsession with Ariel. Everyone seems to think she is so exotic and different. She appears to be a normal person who happens to be Jewish. She’s beautiful and carries herself well, but she’s not a unicorn or a major successful person.
I don’t like that people use the dating and relationship thread against users here. They’re being vulnerable by sharing, have a little compassion. I’ve seen it so many times on this sub. It’s amazing anyone shares anything personal in here.
I truly don’t know what the fuck y’all mean when you comment “I miss when the man cast as the bachelor was a legit catch.” The last few bachelors have all been conventionally attractive, tall men who are close with their family, successful in their careers, and largely considered kind people who just make poor choices. Peter was a fucking pilot. Matt has a non-profit. Zach’s former coworker has commented several times that he was well liked and very good at his tech sales job. How are they not a catch? These are by all accounts rich, vaguely hot, successful men. What more do you want? Barack Obama?
This sub likes to project their own issues on the contestants.  Kaity and Gabi’s issue with Zach wasn’t that he had sex.  Both knew that could happen/if it happens it didn’t mean they were F1.    Same with last year only Susie cared about the sex.  It wasn’t what Rachel or Gabby was upset with.  Yet this many here blame it on the sex not the other actions and words (which is what did upset the women).  Just because it may upset you doesn’t mean it does them. -
There's gotta be a correlation between all of the unhealthy shit I see in the Sunday relationships thread and being heavily invested in this franchise.
this sub thinks it's progressive, but some of the comments about natalie in that thread yesterday were nasty as hell. not liking a woman isn't an excuse to break out the misogyny, but some people here seem to think it's a perfect excuse.
Gabi and Kaity look like pioneer women from Quakertown in their cast photos.
Krystal was by far the best part of Arie's season.
This sub is weirdly obsessed with Madi. I don’t like her either but that’s also why I don’t care about every story she posts and interview she does. I don’t super mind just skipping the posts, all I mean is there is a TON of chatter here from supposed haters…  This show is a waste of my time when it doesn’t end in engagement. Idc how fake it all is I want to pretend  Your dream about the bachelor or your husbands text about the episode or whatever random shit you guys like to post here is not interesting 🗣️🗣️
I like Nayte's tiktoks and I think they're funny! I pretty much like every tiktok from Bach people that's fun and or/funny. If anything, it endears me towards the person/people in it. What's more annoying is people hating when it's just harmless fun or people going every time "I don't get tiktok" or "I wish the lip syncing trend would die" or "why is he/she saying that" when it's clearly an audio.
I don’t care much for any of them, but the harping on Andrew/Justin/Nayte/Rodney for partying and not being in public, serious relationships feels off to me. The men have always used the post show time/attention this way, but when its this group some people seem to have a lot more to say. Not to mention the people who love to say Justin and Andrew are somehow leeching off of their friendship with Greg - as if his reputation wasn’t only rehabilitated after Katie’s season from people seeing him on Andrew and Justin’s social media. Without them, he would have faded away with a reputation as a sad boy gaslighter.
Unpopular opinion.  Love is Blind is way better than the Bachelor.m and has kind of ruined the franchise for me.  I used to love the Bachelor, but it really comes off as kind of phony now after watching Love Is Blind.
jason is not going to marry kaitlyn
i don’t get how some people say they don’t listen to viall files because they find nick misogynist, but still tune in regularly to GOR. and to be clear im notttt a fan of nick’s lol
why are folks on this sub back to stanning reality steve? did we forget about his sexual harassment of demi? his smear campaign of jenna? his general track record of being loud and wrong? he also actively hates this subreddit what is going on
The obsession with needing to be spoiled and knowing all the upcoming cast members life history and searching out all of these sneaky photos of the upcoming season being filmed is weird to me.    Why not….just wait until the season airs and enjoy it as it happens?    What benefit do you get knowing everything 3 months ahead of time?
Reality TV - in this case The Bachelor - is not the place to watch an actual romance unfold* lol.  Edit: *usually lol
Gabi and Kaity don't need to be friends
I would love if the posters here who call clearly conventionally attractive men like Zach unattractive would be forced to post pics of their boyfriends/husbands/etc. It would be a laugh. If you have to look like Tyler C to be considered attractive, then honestly, most of the women don't measure up to that level either and goes against the narrative of there being higher beauty standards for women.
It’s so weird when users here complain that people are being too positive or nice to a former contestant for something completely harmless. It’s just so bizarre to me. And it’s always the same users complaining about the same contestants. Just avoid threads specifically about those people like I do the Madi threads.
Katie and Andrew S are soulmates. If she chose him, they would’ve made it to marriage.
Madi posts give me life
I’m not a fan of Gabi and seem to be the one one on this sub who feels that way.
Very predictable that everytime a Madi post does numbers people run to this thread to ask why people care so much. Yes, we need to know you're so above talking about Madi and snarking in general.
I know Gabi has a crush on Tyler C (like everyone) but there’s no way he would be interested. I don’t see her as his type at all
Nick and Natalie’s age difference has been discussed to death and should be counted as repeat post since there’s never anything new to add.
Having WOC on this show is great but there should be more mono-racial black women on this show. Mercedes, Kylee, Aly, etc are all mixed women. the only mono-racial women of Zach’s season were Brianna and Charity. Charity is ette so she obviously won’t be on the beach and Brianna probably won’t be invited. I wanted to see more dark/brown skin women on the beach so they could have a BIP love story but they won’t be there.
I don’t get the Gabi hype. I find her very mid in terms of bachelor contestants as a whole. Tbh I think there are many bachelor seasons she wouldn’t even make hometowns in.
It’s annoying when people say “if you listened to what they actually said…”. I’m commenting on the information presented to me in the thread. Why would I go listen to a two hour podcast and search for info before commenting on said thread? Be mad at the OP, not those responding to their thread.
I don’t get the Kaity hype. She’s nice, yeah…but like I don’t get it.
I think casting only 30+ would be boring at best (assuming 30s = "mature") and kinda pathetic at worst.
The obsession with hating/“snarking” on Maddie is so fucking lame. People say its because she holds harmful beliefs to hide the fact that they get a weird joy from hating/piling on a woman and have realized they can do it here and be cheered on instead of called out. Mocking the narrow and puritanical views of someone who was on a reality tv dating show four years ago and who’s obviously been indoctrinated and brainwashed since birth isn’t doing anything to fight against/refute the dangers of evangelicalism.  Edit: I think I hear the sound of hit dogs hollering 😂
This fan base is unreal. Just because someone gets into a “cute relationship” does not excuse they have done shitty things.
I didn’t understand the Barbie Charity post or the TikTok of Zach’s women saying who they think will get the drunkest. Never felt so old but glad at the same time. Am thankful social media wasn’t really around until I was an adult.
Michelle getting obliterated over her weird charity website versus Katie getting supported and coddled for selling cringey content - ask yourself why.
Before you comment “your brain isn’t even developed until 25!” on any post debating age gaps, please take a page from Brooklyn and consider shutting the fuck up. It’s a condescending oversimplification
The double standard on this sub with regards to age gaps is insane. Natalie and Nick and Kenny and Mari have the same age gap but somehow this sub is only disgusted by Nick and Natalie’s.  Is it the age gap you don’t like or Nick??   And I don’t even like Nick but damn the double standards are unreal.
It is not progressive to mock two consenting adults for willingly entering into a relationship in which they are both happy. It is not progressive to call that relationship "gross", "undesirable", "weird", "icky", "🤮", "sad", "creepy", or say it makes you "uncomfortable", "want to throw up", or that you would "never do that".  If you don't want to date someone with a 20 year age gap, don't. That doesn't mean you should shame or belittle two strangers for being in a happy and healthy relationship.
Yeah and somehow the women always ended up shamed for all of it even though the man is at least 50% of the issue.
I feel like those commenters are very young.
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
"My comment wasn't even mean (it always is), I was just calling them out for what they did!" Okay, and why do you feel that you are entitled to "call out" a total stranger and have them not react? They are not the weird or sad ones for blocking people who feel compelled to seek them out and lecture them on their behavior, especially months or years after the show. They are people, not punching bags.
Getting blocked generally means that the blockee was being an asshole. Usually there’s some disconnect with them recognizing that though.
The sound effects don’t bother me, unless they go on for too long, but my god the impressions are like nails on a chalk board
So funny. I love the podcast so much and have listened for the last few years but I truly wish there were an option to mute all effects!
I love it— but can definitely understand why it’s not everyone’s cup of tea
this is why i could never get into it lol, the first ep i listened to years ago they did a racist mexican accent and that plus the sound effects were too much for me
I love the weird voices and the obnoxious effects - they crack me up and my experience would not be as enjoyable without these tidbits.
It's also about where people find themselves in life, irrespective of age. GSJ/Serena and Kenny/Mari all met as reality show contestents who had the financial means to pause their lives and careers to do the show. Age gaps, sure, but each partner is on relatively equal footing.  There's almost no way for an 18 year old to be on equal footing with someone in their 40s.
Man GSG seems older than he is
Agree, I don’t really see any similarities between the two couples. For one, Kaity was upset about the FS drama, but not enough to leave. She seemed to work past it pretty quickly and accepted the proposal enthusiastically. Also, Zach has seemed way less online than Clayton during the airing, which has got to be better for them post-show.
Yea I think they're pretty different. Kaity was never really going to turn down Zach vs Susie even within the show bubble didn't ever seem all in on Clayton - she had more of a "shocked/oh shit" reaction than a happy one when Clayton told her he loved her. I think the similarity is mainly that Kaity and Susie are both likable F1s.
Yea I don’t get it. Kaity would date Zach if they met at a bar. Susie would not have dated Clayton if they met off tv
I was honestly really confused when Clayton was pursuing Susie and I'm a spoiled watcher. I don't remember if his winner was spoiled or not though. I think it was said he ended alone, but I just didn't get what he saw in Susie since he seemed to have way more chemistry with Rachel. Obviously Susie is a catch too but he seemed to have blinders on her being a perfect woman vs her actually being the right one for him. I don't think she was that into him but gave him a shot maybe to save face.  Kaity and Zach are a very believable couple to me. They both seem very into each other too.
And I’m the opposite! I feel like Susie chose to give Clayton another chance and honestly probably lost bachelorette forever because of it. With the absolute garbage men gabby and Rachel were subjected to I think she dodged a bullet. I think kaity and Zach and are too new to tell.
I think it’s funny when people act like we saw exactly how everything played out. Like the outrage over the Logan Covid thing, and how they didn’t tell everyone!!!!! I’m sure they told everyone off camera? Lol
Ariel admitted she never fully opened up on camera.
Ariel is playing a part IMO but if Gabi was acting, she should literally pursue a career in Hollywood.
Said this last week. They are actors
people in this sub project onto her because she doesn't look like she's gotten visible work done, has brown hair, and is snarky. being jewish and from NY in a show where mostly southern Christian women also helps.
It’s group think  It happens every season. There has to be an obsession.
Are people calling her exotic because she's Jewish?
She had some very well put together (expensive?) East Coast style outfits.
I said this a while back, but I think it’s because she’s appears to be a throwback to earlier contestants who were just working professionals who just happened to be photogenic. Like that hot dental assistant who will go on The Bachelor/ette, get eliminated Week 3, maybe have 15 minutes of fame, but will be back in the dental office within a year with no real change in their life.   As opposed to now where you have a whole ecosystem where you can create a whole new life/identity/income source for yourself solely because you went on the show.
I totally agree and what’s more is I don’t even understand the criticism? It’s the same quip every time (“if that thread is any indication, people here aren’t qualified to give any advice 🤣🤣”) and idk if anyone’s actually reading the thread, but it’s overwhelmingly just like small miscommunications and “would you consider this a red flag” type stuff. I don’t get the hate for it lol. Maybe it’s just the fact that this sub won’t let a joke die no matter the circumstances
Also I got downvoted into the negatives when I asked for advice on if I was acting irrationally towards a friend when my grandpa died. I definitely was being irrational but like damn my grandpa died the day before that, there’s no needs for the downvotes just because I didn’t have the perfect emotional response.
It bums me out too. People are sharing in a space they feel comfortable to be open and seek advice. It's cruel to take shots over it.
I agree, seeing the snark guarantees I will never feel safe to comment there lol
Yeah those posts started getting waaayyy less interaction when people started leaving comments in other posts mocking them
Yeah, it’s a shame. It’s been noticeably a lot quieter. For a sub that takes on a holier than thou attitude and likes to act above all, yikes.
As someone who frequents both r/TheBachelor and other dating subs, I think the relationships thread is pretty great for this sub. Because we have the space to drop the “shitposting Bachelor fan” mode for a second to talk about dating and relationships, as opposed to being on a sub where it’s the main thing. Because contrary to popular belief, Bachelor fans are people too.
People are also super judgmental of callers on the advice episodes of Viall Files. They’ll be like “imagine calling Nick Viall for help with your problem 💀”.
I shared something there once (about a friend related issue) and got really nasty responses. I completely regretted even posting a comment in the first place. And IRL was totally fine with the actual friends involved. People are really harsh in that thread.
The “glory days of actually eligible bachelors” were also the times that relationships with the F1 lasted like a month. Jesse Palmer picked a 22yo woman, gave her a promise ring instead of proposing, and they broke up a few weeks after the finale. Jason Mesnick was the first to end up with anyone at all from the show in season 13(!!). A lot of the early bachelors are STILL single 15-20 years later. Being a catch on paper doesn’t mean someone is a good partner or interested in a relationship.
More than this, I need everyone posting about how ugly the male leads are to post pics of all the guys they’ve dated. To pretend like these aren’t *objectively attractive* people is a waste of time
I feel like the pick for bachelor is usually fine (ITA Matt, Peter, even Clayton were all catches by normal standards) but I feel like the bigger problem is the guys they cast for the bachelorette.   Like last season Rachel was a pilot, Gabby was a nurse and an NFL cheerleader - these are objectively beautiful independent women with respectable careers and who did they cast for them? A magician, twin club promoters, at least two unemployed guys with no real goals for the future, it’s insulting lol.
They say conventional, but really they want the Tyler C's. The standards for men are much higher around here.
This sub will find fault with any and every lead (since we are all humans with flaws) and therefore will never be happy with any of them, particularly the men.
I actually think the overwhelming majority of hetero women here would happily date Zach if they had the chance. There’s just a lot of projection. The Bachelors somehow represent all the men who did ppl wrong; so the users here direct unwarranted hate towards them from afar.
> Barack Obama?  would love an obama season
Some people call decent men mediocre in an attempt to overcompensate for the inequality women have faced over the years, but that’s really not the way forward, lol. It comes off as excessively bitter and spiteful. Tearing down men ≠ uplifting women.
Susie didn’t care about the sex. She never liked Clayton and she used it as an excuse to leave 😂 but yeah I see your point.
There’s definitely a correlation between that thread and all the projection that happens
Probably why so many people project their exes on the men of the franchise
10 paragraph manifestos about a 3 date situationship from Hinge.....no wonder they take these fake engagements and 2 week long relationships so seriously. It makes me so glad I'm not 20 anymore.
And some of the men hyped from this franchise that are glaring f bois
Someone posts a variation of this every week in this thread. and I find it to be pretty mean spirited and 100% wrong
Also one of the biggest discussion points about Nick and Natalie's relationship is that it's gross because having such a large age gap when one partner is so young creates an unethical power dynamic. And if Nick is in fact a creep who's taking advantage of her immaturity, why on earth would your response be to spew vitriol about \*her\*? I'm ambivalent to Natalie but more often than not I find myself wanting to defend her because the way people talk about her is so far over the line.
Most reality show subreddits are extremely misogynistic. There's always a weirdly excited vibe too like people are thrilled to finally openly trash women and have other women support it 🤷‍♀️
Some of the most disgustingly misogynistic things I’ve ever read have been on this sub in posts about either Natalie or other women people have decided its fine to have open season on.
Completely agree. You could literally have copied and pasted half of these comments from a [tame] MAGA sub about gay marriage.
LOL! I thought the same thing! I was like what in the Handmaid’s tale is going on?
I agree about Madi, but, to be completely honest, I don't mind because I'm borderline obsessed with her husband. He's so... fascinating, to me. "My goodness 50 looks fire on you" pops into my head every couple of hours.
The Madi stuff is funny because so much of it seems like hate engagement. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a post about Madi from someone who’s a fan of hers, so it’s like…..you keep up with someone you hate? Weirdo behavior if you ask me.
I agree it’s odd. Does she even mention the show anymore or even come around BN? I don’t understand the fanbase focusing on people that moved on with their life after the show. Madi wasn’t even an f1 and never went on BIP and is married to a man outside the franchise.
I really need everyone to stop bashing her house idc if you thought it was boring she clearly likes that style. It doesn't even look bad, imo it's well designed except for maybe one of the console tables.
Lol this sub sounds like a bunch of Karens. TikTok is fun and not nearly as serious as this sub thinks it is.
Being a single guy and acting like it means "they aren't ready for marriage" to folks here. How exactly does a single person act ready for marriage?
This is just wrong and I don’t like Greg. He had a stanbase that chewed Katie up and then was in a relationship instead of going on BIP where he would’ve been a main attraction then Victoria   Also I’ve seen that group be praised and get passes other men don’t and as a WOC I think this fanbase has been giving out passes to MOC since Black Lives Matter and oddly left out passes to WOC as if men are all that matter   If nayte was white, playing Michelle would’ve been a bigger deal and cruelly dumping her over the phone to run around with women with her f4. No one is calling for white f1s who played their leads to come to bip. Michelles feelings are disregarded because she’s not a Hannah b. Same for Rodney if he was white and left a gf back home AND had friends who publicly attacked the woman he dated on the show on social media there would be no calls for him to be bachelor. They are being coddled and a lot by black women which is odd because they don’t even like us  Justin and Andrew should get even more heat for their hateful, colorist remarks that have largely been dismissed but Andrew has people cheering for him to be bachelor too even after not taking the women on bip seriously and his continued asinine remarks on women and dating   White men on reality tv get flamed for hiding girlfriends far worse than these dudes
I love LiB in the pods and Mexico and think it's really boring after that.
The most recent season of LIB has been trash though lol. I will say the LIB sub is a scarily misogynistic place - people actually take Shake's side over Deepti's.
LIB had one good season (S1). It’s been down hill since then for me.  Trying to get into the most recent season but can’t.
It’s my favorite dating reality show hands down. Bachelor could never compare
I don’t think this is unpopular. People are always talking about how much better LiB and FBoy island is than the bachelor.
This is how I feel about temptation island, rather than love is blind. It’s kind of ruined bachelor for me because it is so much better
no hate but I do think this is perhaps the most popular opinion on this sub
Flip side , I don’t think she’s going to marry him :)
How long have they been engaged for now?
I've never gotten misogynistic or racist undertones from them? Genuinely curious about what you're referring to
Not to mention the same people straight up fawning over Reality Steve. At least Nick never launched an online rumor/slut shaming campaign against a woman, based on unverified sources, that essentially ruined her life for years.
I like spoilers once the show is airing. But it confuses me how people have favorites before it's even started. I guess some cast members sound good on paper but it always seems like half of the favorites are gone before week 2 just because they don't click with the lead.
Some people enjoy the sleuthing more than the actual show. I personally don't care to sleuth but I love having all the spoilers beforehand because it changes the viewing experience. To each their own!
I like being spoiled as in knowing who the lead picks. HOWEVER, I find knowing everything about the contestants past, the dates, etc are way less important. It’s too much energy for this tv show for me lol.
I usually go unspoiled; I remember during Hannah’s season this sub was going insane with all the Jed stuff, and I had serious FOMO. So I went spoiled for Peter’s season and I honestly didn’t really enjoy it. Granted, that season was a messy one and no one really knew what was happening after filming. But I haven’t gone spoiled since. I found there was just too much with which to keep up.   I completely agree about going surgical on contestants. I always skip those podcast episodes where they go through cast bios.
I agree digging into contestants social media and everything is weirdo behavior, but as to spoiling in general: unspoiled means I’m entertained while the show airs. Spoiled entertains the entire off season too. Even with spoilers it’s still fun to watch and see exactly how it plays out/how it’s edited/etc
Agree! It’s already borderline unwatchable it’s so boring, I don’t see how people search out spoilers/info. It’s the only part that keeps me going
I agree with you I think it would be a lot less fun to watch if I already knew what was going to happen. But at the same time I get that people get antsy with major bachelor withdrawals in the off season and have to read about it.
This is true, but what if they want to be friends? They had a friendship on the show and they want to continue that.
In regular life, I’d say it’s stupid to try to be friends but I think because the show is technically just a few weeks of filming and they spend a lot of time apart from the lead, it’s probably easier to move on from in the end. Obviously there’s that layer of rehashing feelings when watching it back but even then, it’s not like it was a “true” relationship.
Here’s my UO. I don’t think Tyler C is attractive 😂
Attractiveness is subjective. There is no such thing as "conventionally attractive." I actually don't find Zach or Tyler attractive at all. Everyone has different tastes!
I feel like there are certain users that are obsessed with hating on specific contestants and they’re almost triggered when anyone is nice to them… and that’s when you know you should get a grip tbh lol. You don’t have to like everyone, but you shouldn’t be literally so upset when people are nice to them
Yeah, it drives me nuts also. And you know if the thread was negative the people complaining would have just chimed right in adding to the toxicity!
Upvoted for truly unpopular imo
Nah you’re not lol. Since the finale people have been mostly positive about her because of everything that happened and how she handled herself but I feel like all season long people were calling her annoying.
I agree - to be fair I have seen this sentiment a fair amount on the sub but she DOES seem really calculated. It was Weird and somewhat backhanded to say that she only stayed so Kaity wouldn't feel like a second choice, I was surprised so many people were a fan of that
Trust, in a sub of our magnitude, you will likely never be the only one feeling some way about something. Also to anyone wondering “does anyone else” - the answer is likely yes, someone else does. Someone should chime in with the psychology on this (confirmation bias?) about why you may be focusing on pro-Gabi content. I think there’s been plenty critique of her!
I don’t understand why people care that much and get so offended on Madi’s behalf. She used the show to launch her Christian influencing career. We still gossip/talk about contestants that were on the show way longer than 3 years ago (not to mention that PP’s season was one of the last seasons where contestants still had the ability to gain millions of followers).     People weren’t saying anything that bad, it was just confusing that she was harping on the importance of “dressing modestly” when she was selling normal two-pieces and doesn’t dress that modestly herself 🤷‍♀️    I find the Madi threads entertaining. It’s not that hard to understand why a lot of people do. Yet the “y’all need to leave Madi alone”, “y’all are obsessed with Madi and it’s gross”, “Madi was on the show so long ago!” opinions will continue
I’m guessing this might be an indirect at me! I am not above snarking at all and participate heavily in other snark subs— I’m just not delusional enough to think it’s because I don’t care haha. It stopped being BN related a long time ago
wait Gabi from this past season?
Idk, I didn't think she'd make it as far on Zach's season as she did and she went all the way to F2. Shoot your shot Gabi!
Is Aly mixed? From her IG post on 10/23/17, it looks like both her parents are Black.
I disagree because this show doesn’t cast men who date monoracial black women. Unless charity has some but previous seasons of bip didn’t have any so they would just be used for tv time and ig posts until dropped  like many monoracial black women have who ended up with black or biracial men on tv who didn’t date black women in real life
It's clear she and Zach had chemistry. I don't think she would have made it as far with other recent bachelors. Between Kat, Greer, Christina Mandrell, Brianna along with Ariel and Charity, there were a lot of options a different lead could have picked for F2.
This is a weird comment. The people that make hometowns are the ones that lead has feelings for (or an individual that production asks the lead to bring along for some reason). I wouldn't expect every lead to consistently be in love with one specific BN contestant.
In the age of misinformation, click bait posts are toxic and people who only read the one liners without looking into the context is part of the problem
This is how I feel about Gabi lol
Pathetic?
I dunno because Love Is blind is mostly 30+ or late 20s and that show has way more drama and entertainment than the Bachelor imo.
I don’t think it needs to be 30+, just marriage age. I know there are always outliers but generally speaking, 23 year olds are not trying to get married lol. I think if they cast people who are a little older the stakes would be higher and we’d get more legit drama vs bullshit like shrimpgate.
You must be young because people in their 30’s can be just as dramatic or more so.
i don't like madi, but i saw her snark page and it was both lame and unhinged. the same user posted the same exact thread multiple times with a slightly different title each time until they got some discussion. don't you......have literally anything better to do?
To add to it, I think ppl portray Madi as more radical in her beliefs than she actually is (or was - I wonder if there's a shift now with her career and marriage). Even her waiting for marriage, that's her choice, and when she's talks about it's clearly her preaching to the choir (i.e, ppl who have similar views/made that decision).
I’m always shocked at how many comments those posts get too, I’ve never had an opinion on Madi and I don’t seek out her content so it’s surprising that so so many people seem to wait for her to post something to snark about
Honestly it simply reinforces the evangelical persecution fantasy and changes nothing. If this sub actually cared about change they'd try to change the system. Instead they waste time being performative by going after one low level individual (same as they ignored Mike Fleiss for 20+ years).
Zach was shitty to his f2… like okay? He didn’t do anything truly terrible or racist, etc his actions were also on a heavily edited TV show where you have to dump someone at the end. I’m sorry but I’m truly lost at some of y’all acting like we should want to burn Zach and Kaity at the stake 💀💀 Kaity is yes probably helping Zach get love sooner than he otherwise would but also… it’s not that serious lol
No, but I also don’t think people should be judged based off of one incident. We all make mistakes and we learn and we grow.
Or, hear me out - sometimes people just want to post relevant content about certain people and not talk about a televised fight from 5 years ago that all parties involved have moved on from.
Who are u talking about?
Im just jaded but people do this every time when there’s a new couple. All of the sudden everyone is supposed to love the two people — then once they breakup in 6 months we’re allowed to dislike (usually the man) again.  Generally I’m just so confused bc people always say “now this couple might make it” and list very mundane reasons, when the same has been said for the last 15 couples 🙈 Are y’all new here?
The Barbie thing was a meme happening in other subs for various content
Selling feet pics is funny. Half of the comments are people saying they'd do the same. Why the hell would you not let someone pay for your pedicure and a photo of your feet, and use the money to pay off your mom's house?
I find Katie selling foot pics to be every bit as cringe as that site where Johnny was selling dating tips and Lace was giving fashion advice. Much different sub reactions, though.
You do mean the feet pics right? I’m not trying to share my thoughts on that in here lol
The sub is a textbook example of cognitive dissonance
I think they’re viewed differently because Mari was a bit older than Natalie when the relationship started
But they don’t have the same age gap. And Mari was like 25 when they started dating. Natalie was a random 19 year old on Instagram when she started hanging out with Nick.  At least get the facts straight.
I dislike Nick and enjoy talking shit about him at any opportunity, yet I’ve refrained from age gap posts because it’s all been said and done. I’m not here to bash him and Natalie on age gaps, or engage on child bride jokes. I can see why some people talk about the age gap though, it brings a broader discussion about power imbalances in the real world.
An age gap when the youngest is 25 is very different than an age gap when someone is 19. The maturity changes and growth between those two ages are soooo extreme.
If Nick had met Natalie when she was a little older it would be less of an issue. However they were talking before they even started dating and she was 21 when they started to date. It is a bit creepy vs if she was 24 when they met and decided to get together. I mean I knew friends at 17 dating 23 year olds and even at 17 I thought it was weird and gross and wondered why the 23 year old couldnt find a gf around his age. I did not think it was cool my friend was dating an older guy nor did my friend group. Now if they had been 23 and 29, no its not a big deal, but there is a difference at those very young ages where people can be taken advantage of and it becomes questionable why someone that much older was hanging around such younger women.   Also people did point out the age gaps on BIP but at least there they were all cast together vs Joe and Kenny just going out and finding younger women to date.
I personally find Mari to be much more mature than Natalie, and Kenny more mature than Nick. Their age gap seems less apparent.
Trust me it’s not the age gap, they just don’t like Nick so everything he does is a problem.
I agree! I think both are gross.
Half the point of this sub is to discuss other people’s relationships and not all opinions are going to be positive. It’s literally a discussion forum, not an outlet to sing praises and positivity.  Also it is weird and creepy that a 40 year old pursued a 20 year old.
As long as I’m breathing I will mock any man in his 30s and up who pursues a teenage girl 💁🏻‍♀️
Shockingly some people don’t think a healthy relationship exists when a nearly 40 year old is going after someone who can’t even buy a beer on your date
Ok but who’s gonna stop me if I do decide to shame them
And they go on for soooo long! Why am I listening to these grown ass adults badly imitate GSJ and Nick Viall for entire conversations? Why do they think anyone wants that? It’s unbearable lol.
Genuinely surprised by this take but I’m glad it’s working for somebody lol.
I feel like Susie and Clayton would have gone on a couple dates then decided to just be friends lol
I wonder if them realizing the way producers had interfered in their relationship made them feel like they were supposed to be together, without realizing that there were other reasons why they weren’t compatible.
Most of the chemistry was stuff initiated by Rachel though. The whisper talking whenever they were together, cutting him off to make out with him. Rachel would probably have insane chemistry with any guy tbh. And chemistry doesn’t necessarily mean that person is the right one for you  You also have to keep in mind that lot of Clayton/Susie scenes were cut. The prouwanted people to think it was Rachel so that the final episodes, and the fact that it was Susie Clayton wanted, would come as a huge shock
Yes
are we even sure Ariel was a working professional? She was billed as a Marketing Executive but from her instagram seems to be traveling every week so i'm not sure what she was actually doing because if you seriously worked a 9-5 as a marketing exec you would not have that much PTO.
Okay, thank you. I read that thread every week and it's almost always completely normal situations and/or venting that anyone who's ever dated has probably been through at some time or another. I feel like a lot of the people who get critical about it probably are either 1) not reading it or 2) met their husband in like college or something and have zero experience with what those posters are talking about.
oh I replied to your comment! I hope you're doing better, I will never down vote in the relationship thread, but yeah it bums me out when people go in there and down vote when people are looking for advice and are vulnerable enough to be sharing their story.   and then you can't win because you call out the downvotes and you just get downvoted more lol
Totally agree. This sub does seem like it would be a safer sub to share on, but it’s not. I’ve been fooled before thinking it would be ok to share a personal experience here 🤷‍♀️.
So are bachelor contestants, but that doesn't stop the sub from treating them the way they do
> A magician, twin club promoters, at least two unemployed guys with no real goals for the future, it’s insulting lol.  What about the rest of the men? They always cast a variety of backgrounds, it's more fun that way.
My wife finds him physically attractive but some of his personality quirks off-putting
Just pictured a chorus of women at his WTA sarcastically yelling "THANKS, OBAMA!!"
Malia is 24!
Ok so are we just ignoring the rest of the comment and all the other things that make him objectively a good bachelor on paper?
If this were true she never would have dated him in the real world. She'd have been a lot better off sticking to her decision, he brought down her brand until she rehabbed his and being with him ruined her chances of being Bachelorette or going on Paradise. There's no real benefit to her staying with him and certainly not for as long as she did, she did HIS image a favor.
![gif](giphy|3ohhwtQ3U0wsyytaIU|downsized)
That just reminded me of someone posting something about their ideal bachelor candidate in another thread and it was like every f boi or men that have displayed a pattern of misogynistic behaviors in bachelor nation
Exactly, none of the “concern” is genuine because the top comments on posts related to her are always rehashing the same tired age gap jokes  So, you find the age gap problematic, gross, unsettling, etc. but your first thought is to spew misogynistic vitriol at her and crack daughter jokes at her expense….how does that work?
Yeah the age gap skeeves me out. But that’s all on him. He’s the one who it becomes problematic for.
That’s a great point. In all other scenarios the younger person is a victim but not in this one? People make a special exception for her and say the nastiest shit
 "My goodness 50 looks fire on you" pops into my head every couple of hours.   LMAO. That post ("god is all over you let him work") made me want to jump out of my skin.
they are pretty unintentionally hilarious
He’s my favorite bach nation spouse I fear
I think this about all the snark subs and stuff. Why do people spend their time engaging if they hate the person so much?!
I thought the house was fugly as hell tbh but also like not sure what people expected of course it’s expensive and soulless
The thread about her house was just weird too. So many people frothing at the mouth about how they heard it’s not in her name and how funny it is that if they get divorced she’ll have nothing.
Idk what passes you’re thinking of honestly, Nayte was pretty disproportionately criticized to anything he actually did. Which was just to end a toxic relationship. Clearly the problem wasn’t lack of commitment or refusal to move to her considering that they live in the same city now and still don’t want to be together 🤷🏻‍♀️
Idk what sub you’ve been on but Nayte is dragged just for breathing. I also don’t understand how he “played” Michelle, but sure let’s continue to paint one party as the “victim” when we have zero context as to how that relationship actually played out.
to be fair, I think it's pretty fair to say that Susie is a white F1 who played her lead, and people have been calling for her to be Bachelorette, not even just on Paradise
> This is just wrong.  Its not. Its just a different opinion/perspective from yours.   Greg would have had to disappear completely after his season if not for Andrew and Justin. Posting on his own would have just flamed the talk about him being a clout chaser. The only way he could turn the narrative around and seem likable was to pop up in Andrew and Justin’s posts but otherwise lay low.   Any guy who has a bad break up gets heat. Jed/Arie/Tino/Greg/Dale/Peter. But unlike them, Nayte didn’t cheat on Michelle, swap her out for another woman, have a huge fight with her on tv or have a secret girlfriend. He just didn’t want to date her anymore, which isn’t a crime.   This sub routinely defends Blake H’s right to hook up with/pursue at least four of the women who would be on his season of BIP weeks/months before filming and to try to profit from the use of the franchise’s intellectual property in his DJ sets. But Andrew/Justin/Nayte/Rodney can’t not have public girlfriends and attend events in LA?  I said I don’t really care for any of them, and Andrew and Justin’s colorist remarks are a big part of it. But I also know bias when I see it.
Same. And them spacing out the release of the episodes makes me even less likely to watch all the boring meet the family/friends eps
Don't get started on Cole and Zaneb
I enjoy selective discussions there but especially earlier in the season the rhetoric surrounding Micah's and Irina's looks was disgusting. There's also a lot of not-so-subtle racism in the way people talk about Jackie. And they're obsessed with Zack, who is absolutely going to turn out to be yet another NiceGuy.  I'm loving this season though! So much drama, and Tiffany and Brett to cleanse the palate.
The amount of Shake stanning on that sub needs to be studied 🥴
How far into it are you? I think this is my second favorite season after the first one, the previous one wasn't great and the one before was fine but not as good. So far I really like the current season though, mix of wacky drama and a couple (or maybe two) that I think might actually make it.
Omg, I can barely get through this season too 😭 idk what it is exactly but I'm having trouble getting into it
I don’t know. I get downvoted when I post it
I agree. Her work comes first
![gif](giphy|99P7jBfNjo2Tm)
I think next month marks 2 years.
ty for asking earnestly because i think it’s been buried so well that a lot of people aren’t aware!! the male cohost of GOR has a well-documented history of being horrible towards women — there are too many examples and arguments for me to list here rn but if you search “Chad Kultgen” in this subreddit i think it’s been discussed before. he only apologized after listeners found out his real name, and even then it was a pretty shit apology. a lot of people like to make (invalid!!) excuses for him or turn a blind eye because they appreciate the way he analyzes the show. personally, i’m not down to hear takes on the bachelor — a program that’s primarily for and about women — from any dude who doesnt seem to like women very much
This!  I don’t like the digging into their history and definitely not family and friends.  But I love trying to figure out what happened when and how it plays out.  Especially the edits like for example it was fun knowing the LCDs were shown in the opposite order for drama this year.  It’s also fun to watch for SHVs post show.  Those have many times spoiled the season before RS or anyone else can, or confirm their spoilers.  Like HB SHV never made sense for Tyler,  so I was never shocked by the change in spoiler.  Same with Des
👆👆👆
>There is no such thing as "conventionally attractive."   lmao
Theyre probably the same ones posting stuff to incite pile ons and then getting off on it
That comment was honestly really weird but I think it tells you more about Gabi than it does about Kaity- Gabi is actually pretty insecure and might've felt that way, that she'd "won" by default if the other F2 contestant left. Or it's just revisionist history- I really think she stayed because a tiny part of her even still, thought Zach might choose her.
They get a lot of interaction cause most of us are fucking sick of hypocritical shitty holier than thou Christians who cause more harm than good
It's about you and the many many other comments I've seen exactly like it on this thread. So many former  contestants get posted about on this sub and the post has nothing to do with BN that's not exclusive to Madi.
Yes!
Gabi looks nothing like the girls Tyler has dated post show. He loves his blondes.
Looks like she is fully black and I did not know that. it’s nice to see and I hope she’s invited to BIP.
Thanks she looked full black to me and I truly hope she declines the invite until they improve casting
This show doesn’t cast men that date anything other than white women but that doesn’t mean that other races shouldn’t be casted. That’s like saying just because the lead doesn’t date Asian women that Asian women shouldn’t be on the show. All races should get the opportunity and then maybe they can go on BIP and meet their person.
No, but there are IMO some contestants that would make the f4 on the majority of leads seasons. I don’t think Gabi is one of those.
I second this. Especially because Zach isn’t a catch himself lol, she could do much better
Same. A lot of the women this season were very meh personality wise 🤷🏾‍♀️
Basically, yes. With the format and sometimes silly tone of this show, this show would be kinda pathetic if the cast is majority 30+. Plus, there would undoubtedly be so much more talk about how "old" they're getting and how much more "wife material" they are on the Bachelor.
I don't think comparisons to shows like LiB work bc The Bachelor is a last-man-standing competition. In LiB, you follow multiple couples.
Casting for the last 2 seasons weren't so bad. There was only one token 23 year old on Clayton's season (Sarah H) and on Zach's season (Jess) lol. Everyone else was 24+. But Matt, Peter and Colton had wayyyy too many 23 year olds lol
I'm not saying that (hence the parentheses), but since it's so often implied here, then with it, it would make for a boring show.
It’s legit like just one person who does all the posts on that sub too.
They don't, that's the problem. Or they are miserable in their own lives, and it makes them feel better to shit on others.
I hadn't heard about this sub until recently and it strikes me as very weird behavior to have an entire forum dedicated to hating on one person. At that point it's bordering on obsession.
I think she was always pretty radical in her beliefs, but I don’t think shes as judgmental of others are some people believe.   I vaguely remember her mentioning around Peters season that they would always have to get separate hotel rooms if they traveled together.
Currently, all the Zach stans or more likely Kaity stans sticking up for Zach.   Others, might include Dean/Caelynn, GSJ (extension of Serena), etc..
Apparently I’m new here considering the downvotes. 😂 I didn’t know I couldn’t give my opinion on an open discussion board.
That makes me feel even better that I’m not online enough to know this, lmao
I don’t generally care what Katie does. I care that people support this while slamming others for the same or less without an ounce of recognition of the bias.
Yes, but Mari is also liked. As is Kenny! I think people would have been more sceptical if she was younger when they met on BIP but I don’t think the amount of HATE would be even close to nick/natalie
they also don't have the same age gap - 18 years is about 20% more than 15 years (definitely nitpicking here and I made my own UO comment about the age gaps but it's not "the same" age gap)
Only this sub would have me defending God damn evangelicals and Nick Viall. "Snark" is just another word for bullying but people get super defensive about it because no one wants to recognize they are what they despise.
I turned down a 19 year old woman when I was 25 because she was too young!
She pursued him at 19 soo guess this one is okay
The fun police s/
![gif](giphy|3otOKTjlqkF3C1XhFm)
Haha I’m glad you asked! They just banter the same way me and my friends do so I feel very hashtag represented.
Susie would have maybe given him one date and even that is a stretch for me
I didn’t think Rachel had much chemistry with any of the men on her season.
Yeahh, I don't like openly shitting on the relationship thread, but there is a bit of "can't take what you dish" here sometimes.
Or the women standing on a balcony/bridge/whatever and excitedly screaming “Barack!!!!” for a promo
I disagree! Being a couple post finale even the hated ones gain lot of Clout. You get the people magazine photoshoot, multiple podcast interviews, GMA appearance, more Tv interviews and the most imp of all, the IG followers! Susie looked like a bachelorette candidate until RCFH! Dont think they would make Susie bachelorette over Gabby Rachel so she choose the next route for gaining clout.
Lol Oh yes I responded to that comment in disbelief  They make me question whether my standards are too high but then I remember I date and know men in real life who you know meet my very basic requirements for a mate over 26. I let a lot slide for 25 and under but the men named were pushing 30 or over exhibiting fresh out of college frat boy behaviors and they are deserving of 30 women to play with on tv. Absolutely not
Agreed, but also: my mom turns 50 in a couple years and if my partner doesn't post "my goodness 50 looks fire on you" for her, we're breaking up.
There's nothing else to talk about in this sub.  Oh the influencer posted an ad on ig!  All the weird shit Madi is doing is far more interesting for an online community of anonymous losers
I guess im curious what you thought was ugly about it? I didn't like the wood finish of the desk/entry way table but other than that its just very boring and unoffensive, but it's definitely what is trendy now for beige influencers who are into this design.
it's like hints of misogyny too, like Madi can't be successful on her own. Like she will never be billionaire status but I have no doubt she could afford a nice house in Waco if she wanted to without grants money.
Yeah seriously, Nayte has been dragged to hell and back here and we literally don't even know what exactly went down in their relationship/breakup. People are just super defensive of Michelle because she said she was hurt and assumed that he did something fucked up. It sounds like they both had grievances and the relationship just wasn't working from early on. He's a weird one to pick as an example of someone getting "passes." The man can't even post a corny TikTok without getting 200 comments about what a fuckboi he is.
Lol the pile on about his TikTok was hysterical. He was literally just doing a random TikTok trend and everyone that doesn't understand TikTok decided he was incredibly immature and shading Michelle and lost their minds
That’s not true at all. He has plenty of defenders and they’ve come at me since I said he was wrong reasons when Michelle’s season was airing. He has always had fan girls
I’m referring to men. Also Susie and Clayton were also not engaged and didn’t have a traditional ending and at least tried. Nayte did not and he proposed and got a down payment on a house in Minnesota. Susie and Clayton also had an amicable split and are still friends. Just did a colab actually. and I certainly haven’t heard about susie going on trips picking up men with gabby and Rachel
I feel like you’re dead wrong about Greg lol. This sub celebrated Greg day for no reason other than to antagonize Katie Thurston. Greg got propped up regardless of Andrew and Justin because it got on her nerves.
Just at proposals.  I will keep watching next week
Nah, it's gonna be his decision. He doesn't want a wedding! This isn't speculation, this is fact! He doesn't want a small wedding, he wants a big wedding, but he wants to pay small wedding prices. How is it gonna happen then Mr. Finance Bro??
Hmm I mean I see where you're coming from but I knew this and personally disagree - from what I've read about them, my thought on his prior books (which iirc were the subject of the issue) was that they are fictional and meant to be exaggerated examples of asshole behavior. The books sound shocking and it's uncomfortable to imagine that men around you think that way.   Imo the books are an exaggeration - I didn't need an apology, nor did I feel duped about his identity or books, and I still like the show. I'd figured out his name from offhand comments on the show pretty easily and looked him up before that thread happened. From what I remember about that thread/GOR's apology is that Chad apologized for potentially misleading people or seeming like he was hiding despite that not having been the intent, not the content of his books, and imo there's not really a need to apologize for the content
I just wanted to clarify that I’m not above snark or I wouldn’t be here haha. I def agree other contestants get posted about, it just feels like there are 10 instances where it’s madi for every 1 post where it isn’t
oh that’s so random! how do you know she likes Tyler? sorry if this is kinda common knowledge this is just the first time I’m hearing of it lol
I disagree that monoracial black women should be put on a dating show with men who aren’t interested in them  Fix the casting all around   I support monoracial black women going on the main show for the perks only and then accepting lead but BIP should be avoided. I don’t see any gain for them on that beach with this casting pool. There are other reality shows. BIP is worst case for a full black woman
Yes. Those that would make f4 on any season are like Hannah G and Tyler C.
Funnily enough Serena was one of the youngest women on her season but I think she was the first to get married!
Not at all
How long are people supposed to care lmao yeah people definitely like cute relationships, but people also just move on
Where are these stans you speak of? Are you sure you know what that word means?  ![gif](giphy|2vlC9FMLSmqGs)
But I don’t see how they’re the same. Katie is selling a product. What is Michelle selling?
Stop. This can not be a serious comment.
> Ok so are we just ignoring the rest of the comment and all the other things that make him objectively a good bachelor on paper?
Honestly they madi hate is tame compared to what i see on the duggar snark page. I mean to me it's just weird that people watch the show just to snark on it.
I have a few different definitions of ugly haha, I agree it’s largely inoffensive on its own, I guess I more hate how corporate it feels. Just no charm whatsoever, no indication any real people with personal taste live in that home. It always bothers me to see this aesthetic but especially so when you know they have pretty much unlimited funds *and* they paid professionals to do it
I don’t particularly have a strong opinion here on this stuff, but I know there are people who tend to dislike the ‘McMansion’ new development style homes that are especially prominent in Texas. When it comes to the interior design, I personally don’t mind minimalist or ‘beige’ style decor. I have adhd so I’m kinda drawn to the concept of having no clutter haha but I think when it comes to these giant homes, it looks very cold and unfinished
Exactly. How did she miss the grippo girls? I was not a Greg fan and defended Katie so I know all about them lol if he went on bip he would’ve been the biggest male contestant on there and much bigger than Andrew or Justin or the mania when we first learned of him and Victoria   Justin is really the one who has been riding coattails. He is Andrews plus one and andrew and Rodney are the preferred diversity picks. Andrew said a few months ago he was closer to Greg than Justin. Greg just has a gf leaving those two. Justin did nothing his season and nothing on paradise. He’s never been as big as Andrew or Greg and now Andrew is left with him and justin also latches onto Rodney and nayte when Andrew is preoccupied because he isn’t popular on his own. He’s the one being dragged along.
Greg day happened before the fight was aired and before Greg was being called an abuser all over the internet. There was a petition against him being the Bachelor because of it. Seeing how much Andrew and Justin, who were relatively well liked after the season, liked him and seeing him be “goofy” and “fun” on their Tiktoks turned things around for him. There was no way he could post his own content right after the season.
She said it on a pod like a week ago and Kaitlyn brought it up to Gabi again on her pod today lol
Perfect Match was particularly awful at this
Love Island was bad about this too.  ETA: just saw your comment about this!
I mean, I think it’s the downvotes coming through. Y’all are too scared to comment and downvote instead. 😂😂   Also, you’re a possible stan for one of the ones I mentioned considering I triggered you enough to comment.
They’re both selling themselves to an extent. And it’s cringey for both. But only one is being applauded. And it’s obvious why but no one unsurprisingly seems to want to acknowledge that.
According to these people, all these old men everywhere are being seduced by teenagers and there’s nothing they can do to stop it!!!!!
It’s literally a line from every predators handbook “but she pursued ME!” As if they don’t set up the situation to have a young women pursue them so they can justify the relationship to their friends
Oh yeah it's for sure like model home vibes, she added some personality though with the made for this moment neon sign though lol.   But I'd rather have her house than my outdated ugly rental with early 2000s fixtures and yellow maple cabinetry anyday🫠
> and they paid professionals to do it  I actually think this is part of the reason it's so sterile. If they'd designed it themselves it might have a little more charm because they'd naturally pick things they just liked and wanted even if they didn't perfectly match, but if they couldn't really convey their personal taste because they don't have much, the designers are going to go with the safest and most generic options that they're sure would appeal to the most people, and that's where you get the "model home" look.
Jeez, i didn’t know this Greg point would be such a thing 😂. I’m not saying Justin or Andrew are or ever were more popular than him. Just that his image needed serious rehab after the season and his laying low while Justin and Andrew, who weren’t being called abusers and actors, posted him was the strategy that achieved that.
Greg Day happened because spoiled people that hated Katie and Michael organized a bunch of posts about Greg. They didn't want Michael to be bachelor and they wanted to hype up Greg so that when the fight happened, they'd side with him over Katie. I saw screenshots posted when it happened.
Huh? He did post his own content right after the season. And he had way more followers than both Andrew and Justin. Greg was the favorite of that bunch.
Maybe I’m misremembering it (because I don’t follow any of these people) but I feel like Greg was unpopular immediately after the fight but then it all calmed down at ATFR because Katie looked worse by comparison. He had like two weeks of thinkpieces thrown at him and then everyone promptly forgot to go back to hating on Katie.
Yep and it was awful watching Ann Sophie and colony. I don’t enjoy watching because all it does it gives me anxiety to watch these women with men who don’t date them in real life  I’m also a love island fan and I had to deal with justine and Caleb and Timmy and zeta and some on UK. These men will ignore black women or worse use them until the end and then cruelly dump them after winning/getting clout because they know the black female audience is easy to pander to   I’ve learned my lesson. I look at these men following list and real life exes and ignore what they say on camera. Most of these black/biracial men are too pr savvy to admit to their preferences so I look for myself
So, if people downvote you they're scared, and if they comment they're triggered. Is there any room in there for people who simply...disagree with you?
Good Lord, this is a deluded response. Enjoy your downvotes!
I think people were scoffing at Michelle selling herself as a motivational speaker or thinking she was more than just another typical influencer. Katie isn’t pretending that she’s changing the world with her feet pics
Won’t anyone sympathize with the 40 year old men 🥺
Exactly!
Unfortunately I think the neon signs are *especially* corporate 😂  I’m sure you’re not the only person that would trade anyway!!
I mean, sure, but that means you paid shitty professionals if that’s what they did
The single men as you know are more active. Justin and Andrew were doing bachelor events and social media to promote themselves and bip appearances. Andrew and Teddi were supposed to be stars in paradise  Greg wasn’t laying low due to fans. He was in a whole relationship and not doing BIP and therefore not promoting himself like the men set for paradise. However they were never bigger than him such that he needed to ride their coattails. They were never that big period and still aren’t which is why they moved to LA to live in a cramped rental to team up with Rodney and nayte. They need the numbers. To say Greg needed them is laughable
They wanted to hype him up but Greg day specifically was just being being silly. It was a snowball affect.
It has been hours but I feel the need to clarify lol, the women of the POC sub decided to hype Greg up in this sub because of Andrew’s offensive tweets and the fact that Michael was the only other shitty choice. This was over weeks. Greg day was just a weird sweet spot where shit posts were made and after the first couple, the sub went wild.
He didn’t even have his own TikTok until months after Andrew and Justin had been posting him on theirs and still doesn’t post as much as other BN people. He’s always going to have the abuser/clout chaser allegations hanging over him, and I think its clear he’s strategic in how he uses social media because of it, like letting his not polarizing friends post him more in the beginning.
People came around on him because he was relatively quiet and laid low for a while and Katie was being far more visible. If he’d been posting his own TikTok’s or doing anything else attention seeking, I think it would be a different story. But people were still able to see him being “fun” on Andrew and Justin’s posts.
For this argument, not really.   Someone asked me to give an example and I did. Only reason I’m getting downvoted to hell is because I listed their favorite. If they didn’t agree with me then most people will state their case and we can start a discussion. That’s not the case here so I stand by my comment.
I will, downvotes don’t bother me! Bless you sweetheart. 💜
Katie is also an aspiring professional comedian so selling feet pics is literally just setting her up for content for her comedy routine
What are they supposed to do if you give them no direction? They aren't going to be able to manufacture personal taste out of thin air, and if they make big swings it's more likely the client will dislike it. Grant and Madi seemed extremely happy with it so I'd say the professionals did a pretty good job.
I think you’re giving Greg too much credit/not seeing his strategy for maintaining a social media presence. His image is based on being someone who doesn’t want attention but also someone who somehow can’t avoid being constantly posted on social media. First it was on Andrew and Justin’s social media working the bromance angle. He doesn’t need them anymore now that he’s on Victoria’s social media being the boyfriend-guy. They all feed off of and benefit from each other so I just don’t get the focus on Justin and Andrew, who are both far more successful on Tiktok than Greg, in any case.
I mean, Kaity and Zach are nowhere near my favorites and I disagree with you. People are fine with them because neither of them really did anything to despise them over, people overreacted to Zach's actions during the season and now they're just letting them live. Most people seem fairly ambivalent on them.  I agree with Dean and Caelynn and think they're a good example of this phenomenon. What Caelynn did was way, way worse than Zach's bumbling and she gets defended to the death here.
Omg I could not give less a fuck if Grant and Madi like it I just think it’s ugly why have I had to defend this this hard hahaha
Greg doesn’t even try on tik tok and he and Victoria can get millions of views. The only successful Justin videos is in a group. And even still none are big tik tok stars and NEVER will be. Kids in the middle of nowhere get more views and likes so none are making any real money
Yes, people very quickly forgot everything Caelynn did when she and Dean got together and now people adore her. I don't think we should harp on peoples' mistakes forever, but the 180 people have done on her is wild. Jade, too, after having kids.
I also think it's ugly, I'm just saying that there's not a lot the designers can do if the client doesn't give them anything to work with. I'm not coming for you, just discussing what I think happened.
Lets just agree to disagree on this 😂. I’ll agree with you on the fact that no one from the franchise is that good at making Tiktok content.
Oh no what did Jade do?
Go John B, hehe 😉 but, seriously, they better not edit this out!
Tanner at the kiss😂 initially clapped then was like ugh no lol
bro used his whole back to kiss her😂
Lols this just reminds me how uncomfortable it must not for multiple people to be dating one person.   If this stays in the actual show, I’m sure they’ll build drama around it. If everyone likes John B, it will be “oh he’s a clear front runner. Charity clearly like him” and if there are stronger connections, it will be “I can’t believe John B did that. Classless and so against the [arbitrary] code we set as men.”
this is such a stupid question, but where are the filming cameras??
That was a long ass kiss.
It looks like a lot of the men cheered for it and in some of the vids the ones next to him were patting him in the back and laughing with him. He’s prob going to be used for comedic relief.
The green lift above them and there was a guy to the right of Jordan and to the left of Charity
oh duh, the massive green thing haha 🤦‍♀️
I’m prepared for downvotes but looking at things from this perspective makes things feel so artificial!! I can’t imagine trying to play it up for the cameras and walking into these fake cheering crowds and perfectly manicured sets. everything’s so planned! you probably have a producer here yelling at the crowd to throw the balls higher or something. I totally see how this show attracts the wrong kind of people just looking for their 15 minutes of fame
Lol at that guy in the cowboy costume walking so completely stiff down the stairs.
I can’t imagine trying to date someone while trying to act on camera.
Michael having so much fun lol

if i'm doing the math correctly and this is Week 5, this should premiere the week of the Barbie premiere. pretty cool and smart marketing honestly!!
Wow she looks amazing in that pink!
As far as I can tell, there’s only like eight guys on this group date.   Are they on Week 5 already?
Love her shoes!! So impressed with her ability to strutt down those stairs 🤩🤩
It’s giving Keith Urban hair
Maybe 2 group dates this week?
Those shoes are amazing. I would have broken my neck on the ramp, forget the stairs haha
LMMFAO 😂
Probably two group dates, this was filmed March 28th

If I never see Joey Sasso’s face again, it’ll be too soon.
I only see Alyssa Edwards [tongue pop]
I literally only know Tayshia and Joey Sasso… my reality game is not as strong as I thought
This cast is so stacked that Tayshia might be the least exciting part lol
 Is that Teck from the Real World Hawaii??
I think the woman under Tayshia is from 90 Day Fiancé but that's all I got
KRISTIN DOUTE AND JILL ZARIN?!?! Okay fuck it. I’m in.
is. is that Pao from 90 day
She’s the only face I recognize lol
Do my eyes deceive me or is that Teck?
Rooting for Tayshia and Lauren! (with a tiny cheer for Jill because RHOA and RHONY were my first loves in the franchise lol)  Edit- horrendous typo LOL
![gif](giphy|bDIGn0Ps1IQ4tcd8Lf|downsized)  Paola??? Damn two of my favorite TV shows colliding...
I feel crazy if something because I don’t know a single person other than Tayshia in this pic and I consider myself pretty pop culture savvy.
Okay at first I thought that was Donald Glover and was like no way. Now I realize it's Wendell lol but they look a lot alike.
Im bad with faces but is that not kaitlyn on the bottom right?
Why can’t I place the bottom right lady even though I KNOW I’ve watched her on my TV screen?! 🤔
i see my girl there in the corner  ![gif](giphy|HKr1b592CEDQI)
Am I the only one who thought that was KB in the bottom right corner?
omg Jill Zarin from yesteryear‼️
ALYSSA EDWARDS  ![gif](giphy|l4FB4LxDofnMujMbe|downsized)
I wonder what the premise of the show is? I had assumed Tayshia was done with reality TV (in general). I guess I was wrong lol
Why do I still want to see CJ and Casey end up together
I don’t know any of these people besides Tayshia and Alyssa Edwards
I was curious about why Lauren's last Instagram video seemed to be in a hotel. Clearly she's terribly bored! 🤣  https://www.instagram.com/reel/CqlJkZauz2j/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=
This is random but does Sean Lowe have the most tv appearances of any lead? I had no clue he’s made so many tv appearances. Marriage Bootcamp, Worst Cooks in America, Wife Swap, DWTS. How come no one calls him thirsty?  https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5050331/
Let's go Teck!!
jill would be on this😂
Rooting for Tayshia and Wendell to ~kick it~
Omg I love LSpeed 😍
Reza from Shahs of Sunset haha this will be fun and spicy
![gif](giphy|l0DAGOyeLicWJX2Gk)
Joey Sasso was my pandemic hyperfixation
JOEY AND LAUREN AND TAYSHIA AND CJ?!?!?
That whole middle column looks like they'd go to court mandated AA meetings together, right before they hit the bars
Hmm not the direction I thought Tayshia would be heading. I wonder if ‘the boss’ title refers to building a brand or something.
I wonder if it’s anything like The Apprentice but with a promotion
So that’s the reason behind Paolas cryptic IG post a few days ago! Can’t wait!
Maybe this is me making a bigger deal of this then is necessary... but is this a Netflix show? Because if so then that means people from outside of Netflix shows (Bachelor/VPR) could be cast to go on Netflix shows (Perfect Match) and that makes me extra excited for future Netflix shows🤩 Think of the possibilities!
im rooting for lauren and tayshia! also i just wanna see tayshia and joey interact LMAO
Do we know what the show is about??
I’m shocked to see Wendell’s face. I’m pretty sure his baby is due anyway now.
Watching for Da'vonne!!!
DA’VONNE!!
Definitely watching to support my 3 black Queens. That vanderpump girl can go though. Yikes! Can’t believe she’s still getting opportunities
Watching for DaVonne, Teck, and Lauren!
I’m not one of those people that make things political or an anti Covid weirdo or any of that but…. Why are they in quarantine lol weird PR move to add that part
Love, love, love Joey!!!!
<<tongue popping intensifies>>
Back rolls???
Alyssa Edwards walking into the first day of filming like  ![gif](giphy|1zjONm5XpEm7a3bvdh|downsized)
if alyssa doesn’t win  https://i.redd.it/5x1dvrc19csa1.gif
Omg I can contribute: middle second row is Joey from The Circle and bottom right is CJ from Fboy Island (I think).
Haha fair. This is who I know starting from top left: Lauren Speed-Hamilton (Love Is Blind), ?, Tayshia Adams (Bach obviously), D'Avonne Rogers (BB), Joey Sasso (The Circle), someone from 90 day, ?, Teck Holmes (The Challenge) a Drag Race star, a Housewife, Wendell from Survivor, and CJ from FBOY Island
I think top left is Lauren Speed from Love is Blind and 3rd row left is Kristen from Vanderpump Rules
Bottom middle: Wendell (Survivor)   Middle middle:  Teck (Real World, The Challenge)
![gif](giphy|KHlqf1xEPzFrr8xYrw)  Mariposa!
Saaaaammmmeeeee cannot stand him, horrible vibes
Yeah same. He was fine on the first season of The Circle, but he's just...too much now.
I only recognize her and Joey from Netflix’s the circle. I don’t watch a lot of big reality shows.
I was just thinking that.
You’re old and you don’t know Teck?!
![gif](giphy|l1Ku8dzzblP5Yv0n6)
right? He must be a lot more charasmatic in real life. Kinda feels like a one trick pony to me
The funniest reality tv personality ever. Any show is instantly made better by her showing up!  ![gif](giphy|oNUSheqzEI9WRD9muy|downsized)
![gif](giphy|CVE14s1WjfjwY)
Any chance to get more Alyssa I will BE THERE
Alyssa is probably my all time favorite reality TV person ever.
Yes right there with ya
These two plus Davonne are unironically reality hall of fame for me.
mt rushmore of reality tv
Mariposa
What does alternates mean ?
came here to say this
Yeeeeeeeep
yessir!
Forget old Bachelor seasons…where can I stream Real World Hawaii?
I think it’s Paola, she was with Russ, I think they maybe got divorced? They had a pretty tumultuous relationship, but I guess everyone on 90 day does. This is a wild mashup of people though. It’ll be fun to see how they all interact with each other.
I…think so?
I had the same thought. Is she blonde now? Is she still doing her wrestling thing? Is she still with Russ? I have so many questions.
You are not being deceived! I said the same thing!
Guess her wrestling career was going nowhere 💀
I think it's CJ from F Boy Island
And bottom left Jill zarin??
cj fboy island
I did
It’s not??
Jill Zarin from RHONY baby!!💃🏼💃🏼💃🏼  ![gif](giphy|vVUKjsSoJraKY)
She’s the only person I recognized
These stars always say that but once the cheques stop rolling in they tend to come right back😂
Nooooooooo
His sister is worse.
Jill will go on anything. Love her for that
I loved Wendell on Survivor! He was done dirty during WaW
He’s expecting a baby soon so kinda shocked he’s doing this
He was just on The Traitors on peacock (but got kicked off early…first maybe?) he’s really jonesing for a comeback.
Gotta build that empire!
nope, not yet! but given these cast members are all people with stronger personalities, it tells me whatever it is, it's gonna be goooooood
What happened with her? I just started watching and I’m on season 2
believe it was common practice even before covid to keep the cast in at least brief isolation before filming began as they gathered b roll, collected info, did psychological and physical health screenings, etc (plus not wanting them to interact with the rest of the cast yet too much off camera bc they want to film that stuff) I think quarantine has just become a more commonly used phrase now plus just seems smart to start filming with a fully healthy cast and crew
Hollywood productions are supposed to follow their covid protocols until May. One of those, for shows like this, involved quarantine before starting to film.
because a covid outbreak on set would cause delays and cost them money.
Here in the states, Covid is most definitely still running rampant. If they are filming here I call this a smart move!
I was wondering the same!
it’s standard practice for a lot of reality shows even before covid
I know majority of these people but my brain for some reason did not recognize them 😭
omg i didn’t even realize that was da’vonne def gonna watch this now
I did NOT recognize Paola from 90DF wow
Oh my goodness! They picked the worst pictures of these people! I know Lauren from LiB and then I've watched multiple shows with both Joey and D'Avonne and I didn't recognize any of them!!
You forgot Kristen doute 😭
![gif](giphy|CVE14s1WjfjwY)  Absolutely! One of my favorite drag queens!
 Butterfly
If anybody gets kicked off or leaves the show for emergency reasons early on in filming, they will be replaced with either of these 2.
I think it’s one of the seasons on paramount plus.
Yes, that's who it is!
Hiiiiiiiii
There we go!! Thank you!!!
😂
Haha that’s true. Money talks…🙊
I really can't defend it 😂
Damn that just triggered a deep memory from my GOMI days
fr😂😂😂
Oh wow I had no idea. Reality TV people just can’t get enough of reality TV.
She got fired from the show for being a rac**t. I haven’t watched in a while though but enjoy it was good for some time
Plus If one gets covid that person has to stop filming for some days and maybe more actors, that's expensive. They're trying to keep the costs low for production, that's why most staff on set still wears masks
No I didn't forget her. I put a question mark in place of where her name should be because I didn't know who she was. I was listing who *I* knew from the list above, so no I didn't "forget" anyone.
I just can’t wait to see people react to the hilarious random shit she says 😂  My favorite clip of hers is her explaining why Tom Hanks is her celebrity crush and what kissing him would be like.
My bad, you’re right, similar look to me initially though! Sorry :)
Ahh okay I remember hearing Stassi got fired for something similar but yikes. Seems on brand though she gives off Karen energy this season
why the snark, just edit your comment.....
Wasnt that serious tbh lol
tbh i didn't even realize it was CJ til the other person commented that so no worries friend😂
Yes she got fired the same time this one did and they both gave that off to me so I wasn’t surprised by the tea that came out years later about them being 🗑️ 😂
Please tell me where I was snarky?? I was explaining to the other Redditor why I did not forget that person in my comment. I don't need to edit my comment, because once again I was listing the people *I* know from this list. I do not know who this Kristen person is. If other people know, great!
100% Stassi is in sufferableeeee
I mean, they got fired because someone gave them information that wasn't as accurate as it should have been. They both have definitely grown from the people we see on screen from Season 1-Season 7, and they continue to put in the work when you watch their podcasts and read their books.  Kristen is a fun personality to watch though, and as you'll see later in VPR - Stassi, Jax and Kristen are 80% of the reason the show was ever good. Without those 3, it gets bland QUICK
That woman got a following, a man, and an entire squad from this show, damn she really ran the table.
I hope it lasts, but I just can't wrap my mind around how Gabi will be okay potentially being around Zach with their history on the show lol.
Kaity seems like such a gem. I think it's so telling that *every single* girl who did a podcast/interview during the season named her as one of their closest friends.
Kaity just sounds like such an amazing person. And Gabi did sound like she thinks the world of her
Their friendship will probably fade over time like most of the show friendships do but it’s nice that they’re so mature about it. Kaity just seems like a total sweetheart and she obviously became close with Gabi throughout the process. I don’t think Zach joining the hangouts for a bit but I don’t see why they can’t be friends.
Kaity is such a girls girl. love that things are okay between her and Gabi!! 🖤
I think Kaity’s friendship with Gabi will likely remain strong for now … while her and Zach are in the engagement, aka ‘dating with a ring’, phase of the relationship  but if it lasts awhile, to the point where they are actually legit considering marriage, things might get awkward for Kaity and Gabi.
Kaity and Gabi forever!
Some of you guys are weirdos, Gabi and Katy had way more time to bond and build a friendship than Gabi and Zach had to build a significant relationship. I’m sure it’ll take some healing time, but at the end of the day, they’re barely exes, barely have a history. Their relationship on the show is more in line with a one night stand/short situationship than with a relationship. It’s going to be wayyyy more important how things move forward from here in the real world. Do you guys really not have anyone within your friend group who previously hooked up and it literally doesn’t matter??
Uh oh…Miami…will they come back friends??
Im getting the Caelynn  and Cassie vibe from these two
I think this friendship is uber unhealthy for Gabi.
Female friendship from the show will last longer than any BN relationship so it’s nice to see they are maintaining that
Article link: https://bachelornation.com/2023/04/05/kaity-biggar-reveals-she-and-gabi-elnicki-will-remain-close-friends-regardless-of-the-bachelor-ending/
They can all gain more followers post-show from showing their girls only trips to comped resorts on TikTok and Instagram than Kaity will ever gain with Zach, who is boring on social media.
We’ll see what happens once Zach starts “frowning” about it
I have a friend who also has issues with boundaries and ex’s etc. and let’s just say she hasn’t had a LTR… ever. Doesn’t seem to be a formula that works. I just don’t see how this strong connection is healthy after everything that went down. The whole “I told his family you can’t get rid of me” is giving uncomfortable vibes.
“Close” friends sounds unlikely and unrealistic. Being close means being somewhat close to Zach as well and I just can’t see how that’d be smart or healthy for Gaby’s healing.   I think it’s okay to love people from a distance.
Am I the only one who thinks that there will be a blowup between them?
Can someone remind me of what this mud puddle comment was
Yea and after watching ATFR she's definitely not over it/him either.
That’s my thought too but I got downvoted for saying that during the finale lol   I just didn’t see how Gabi would want to spend time with Zach or hear about him longtime, the way a real friendship would require
I think it’s about time and space. They’re not the first close friends to seriously date the same guy and it really isn’t as big of a deal as people want to make it. The fact it was public on national tv is a curveball, but I actually feel hopeful this means they’ll be looking to looking to focus on something else in their influencer careers and not milk the bachelor F2 narrative to death.
They can also be friends without being couple friends-- zach won't come on girls' trips
We used to work together and she is an absolute wonderful person. So kind, genuine, hardworking, and smart! I miss having her as a coworker but love seeing her thriving
Girl should go on Survivor next with these social skills!
She seems very wanting to please, so I can see them thinking she's super nice. She found out Gabi slept with Zach, and when they chatted at the rose ceremony quietly for a moment, she was basically reassuring Gabi that she was in the lead with "I know you're the only one he slept with, no, no scarlet A!" like Gabi feeling good was the most important thing.   I hope she is not a people pleaser, but her staying with her ex for years despite toxicity, focusing on making Gabi happy and reassured, and accepting that Zach even did it, then told her about it on camera before their date, etc makes me worried that Kaity is the type to always put other people first, always forgiving, and at some point, put yourself first! Kaity is worthy of having boundaries.  I hope I'm wrong. I guess we will see. But I can definitely see why everyone speaks so highly of her.
Agree. It’s nice they have good things to say about one another, but we’ve seen it before and they’ll most likely drift apart. I just can’t imagine Gabi being so close to Kaitlyn where she becomes her bridesmaid or smth..
I think it depends! For example Rachel/Astrid/Kristina/Whitney and Alexis are all still close friends and nick’s seasons was 6 years ago
I think it may actually be the opposite. It’s probably hardest for Gabi now because Kaity “won,” she came in second like she feared, and the wounds are still fresh. Once Gabi is loved up down the road and sees that it was never Zach, it will probably be easier on their friendship.
I would agree with this but Catherine & Leslie (from Sean's season) stayed super super tight afterwards too. I can't remember how far Leslie made it, but a long time if I remember right (home towns). Leslie and Sean had "the worlds longest make out" record or something like that and I remember thinking how odd their friendship was. haha.
How did that end
Same. I mean I get the sentiment of clicking well and wanting to stay friends, but who wants to always have the reminder of the ex they were hoping would propose and then he chose your friend over you?
Completely agree. There doesn’t need to be bad will or animosity, but the history is there. So she’s going to go on a couples trip with Kaity and Zach some day?
Agree. Zach and the trauma will be orbiting her all the time. I wish she didn’t need to punish herself like that. She could have a friendship with Kaity but better from a distance, and not until after she’s had more time to heal.
This. They just met, they knew each other a couple of months, didn't they have besties from before their season? I love that they support each other and have each other's backs, but that doesn't mean they have to hang out that much. I wouldn't want my son's ex coming around tied at the hip with his new fiance (and Gabi saying that implies she doesn't care if it bugs Zach or his family), so I wonder why Kaity would do that? Can't she hang out with Gabi when the family isn't around only? If she wasn't such a nice person, I'd think she was trying to stick it to Zach in some way.
*to you
Nah they don't seem like those kind of girls. I think more likely is they will drift apart if Zach and Kaity stay together. I imagine that would make things awkward at minimum for Gabi even though she has developed such a solid friendship with Kaity.
i feel like it would have already happened
When gabi got out of the car for the frc they parked by a puddle. She got out and said “don’t do this to Kaity. When it really matters and Kaity gets here, don’t do this to her”
Even if she's not bitter, it's just awkward awkward awkward. You had sex with this man, almost got engaged to this man. I know it's the nature of the show, but that'd be too much of a mind fuck for me. And it's not even in person, she's going to have to see pictures of him with Kaity all the time.
This is different than someone who went home week 3, 4 or 5 though. Gabi legit made it to the final rose ceremony. That's going to be a bit different than most past people who dated the Bachelor and are on good terms. But then again Rachel R was around Clayton not too long ago and they seemed fine so maybe it will be the same with Gabi and Zach.
Love to hear this!
i was just thinking this! girl be making alliances with everyone lol.
I’m confused, I don’t see anything here about Gabi and Kaity hanging out with Zach’s family
I think Gabi and Zach having sex could change things…but tbh it depends on how the people involved view sex. Sometimes it’s fine. Sometimes it’s messy.
Leslie was arounf F6/5, so no hometown date
Colton turned out to be a major creep and then Cassie and Caelynn seemed to grow apart when Caelynn met Dean.
No literally
A couples trip… why I am seeing visions of Tom Sandoval and Raquel…?
Zach would have to care for her to stick it to him but the whole thing is major cringe.
Was that not implied?
Oh yeah duh!! How could I forget
I don’t know about bachelor stuff, but from irl experience people inter-date in friend groups a lot. It’s not that unusual as long as people are well-intentioned and set their boundaries appropriately.
Gabi told Zach's family to expect to see her because she's so close to Kaity.
I don’t think it will.  Kaity seemed to have the right attitude during that week and knew it could happen.  The ones who have had issues about it (e.g. Shawn) made it clear right away.  Kaity never had issues with the sex, just on how/when he told her.  Big difference
Really? Gosh I coulda sworn I remembered seeing her familys home and thinking "wowza - this girl has probably never wanted a thing in her life" haha. But that was 2 kids, 100000 hours of lost sleep and 65489083829 brain cells ago so I could absolutely be wrong.
Omg are they not friends anymore?
Seriously! That was crazy! Raquel needs such validation, but to do a good friend dirty like that. I have never understood putting a romantic interest before a friend.
They've both said they're still friends but immediately after Colton's season they were inseparable BFFs. I think they've just naturally drifted since they've both settled into their longterm relationships and don't live near each other anymore.
They’ve confirmed multiple times they’re still friends, they just don’t hang out as often now that they don’t live in the same place anymore
TL;DR - She broke her arm
Can those those kids have ONE private moment ? Fucking hell. Those poor kids. I hope she’s putting some of the money she exploits them away for therapy, they’ll need it. Lots and lots of it.
Molly got out of surgery and got home today, but Ali has already made two posts on her grid about this..very curious on if there’s any moment in her life that she lives independently without thinking about how she’ll portray it on IG.  https://preview.redd.it/7mxnfnl797sa1.jpeg?width=1169&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=079a65e24976fcdf903377dd7994bc0b1a5a72c0
Ali always says she will do anything for her kids, although I guess giving them any sort of privacy isn’t included in that anything.
I wish she could give her children privacy.
She’s been exploiting her children since they were born. She makes me sick
 I hope her daughter heals quickly and isn’t in pain. But this is too much Ali. Privacy. Being off your phone and not staging photos while your daughter is in a hospital bed.
soo.. i started following her because I saw that she was supporting the need for stricter gun laws but then I saw these posts and I was like ummm this is not ok!   I for one would not want any of my hospital pics be shown to nearly 1 M people … this is just ridiculous. these are young kids!!  ugh  had to unfollow
Just imagine…if she deleted her IG. The freedom she would feel, to not post and share every second, every thought.
I don’t know why I’m surprised Ali would share this when she frequently shares videos of Molly’s night terrors and has for years.
Man, I am just... so enormously grateful that my childhood took place before it was trendy for parents to share everything about their kids' lives on Instagram.
The whole aesthetic of the IG grid: the overexposed photos and perfectly coordinated outfits catapulted me back to 2016 and forced me to turn my phone brightness down..   I’m just glad to have some Gen Z friends y’all 😂
Ugh, she's right up there with Hilaria Baldwin.
No judgment, just trying to figure it out- is her hair silver? Or is it just blonde?
Omg. Wow. This is crazy, but not as bad as the "teen mom" dad that is charging people to meet and greet with his son. Just yikes!
https://preview.redd.it/bxot534dcesa1.jpeg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=286e824e99cf7cb35dcc3ac5d7964a7d5a292034  This would be mortifying, Idc.  She can’t even keep her kids’ secrets.  I was proud of Ali for standing up for safe gun laws last week but this reminds me why I don’t Follow her (or any BNer). I just would never or could never put my children — or anyone! — on blast as much as she does.
Hoping she heals soon. To this day my most painful experience was breaking my arm. I’ve never experienced a pain like that again. It was awful.
Is her insta down now?? Did y’all bully her to delete??!!
Ali really needs to get offline and give her kids privacy. At the end of the day, these kids do not consent to being shared with a million strangers.
Thank you, when someone posted this article on the sub, I immediately thought of Ali: [https://www.teenvogue.com/story/influencer-parents-children-social-media-impact](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/influencer-parents-children-social-media-impact)
Pretty dramatic to begin with and not sure how her daughter breaking her arm was a “sign” in favour of either side. What a weird and long take on a personal decision
Good lord Ali needs to log off 😑 can she not have these personal convos with her partner, friends, family, therapist? She’s gonna have a bunch of wackos in the comments who believe in signs from the universe  Also Re: kids her own age, won’t Molly now be the oldest in the class for her new grade? It’s just furthering the issue for others. Starting 1st grade at 6 is completely normal.
It seems odd to describe her child breaking her arm as a “sign”
Well, you wouldn't have gotten a ton of DMs asking about it if you didn't post about it to begin with, Ali.
This is so weird and gross and exploitative. Put your phone down and actually focus on your kids, Ali. Ugh
It’s absolutely absurd how this woman has absolutely zero boundaries with her kids. She shares videos of her daughter having night terrors regularly!
The list of these parents is long.. especially within bachelor nation.
Haha same, it was a quick follow then unfollow for me as well lol
Sometimes she posts videos of Molly having night terrors. Also awhile back she had to let everyone know her son was constipated. Asked for recommendations on what to give him to make him poop.
I commented on that thread that everyone following her for her gun posts would be disappointed when they realized how much she exploits her kids
Sadly, I don't think she could do it. She'll be "missing" for a few hours or a day and be back like "omg guys I'm so sorry I haven't posted much"
I am shocked anytime she posts one of those. Like wtf. Give the girl some privacy. Then again, I just saw she posted that Molly's cast was signed by her school crush saying "love, name" with a photo of the signing   (covered the boy's face) but omg, do you really have to share every single thing about your daughter online?
Very cool blonde. She shared before that she always asks the hairdresser to give her the coolest possible blonde.  I am embarrassed I remember this, but I too was on a quest (now abandoned) to get to a really cool blonde tone lol
WHAT
For the sake of her kids she needs to be bullied offline.

From what I understand, Ali is going to have Molly repeat first grade so that she will be 6 going on 7 instead of 7 going on 8 like the other kids. I'm glad that Molly gets a say in it, and if she doesn't mind repeating a grade, then I don't see an issue with it. I was born in December so I was one of the youngest people in my grade and it wasn't a huge deal, but it was definitely annoying later on in high school seeing people turn 16 and get their driver's license early in the year while I had to wait until the end of the year.
She will but that’s kind of the point. My daughter has an august birthday and I’ll be holding her back a year so she’s one of the oldest instead of the youngest. Teachers, doctors, psychologists all agree it’s better to be older than younger.
Well I didn’t see those comments but hopefully others did
I remember once she was gone for an hour and came back and apologized for taking a nap….
Thanks for the intel! And definitely not judging that. I still remember cute outfits that Jillian wore on her season that I tried to copy 😂
Yes Amber is the Teen Mom. She has lost custody of both children. The father to her son offers meet ups with his little guy for money. Just overall sad.
Lol, it’s back up. We didn’t do enough.
Molly has a July bday so she’ll (I assume) be one of the oldest in the class next year. It seems what started mostly holding boys who were socially not ready back has evolved into holding every kid back? Which sucks she feels she has to hold her (age appropriate) kid back just because everyone else did.
Ahahah thank you for making me feel better 😂
What's sad is that dude is a total Qanon freak who believes that Hillary Clinton was running a sex ring out of a pizza joint in the DC suburbs but he's literally pimping his son out? To meet what are assuredly pedophiles?
Ali claims it is a thing in Nashville  but I am starting to think it could just be a big thing at her school. I know some kids do get held back but not everyone.
Lol that pizza place is in my best friend’s neighborhood and it’s delicious
Yeah….. July baby and Nashville native. Definitely one of the youngest in my grade but have never in my life heard of it being a “thing” in Nashville.
I think it's definitely school dependent. My elementary school held back most kids, some 2, even 3 years. There were 10 year olds in my first grade class. They were nice kids, but GIANT. I'm guessing they did that to inflate their test scores but I don't really know.
The QAnon freaks doxxed and harassed my friend that worked there because he's gay and that CLEARLY meant that he was abusing the non-existent children that were chained up in the non-existent basement 😭
Right there’s literally no basement! How horrible for your friend.
He is a 🔥 smokeshow 🔥 y’all.  https://preview.redd.it/4mo8tpw1z6sa1.png?width=1124&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8eb6125d1e2138eac1ba91eb8f675b578b282c28  (She tagged him & he’s a model when he’s not a carpenter/WOODworker so I feel okay posting this.)  Well, I just found new book boyfriend aesthetic inspo. Lol.  (Hi to his gf. You did good girlllll.)
Omg I follow the table guy and his girlfriend on TikTok. Haha my worlds are colliding, I’ve been following them for months . So hot
OP, not sure if you just preferred images but you can screen record and upload the whole video
Loling because his girlfriend is from Winter House if y’all are Bravo fans
I read this in her voice lol
He kind of looks like hannah b boyfriend
His girlfriend is breathtakingly gorgeous as well.
If anyone watches r/WinterHouse this is Jess’s (from last season) boyfriend that Gabby’s talking about
That’s hilarious that the gf DMed 😂 I feel like Gabby always ends up in unintentionally funny situations
Table guy is linked to her Insta story, and he is hot.
That’s a lot of “likes.” 😝
I guess her and Alan’s date didn’t go well if she was so into this guy?
Anyone think she’s saying this stuff to distract and keep her relationship with Alan private?
He kinda looks like Jed
Omg def can’t blame her for looking this guy up, wow 🥵
What’s his tiktok?
Gabby linked to the hot guy in her story and I did not want to capture that link in it.
Crypto Lindsay
She's a doll.
Who?
It is really funny doing this in her voice!  She is hilarious.
Oh God. Not Lindsey's knock off.
NOOOOO
No.  She said that she's on dating apps and looking for hot guys in LA based on her stories the past couple of days. Not sure the Alan thing went very far
Their "date" was all for PR. Totally fake. If she's talking about this "hot table guy" she's definitely moved on.
Ah ok
The way I just went to Kyle's instagram to look up crypto Lindsey and couldn't find her because I forgot her name and just looked for Lindsey. 😂. Had to go find a winter house picture to get her actual name.
Wasn’t really a fan of her on the show, but she is gorgeous
That’s what I mean I think she’s staying stuff like that to distract from her and Alan. She went to dinner the other night and didn’t say who or post pics
Probably right. I don't think she has much of a relationship with Alan if she's active on dating apps.
I think she may be fibbin tho to throw people off
I don't think so. I don't think Alan's her type. He doesn't look much like Table guy or like Erich.
The only reason I watch the show is to listen to the podcasts. 😂
Rosecast is one of the main reasons I still tune in! Rim and AB truly crack me up every time.
Love to See It and Rosecast!
I’m concerned for some of y’all who are above the 4-6 range 😅
I just come here and read the transcripts people write up. So appreciative of those who do that!
0, but I read a lot of them on here 🤣  (Recappers, you're the real MVPs)
Just Rosecast. I used to listen to Dear Shandy and Love to See It but quit both of those for various reasons
i just listen to Rosecast. i adore Rim and AB😭😭
This poll made me feel ashamed 🤣 I listen to 4 regularly. Apparently less common than I assumed…
Just Rosecast. I used to listen to the Betchelor but I think after Fat Carrie Bradshaw left, the show wasn't the same. Plus I had no interest in listening to "Kay's Weekend"
People that responded 4-6 or greater:  You guys doing ok?
I used to listen to Reality Steve, Chatty Broads, and occasionally Olivia's, Kaitlyn's, and BHH. Then the show became more boring and I became less interested in hearing other opinions when just watching the show already felt like too much time spent.
I chose 7-9 because I only listen to 4ish religiously but then will check out other ones depending on the guests or if I heard they talked about good stuff. I’m very surprised to see that most of this sub doesn’t listen to bachelor podcasts at all!
none but i read the summaries yall post
Reddit is enough for me 🙂
Once I started listening to GOR I can’t listen to anything else. Subscribing to their Patreon also helps bc they do the “Digging Deeper” episode every other week where they play all the important clips from the other pods
Bachelor Party regularly. Occasionally Love to see it, Off the Vine and I’ll listen to Viall Files if there’s a specific interview I’m interested in.
Game of Roses, Your Mom and Dad
Results are making me feel like a big loser lmao
The people who voted 10-12 I have a question…are you ok?
Dear Shandy and Your Mom and Dad
Bachelor Party, Love to See It, Rosecast, The Betchelor, sometimes GOR and Dear Shandy, aka I spent probably three times the length of the show on podcasts 🫠 in my defense, I walk a lot 😅
GOR only.
GOR, Dear Shandy, Love to see it.
I listen to a lot of other podcasts but I haven’t found a Bachelor one that hooks me. I just read the recaps on here, haha.
0 right now. Was listening to 1-3 for a bit but decided that watching the show + perusing this sub is more than enough Bachelor
Rosecast only 🙏
Your mom and dad and dear shandy!  I recently got into Dear Shandy. Chatty Broads was the only podcast I religiously listened to. Still miss their show!
Love to See it and Dear Shandy, occasionally GOR
I listen to GOR and Dear Shandy
1. Game of Roses (though I ff through a lot of the sports announcer parts bc they’re really loud when you have headphones) 2. Dear Shandy (though I ff through a lot of their singing lmao) 3. Love to See It if it’s a really juicy episode that I just need more POVs for
[removed]
I listen to every episode of Game of Roses, Viall Files, and Dear Shandy. Then occasionally will tune into She’s All Bach, Your Mom & Dad, and Off The Vine. I listen to Higher Learning but don’t consider that a bachelor nation podcast even though Rachel Lindsay is the host.
i listen to nick viall kick me out if you need to 🙈
It really depends on the week/guest etc. I think I subscribe to maybe 5 (?) but probably only listen to two/week. I may put on one as background noise while doing something else but I wouldn’t consider that listening
Every episode of GOR and She’s All Bach. Others as specific drama unfolds or for a certain interviews
If you aren't listening to Game of Roses, you definitely need to start. The way they talk about the show is so interesting and their takes are always soooo mindblowingly good. I love the game perspective. I used to listen to She's All Bach a lot but ever since finding GOR, SAB bores the shit out of me (sorry jackie and stephanie)
Your Mom and Dad & Game of Roses consistently. I watch more of Dave Neal’s YouTube videos more than I listen to the podcast because I usually have to skip through parts I already heard/watched about and don’t like to do that too much while driving.
![gif](giphy|rL4H14c1U4EORPdsj3|downsized)
I listen to 13 (but decided to click 10-12 lol)
Only Dave Neal. I find him hilarious.
This is interesting to me has everyone totally given up on Bachelor Party? I still listen but sometimes the decisions drive me a lil nuts, like how after the finale Juliet did a love is blind recap instead of a finale recap? Because she didn’t feel like watching the finale? So odd
Does CITO count?
Does anyone else listen to Will You Accept This Rose? That and GOR are about all I can handle.
Just two: Rosecast and Bachelor Party
I subscribe to a lot of them, but consistently listen to Rosecast, Love to See It, and 2 Black Girls 1 Rose when they were recapping Bachelor. I sometimes listen to others, but these are the ones I tune into even if I haven’t watched the episode.
The podcasts are still fun without watching the show 😅
It’s such a great feel good pod!
These two I still listen to, mostly rosecast since I haven’t been watching
I didn’t select that, but I have a long commute and listen to different ones depending on my mood (not the same ones every week).
Haha this is my exact lineup, in that order. Never miss a Rosecast, still mostly enjoying Dear Shandy but I’ll skip now and then, rarely listen to Love to See It but I might if they have an interesting guest.
Same. Rosecast and Dear Shandy but lately Dear Shandy is becoming a distant 2nd.
Yesss rosecast and dear Shandy are my two favorites. Love all of rosecast all the time. They’re so good.
Also in the 4-6 category. There are dozens of us!
I agree so much! The show was so fun when FCB was on, now it’s just kind of insufferable. I don’t think I could possibly relate to two people LESS than I relate to Kay and Jared lol
i don't think so ![img](emote|t5_2tj74|582)
These are my top ones as well. I'm most consistent with Dear Shandy because sometimes the Your Mom and Dad episodes get really long and I skip them or only listen to part of an episode.  I will listen to Clickbait (another short podcast, which I like) if the guest is interesting. Viall Files as well if the guest is interesting.
Would you be willing to share some good podcasts you’ve found?
Hahah my thoughts exactly! It’s the only one I listen to 🤷🏻‍♀️
Haha for sure. If I’m low on time I just listen to the podcasts 😂. Priorities
Rosecast, Dear Shandy, Love to See it, and Your Mom and Dad. I probably could drop one and not miss it too much but really enjoy all of them!
![gif](giphy|3taYXLxSBOugHHjocB|downsized)
Can you both scooch your chairs a little further away from me?
What happened between Rachel and Zach in the fantasy suites
Can you please untie me (because if I’m at dinner I was clearly kidnapped) ;)
I have a lot of questions. First of all how dare you?
![gif](giphy|10XiFYfOhhFxjW)
![gif](giphy|qNzamLsqvp3zi|downsized)
You're paying right?
To Chris Harrison: Which of the contestants have you hooked up with?
Do you think Reality Steve is a good or bad thing for the franchise?
![gif](giphy|SbN0WomN4S7Z7tpKOC|downsized)
Can you even name 5 contestants who didn’t endure emotional abuse on your watch?
I wouldn't ask anything but would def order the most expensive meal/drinks on the menu!
I’d ask them both based on their experience of either abusing women, or dishonoring your marriage and wife, what makes them qualified to be on a show about love?   I’d also ask Chris at what moment precisely he thought to himself “I am the beacon of BN.” The whole “omg it’s Chris Harrison” hype they played on in the show was hilarious to me. Bro you’re literally no one.
why am i here? can i leave?
Do you have any black friends?
![gif](giphy|SbN0WomN4S7Z7tpKOC|downsized)
Can I be freed? I don’t deserve to be held against my will
Are you guys covering the check?
To leave.
12.5% (lower now) of the comments played along with your hypothetical.
“How did I get here?”
When did you realize you are racists
Can you go away forever?
on a scale of 1 to 10 how racist are you

To GTFO
WHYYYYYY?!?!?!?
What’s your definition of abuse?
🤣💀
I want to know too
💀💀💀
Was coming to say this lol
Applies to Fleiss too. The dark seasons were a cesspool of women being taken advantage of by TPTB allegedly
OMG I was just about to post this!! You beat me too it 😂
☠️☠️☠️
I have a bachelor/Ette sleuthing account separate from my personal, so def more than 20 😅
No social media for me!  Is this hellhole considered social media?
Only Rachel Lindsay!
About a hunnit
I honestly don’t know lol I’m kinda weird because in some cases I only follow one half of a couple particularly on Instagram. For example I follow Dean but not Caelynn. I follow a few who are now inactive or least they don’t post anything about themselves anymore (new relationship, vacay pics etc).
Kaitlyn, Arie & Lauren, Clare, Jojo.  I think I also followed Astrid, Tia and Raven lately to see if they had any interesting pregnancy/baby content as I am now also pregnant but I usually follow/unfollow pretty quickly as I see the stories are not interesting for me.
I don't follow any, but I also don't follow anybody I don't know personally. I try to keep my follower count at 69 at all times. Sometimes it means I have to cut people but those are the sacrifices one makes for comedy.
You guys life is so much better without Facebook/instagram/TikTok. I’m so happy since leaving social medias (besides this).
Very few. I think only Dean & Caelynn, Rachel L
Ariel, Serena, Natasha, Becca, Thomas, Kaity, Gabi, Rachel, Gabby, Joe, Noah, Kenny, Abi, Mari, Dylan, Caelynn, Hannah G, Cassie, Michelle, Zach, Hannah Ann, Bri, Tayshia
Mykenna Dorn, Katie Thurston and Rachel Lindsay.
Pretty sure Teddi is the only one I follow lol
Rachel L, Rachel R, Becca, Thomas, charity, Kaity, gabby, gabi, Kristina, Whitney, Ashley S, Kelley, Natasha, Serena, Astrid, Susie, Claire, Tayshia   Way more than I thought or should 😂
I only follow Katie Thurston and only for the Tommy content. That cat is the true Bachelor Nation angel on earth (sorry Hannah Ann).
Becca Tilley, Dean & Big Rach for me. I find them to be consistently genuine and authentically themselves.
Caelynn, Dean, Rachel Lindsay, Jason Tartick, Kaitlyn B, and Sharleen.
Matt and Rachel L
Dean/Caelynn, Rudi, and Matty J/Laura.   I also follow Cassie’s sister Michelle, so does that count as Bachelor-adjacent?😂
Hannah Ann, Bekah, Hannah G, Rachel Lindsay, Kelley, Greg, Natasha, and Gabi so more than I thought
Only 6 that I saw when I went through but I used to follow wayyyy more. I follow Rachel L., Rachel R., Bri, Michelle, Ariel, and Charity
pretty much just kit lol, love her cooking videos
I only follow Olivia Caridi because of her travel content and we have IRL mutual friends.
I answered 1-5 but I just checked my finsta following list and ummm… I need to change my answer 🙈
Same. This way it doesn't clog my personal page.
Yep
Way more than I thought I did tbh
Let’s hope this lasts. Don’t want to see him on my screen this summer
https://preview.redd.it/6zj57w1kn6sa1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1204d628a1184a454a48cb09707db5d76139a0d8  Apparently she’s no stranger to BN 👀
dying at “no l❤️nger available”
YES THIS MEANS NO PARADISE  https://i.redd.it/vrhkeaxiz6sa1.gif
![gif](giphy|dciTprgZjX8ciotJpu)
Yay! Glad she volunteered. Keep him off paradise!
He had 3 on Bachelor in Paradise
Aaron won't be on paradise  ![gif](giphy|uydLaSqS7YguFiOOpX)
soo nectar
Wonderful news! This means he won’t be on the beach this summer (fingers crossed)
Thank the lord I didn’t wanna deal with seeing him again this summer
Is this the girl he's known for 4 years that he was dating at the same time as his other pre-Paradise girlfriend and went right back to after filming? Or a new girl?
Good for them. I’m really happy for them.  ![gif](giphy|oesbpxx2cl7lS)
Just one this time?
This guy 😂 it's hard to be happy for him when he acted like the epitome of a toxic fratboy/finance bro on the Bachelorette and BIP.
I read that as MALICEGRAY
Same girl he was dating pre-paradise or is she different?
Good. He needs to stay out of paradise
Hopefully he stays off the beach
Tell me he didn’t buy that hat for this picture 😭
I’m wondering if this poor girl is aware that she’ll be raising a man child. 🚩🚩🚩
good luck to her yikes
🎶 NEVER PARADISE, NOT KNOCKING ON HEAVEN’S DOOR 🎶
Damn that should be me. I dunno why I’m so attracted do his mega fuck boi energy maybe bc he’s ironic about it
Only the one or?/s
The hat is cringe lol
If this means he won’t be on BIP, congrats to them. Thanks for biting the bullet girl.   Oh no wait … this is Aaron we’re talking about. Never mind.
Girl blink twice if you're in danger.
Great. Hopefully he’ll go away
Omg the HAT really takes this over the edge
she looks pretty cool on instagram, v curious about what she sees in him  (don’t get me wrong, i thirst follow aaron, but he’s… you know)
Thank god
Wonder if this is “Amy” from the “Amy” and “Beth” saga
why does she lowkey look like kaitlyn bristowe
Oh thank gosh that's at least one oxygen hogger we won't see on paradise
“Understanding” lol
He’s clearly trying to make James jealous
His hat 🤣
She looks like Lana from love island uk
Thank goodness!
Poor girl
Who’s gonna be the new Bitch on the Beach?™️  *Aaron I like how you kept your season entertaining, this is a silly joke, not hate
Thought he hard (soft?) launched a relationship in the last few months...?  Same girl?
Aaron C? Why are we using an initial here? Is there another Aaron from this franchise?
I just saw this and I came here to say I’ve been listening to her music since 2018 and I think she’s way too cool for him fr. Anyways stream Pink Cadillac by Alice Gray  ETA: fun fact, Alice dated the guy who played the creepy soccer coach on Sex Lives of College Girls for years before she got together with Aaron
Is this the one he was with before paradise???
Who bought his hat? 😂
Poor girl. I want to thank her big time though because maybe if we’re lucky this will keep that misogynistic asshole out of BIP this summer and I won’t have to see him again.🤞🤞🤞
What in the 2010 trucker hat is going on here?  Also totally stopped scrolling in my tracks to pause as I thought that was Claire H from BB23.
I often find that the ones the audience think are so awful and insincere tend to be the most normal. Same friends, same city, still works, found a normal girl and isn’t hiding her and doesn’t go to every f list event he can  He got some stuff to work on like tino but not the devil
MY KING HAS FOUND HIS QUEEN
She’s so cute!!
I like him in the first paradise but man he got so annoying and toxic
Why is she verified? Not snark I’m genuinely curious.
you think a girlfriend would stop aaron clancy from going on paradise?
Lol he had 3 girlfriends while he was on the show. Genevieve found out after.
![gif](giphy|bfA9FfnIU5P0s)
My husband has been banking on seeing him, he’s apparently the funniest part! He wants the James x Aaron bromance to live on
😂😂
Yes, I’m surprised
I thought it was “I’m a lice gray” 😭
He actually did an ig Q&A a long time ago and said he never wants to go back. Maybe that’s because he was in this relationship though!
I get you sis, he’s among the hottest im my opinion .
He is the exact opposite of my type in every way and I actively disliked him on Katie's season, but man did my attraction to him grow strong watching both BiP seasons. Even as he acted like a total douche, lol. I was cheering for him and Gen even while it felt like watching my shittiest ever relationship play out live.
HAHA it does look like her
I thought this was Kaitlyn as well!!
James also has a steady gf.
When I clicked on Full Image, I was expecting to see Ron, even though that made no sense...
Literally my first thought! Was so confused for a sec why I was seeing Lana with this guy when she’s with Ron
Yes he soft launched a bit ago
Not that I can think of lol  Outside of the franchise the only other (famous-ish) Aaron C. I know is Aaron Carter but he is unfortunately deceased so that’s where my mind first went to after reading the title of this post. 🙊
Aaron B. and Aaron S. are on Charity’s season. Aaron B. is also Aaron C’s friend.
Are we talking about the same Aaron? He’s a full time influencer, hid two girlfriends before and during BIP, and the woman he just went public with has been verified since 2017.
😂 are u really talking about aaron clancy?
it is not gone
He was toxic in the first paradise too.
Because she paid $8?
She’s a singer I believe
https://i.redd.it/2ljnvbnf37sa1.gif  Oh
😂
I meant "victim" in a more sarcastic sense, just like having to deal with his behavior. But you're right, I edited it out!
That was my second read!!! And I was like “who names their kid LICE?”
The botox brows
😂 I am part of the love island sub and I literally had to double take at which sub this was posted to on my timeline because I seriously thought it was Lana involved in some cheating scandal 😂 “Lana gets outed for having a live in boyfriend while in the villa just weeks after her and Ron make it official” Lmaoo
He was dating as a single man like every other single man and I heard him saying he has a job still in San Diego while influencing. If he’s made enough to quit cool but he still went back home to his friends and found a normal love and I don’t see him constantly running to LA and bachelor events and other f list opportunities
The one and only
I was too curious and found her on Spotify, w 40K monthly listeners. Played the first song and lasted 10 seconds. Total crap!
LMAO, i legit was like wondering if they go to the same med spa lol
Nooo giving The Sun their next headline lol
He said [on Clickbait a month ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/thebachelor/comments/11fqqr5/aaron_cohosting_clickbait_this_week/) that he is unemployed and only influencing.  He was playing two women plus Genevieve, full stop. Reminders [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/thebachelor/comments/zh55xf/aaron_on_the_almost_famous_podcast) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/thebachelor/comments/ywv9hl/an_update_to_the_aaron_storyline).  His new gf is not in BN but is a singer who is verified.  He hasn’t been to any events or hangouts recently but has been to his fair share over the past 2 years. Lest we forget:  https://preview.redd.it/3vrnttjv47sa1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=76c518cb573605887e28b8fee6807e786d22c096
R u Aaron clancey?
That’s over TWO years. Some of these people have the same number of events in TWO months and I’m not including b day celebrations. I follow him and his mostly posts his same San Diego crew  His new gf is not BN as I said anyone can get a blue check. He has a blue check  You’re grasping for straws. A single man is allowed to date as many women as he pleases  He dated Genevieve on the show and they were a disaster. He would’ve been a fool to stay in that relationship. He chose someone else. That isn’t a crime.
I’m floored that Aaron’s immature, commitment-phobe fuckboy behavior actually has a defender. Hats off to you.
They all do the same things but somehow this fanbases choosing which ones are evil and wears blinders for some doing the same or worse
I listened to the podcast.. she was very hesitant to say anything because she new it would make a headline. She was talking about not wanting to go into business with another partner as she felt used in that relationship from her perspective.
“This is all just from my point of view and from how I felt and things that I saw,” she said.   “It doesn’t mean they’re right or wrong, but would you or would you not agree that when couples come off the show — whether it was a ‘Bachelor’ and the woman who picked or ‘Bachelorette and the guy she picked that’ — that is a really hard foundation to start on and a power struggle?”   This is such an interesting way to look at things from a lead’s perspective. Would make for a great discussion post on it’s own.
I feel like I’m sometimes hard on Kaitlyn about her Shawn mentions because she can be OTT about it and blame a lot on Shawn, but I listened to this pod and I actually didn’t mind this. I think she even said that this is just her side and how she personally felt, that there is another pov… she seemed hesitant to even say it because she knew it would be a headline   That said, it can be seen both ways. She feels like he used her, but maybe for him the gym was something he’d been working towards for awhile he likely knew the relationship was crumbling… he may have not wanted the break up to overshadow the opening which I get. He may have just wanted to get the opening before officially letting the relationship go. I’m not even saying that IS what happened, or kaitlyns POV is what happened… I really don’t know!! Just that everyone is gonna have their own feelings in it.
Free promo for his gym lol. Now some thirsty BN girlies in his city will pop by.
Anyone who saw the 4th of July pool party stories knows this is true. He definitely dragged the relationship on at the end.
hate to say it, but it was obvious. he dragged things out much longer than necessary. he still has his “boothstowes” highlight up on his instagram and for a long while after their breakup it was still one of the first highlights. the only reason it’s there is to make his ig analytics look better to potential brand partners. i said what i said.
Tbf this was just a tiny blip in that whole interview, Page Six just pulled out the one quote for a clickbait headline, she was just responding to one of Jason's questions
But…..many would say Jason is doing the same thing 🤔
As the biggest Shawn and Kaitlyn shipper when their season aired.. I sadly agree. Shawn really showed his true colors by the end. Yeah, he was always problematic but during the showing of Kaitlyns season it all felt more romantic than problematic but once the relationship had some years to it, you could tell it wasnt going away or ageing well.
Met him in 2020 and that man is even finer in person.  Just came here to say that.
Honestly? That's how it felt as a bystander too...🤷🏻‍♀️
It’s interesting seeing two people whose relationship is largely based on business talking on a business themed podcast about how one of them was used for business.
Somewhat unrelated but have Kaitlyn and/or Jason ever shared why they still live in Nashville? If I’m remembering correctly she moved out there for Shawn. Maybe it’s because I’m Canadian but I don’t get the appeal of Nashville?  ETA: not knocking Nashville but with her family in BC and his in NY, just seems odd to settle in Nashville 🤷‍♀️
Feels like there’s a lot of Shawn support here. I remember watching her season a couple of years ago after they broke up but before I knew much about him and he was red flag city the way he acted
I would never forget how he once said that their relationship was never love and that was more trauma bond!! Say what? That was so hurtful. They were together 3 years. Now looking back, it feels he stay longer because conveyance. The fact that either cant even say hi to each other says a lot.
I don’t know a whole ton about them, but I always got the feeling like they were a great match initially and then their goals in life diverged. Differing lifestyles and goals make it hard to move forward in a relationship, even with strong compatibility.
From the outside it always looked like that. Shawn cash out from that relationship and left… he was cruel.
The way Shawn reportedly reacted to Nick being named the Bachelor says everything you need to know about their relationship. Shawn said Nick ‘won’.  I don’t think he ever got over the feud he had with Nick on the show, and that was the downfall of the relationship with Kaitlyn.
Before commenting, did you guys get the context of how and why she said this? I just heard the clip and the assumptions/bs being sent her way tells me a lot of you didn’t 🙄
I never liked the guy, the way he acted on her season was red flag energy and I knew he will never move on from whole Nick thing & they won't last. So this sounds actually true.
I really hope this wasn't some kind of new revelation for Kaitlyn because it was pretty obvious Shawn lost interest at least a year before they actually broke up. Yeah, even after all her not so subtle wedding photo shoots and crying on lives.  At least this time around she's not doing more wedding photo shoots to move Jason along...yet.  But feels like history repeating itself because I believe there's maybe a 3% chance Jason and her will ever get married...
I definitely thought this at the time.
Did y’all even listen to the podcast to get the context for this?
She is not wrong in my opinion. He had his gym opening in June with Kaitlyn as special guest ,did group photo with Kaitlyn for VIP tickets and they broke up officially in September.
she's not wrong and she is free to talk about her life BUT she is publicly engaged, like the time to mudsling the ex publicly was a while ago. not something done by a healed person
He treated her like shit.
The comments on this post are exactly why people should listen (or read) before putting their two cents in.
Side note Kaitlyn looks completely different to me than on her season, I just watched it for the first time the past few weeks.
Why was her moving on 'disrespectful' to him? 🙄
If she thinks Shawn used her what does she think Jason is doing
wow, didn’t think of the timing at the time.. but it makes sense. How sad. I adored that relationship from the sidelines.
Does anyone else find it weird Shawn still has his collection of highlights with him and kaitlyn still on his Instagram profile?
I mean let’s face it he checked out before it opened
![gif](giphy|I16U5AfBWqgJYJum6i|downsized)
Kaitlyn will always be the victim in her own story and I can’t stand Shawn but guarantee she’ll be saying the same thing about Jason if they break up  ![gif](giphy|cKbFLuqYddZJppCnBB|downsized)
As Brooklyn would say....if the shoe fits, lace that bitch up.
she can discuss whatever she wants but kind of strange to even bring this up when you're engaged to someone else. i almost feel like the current relationship is having issues and this is just a way to divert attention away from the fact that they haven't gotten married. have they announced any details about planning? totally reasonable to keep that stuff quiet but they don't seem like the type to keep things private given the need to remain relevant. i'm not a devout listener to their podcasts so i may just have missed stuff.
and Kaitlyn’s using Jason and Jason is using her. Their relationship is built on business as they’ve said themselves and that’s what they prioritize so oh well
Why is she talking about him. It’s been years and she’s engaged to someone else. This makes her look bad not him
Well she’s not wrong
Omg why is she still talking about him?   Unpopular opinion probably but I have never felt like her relationship with Jason is genuine because she hasn’t seemed to moved on from Shawn. There’s always a new comment about him and it’s been, what? 4 years? Imagine how tired we are…
It’s giving Adam Collard from love island.
So the complaint is that Shawn used her for clout so his gym makes money when she’s using him for clout so her fiancé’s podcast makes money lol
Literally didnt even know he had a gym. Her mentioning him on the podcast has now created a page six article which will probably be the most free advertisement hes ever gotten
I love Kaitlyn but I don’t think Shawn used her at all. I genuinely think that he was there for her and that was very clear. I think Kaitlyn and Shawn would have actually worked if it wasn’t for the Nick situation. I genuinely feel like Shawn was super clear about his intentions by his support of her on the show that it was hard for him to “get over” what went on. Which truthfully I don’t really blame him, I also don’t blame her. I think that sometimes choices just come with consequences and the risk that Kaitlyn took, while it may have been the right choice for her I don’t think it was the right choice for the connection to Shawn, He’s still human. I sometimes think that the leads forget what it feels like to be the contestant and because they’re in the “position of power” they try to use it to their advantage but forget the real struggle on the other side. With that said, I think Kaitlyn did what she could to repair it after the show but I think that with being new to the public for both of them really, their goals/careers did become priority (as they should be) but it was hard to get back to that initial intensity and “innocence” of the relationship.   Personally. I really liked them together and I hate to say it, I think they were a better fit than her and Jason
She’s really being willfully blind about Jason huh? Because how is she still going on about Shawn while Jason strings her along?
Ma’am, this was almost 5 years ago. Why is this being dragged out (for publicity and headlines and more schilling)
This is only sus in the context of her saying it NOW after all this time. But she's not wrong lol.
This actually has so many different things going on in this. Maybe I need to listen to the whole podcast for context.   1. Why is Shawn brought up every once in awhile? Maybe it’s something she’s still working through.  2. Only she can know why she feels this way. She’s the only one that knows how the relationship was going when the gym was in the works and what happened afterwards.  3. How does Jason and her relationship compare. Because it seems like a wedding is prolonged once again, when she wants to be married.
Feels like she's just out there saying stuff to stay relevant lately.
Wooooo the tea 👀👀
She’s just trying to get headlines. I listened to the podcast and this sounded so rehearsed between her and Jason. Funny to complain about feeling used while simultaneously using your ex to stay relevant in headlines.
Move on girl. I don't go out there talking about how bad my ex hurt me. I'm moved on and happy.
[removed]
What’s wrong with her? She seriously has issues. How do you think her actual, current husband feels that his wife feels the need to create content by talking about her past boyfriend on air who (hopefully) she hasn’t spoken to or heard of or thought of in years. I’d question my partner why this person is even on their mind after you’ve been together for over 4 years.   Full disclosure: I think kaitlyn is my least favorite person to listen to or who continues to be active in the Bachelor/Bachelorette podcasts. I find her annoying and low brow. And that says something in the bachelor world.
Yes, she was very hesitant
Hesitant yet trashed him anyway
I’m guessing it must be really hard and obviously I wasn’t in that relationship, but with this show’s track record, a three year relationship is actually a big deal. I don’t know why she insists on thinking he only used her. Like, maybe they were not compatible in the end. If he really didn’t care for her he would’ve bounced after the 6 month mark like most guys do. Being on the show is still pretty lucrative if you make it far.   Idk. Maybe she’s looking back wondering if he ever did love her but I think he probably did? I never got the feeling that he didn’t. Any other guy would’ve left after the Nick thing.
Wow! The memory of those stories just came rushing back to me. I completely agree with you.
Do tellll
Spill the 🫖!
Anyone who watched her season. He was so dominating and manipulative
Wait that’s so weird that he still has the highlight up
Lol and she’s still using mentioning him to get coverage of their podcast episode.
Facts lol
😬
📠
I wonder which business he’s waiting to open
I’ve never felt more sure of it until listening to this very episode, ironically
Yeah he’s really hot 😅. He’s always been my BN crush.
He’s not my usual “type” but he is honestly so hot 🥵
I've heard that before! That he is much hotter in person.
Lmaoo  ![gif](giphy|KzyMcEfDh4Jiw)
Hahahaha
Only his brother is in NY. His parents live in either North or South Carolina so much closer to Nashville.
My understanding was that Nashville is becoming a little Hollywood.
I got the ick when she told him she slept with Nick and he kept wiping his mouth on his sleeve (or at least production edited it that way)
The worst
![gif](giphy|TdLNIOEbwshSSLSVvc|downsized)
What goals?
Seriously. Every other comment is a "why is she still talking about him?!" Like damn, watch the little clip and answer your own damn question fr
Exactly!!
Agreed. Their relationship was hard to watch. Yeah, I don't see her and Jason making it either :/ Which is unfortunate - I thought they had real potential at the beginning.
Yea I used to listen to her podcast around that time and it was rough :( she would try to spin some of the messed up things Shawn was doing as lovey dovey when it wasn’t. She was very complimentary of him until she finally was able to see how messed up their relationship was   Trigger warning: >! I haven’t forgotten the story of how he never had time to be intimate with but then only had sex with her while she was asleep and unconscious. She laughed it off but it was uncomfortable to listen to  !<
Girl, this is Reddit, where people take clickbait headlines and run with it lol
Nope, I rarely listen to any of the alumni’s podcasts.  I will say both Kaitlyn and Jason are Davy enough to know him asking and her answering would become clickbait.  Yet another instance of a relationship that places career above togetherness using their pasts to create buzz. Probably hoped more would listen.
You know the answer is no but people have to give their two cents!
You’d never know it was the same person if you didn’t know.
Asked by.. her long term live in boyfriend lmao.  Let’s not pretend there was an unbiased journalist there.
She knows what’s going to make the headlines. Let’s stop pretending like she doesn’t know how the media works and what gets picked up for articles. In the end, she has also done the same for Jason and when it’s all over, she will say the same thing about him. I don’t think it’s fair. In the Bachelor world everyone takes advantage of business opportunities and they should. I feel like she didn’t want him to get anything from the show except for her, which is unrealistic, and she’s made similar comments in the past about how she needed Shawn to “take the backseat.”   I think she’s forever salty about him and she always felt insecure about him leaving and having something that wasn’t tied to her but that’s selfish. This show literally changes lives. He can start his own business too.
You can choose to be graceful and say no comment
⬆️⬆️ cold lol
If anything, Jason is way more shameless because they started advertising their relationship literally from date 1 and as soon as possible.   I think everyone knows that being part of a golden couple means getting more money and relevance, so why be upset? One day she’ll talk about Jason in a similar way because she wants men to think they owe her everything when they all made it far on the show and they can all start the same businesses and things. I feel like she needs to be needed and recognized 24/7. We all know that.
There’s definitely an argument for this, however I do think Jason had more of his own stuff going before he and kaitlyn started dating? He had already been successful as well, but maybe in building up his own brand and podcast etc more..?
💯
Yes but I’m someone who deletes all ex pics.
Ew, John mayor
To he fair so is Jason lmao
Yea agree.
Absolutely
its strange they arent actually married yet
When did they say that about their relationship?
Facts
She was answering what Jason asked and it wasn't even about making anyone look bad since she specifically said its only her POV and it doesn't mean its right or wrong.
This is the take I have.
I think she’s totally moved on from Shawn, it just so happens that she’s dating a guy that she was never into as much as she was into Shawn at the time. That’s why you see such a contrast.
This fall will mark 4 years since they officially broke up.
It was a question that she was asked
Its not just a random Ex she dated for 2 months. The two she talks about are big part of her life, she was engaged to one for 3 years and dated the other ones for 3+ years. If she stops talking about them, they wont disappear from her life and story.
You must not follow him on SM because it’s 99% of his posts.
If you listen to the podcast, she said he used her at the end not the entire relationship. I feel like some of you haven't listened to what she actually said. She said in her perspective, she felt like he dragged the relationship for a bit longer at the end till he opened the gym. If you were following them 5 years ago, you would know that he had his gym opening in June and special guest was Kaitlyn and they officially broke up in September. Its not crazy if she feels used at the end which is what she said and mentioned its only her perspective, doesnt mean shawn doesn't have his own POV.
Lol what?? I do not think he's stringing her along at all
The question was asked why she doesn’t want to go into business with a romantic partner, and so she talked about the relevant experience that shaped her decision. People don’t stop being impacted by some thing when time has gone by. Intelligent people learn from it and use it to make them wiser. Why should she pretend that part of her life didn’t happen?
At the same time you have to wonder what’s Jason doing because……
It was a really fun podcast they had great chemistry in it - Jason asked her if she felt used before professionally and she said she did feel used in her relationship with Shawn BUT she said ,that was only her “ opinion /feeling “ didn’t make it right or wrong , which was exactly right to say and of course the clickbait headlines don’t add that part . She was inside the relationship and if she felt used then that was her perception regardless of what others think.
I think it’s normal when you’ve been burned in a relationship to hold some resentment towards the person and the situation. Hence her bringing him up every once in a while. Now if she was to talk obsessively about him I would be concerned but that’s not the case here.
You need to listen, with context it makes sense. It was a good episode IMO
She was asked if she was used professionally and she answered in one sentence. These articles make their money by making these headlines without the actual context.
You’re getting downvoted to hell and I’ll join you, but she will never stop being salty about Shawn because she didn’t want to break up.
Tell me you didn’t listen to the podcast without telling me you didn’t listen to the podcast
This thread isn't about her looks, and also it's not anyone's business. DON'T COMMENT ON OTHER PEOPLE'S BODIES. Stay in your own business and GTFO of Kaitlyn's. You should be SUPPORTIVE of women, not tearing them down. Shame on you. Judge not lest ye be judged.
Lol... Jason asked her this question. She wasn't randomly mentioning him. He clearly feels secure and fine with it. You clearly didnt care to even know the context of this conversation.
They’re not married
Low brow? This comment is so gross.
She didnt say he used her the entire relationship. If you listened to the actual interview, she said at the end of the relationship. She said he dragged the relationship longer until he opened his gym which she is not wrong. He opened the gym in June and Kaitlyn was his special guest for opening and they were done in September. Its not that surprising that Kaitlyn feels used from her own perspective at the end.
Yeah this seems like revisionist history. Which is kinda on brand for Kaitlyn.
What happened in those stories?
yup. he’s still cashing in on their relationship, but these comments will have you believe kaitlyn is the desperate one.
This should be an even bigger story than the original post! Wtf? I would feel sooo weird if my ex still had a highlight reel of our relationship up years after we were over. It’s soooo obvious the reason he did this 🙄
Ohh gotcha
From my very limited perspective, it didn’t seem like they were on the same page about lifestyle, marriage & kids and what their future should/would look like. Those ticket items are hard to compromise on. I could be totally off base, but it just felt like initially they were a good match and really in love, but after some years their fundamental differences started to make the relationship crack.
Ok so I listened, and what happened is she was asleep, woke up, and discovered he had a hard -on, and she was in the mood. Definitely not as bad as I thought
He did WHAT?!
WHAT THE FUCK WHEN DID SHE DISCUSS THIS?!?
The fuck!!! 1. That’s messed up. 2. How did she find out??? Did she wake up or something mid act? That’s traumatizing!!
WHAT THE FUCK WHEN DID SHE DISCUSS THIS?!?
EXCUSE HIM WHAT!!?
It's wild. After many years, people still dont listen or even care to know the context. Just ready to pile on
I didn't watch her season and that photo in the mag looks nothing like her! I think her eye makeup is a big part of it.
This lol
I did not listen to the podcast, but why TF was Jason asking about Shawn?   Honestly, Shawn and Kaitlyn burned hot and cold. Extreme passion or extreme hurt.  Comparatively Jason seems like the nice stable guy she is trying to settle for
And Kaitlin used her success on the show as clout, and being in a BN couple that got engaged on the show
I agree! And the way Jason shamelessly talks about money makes me think he has done all the calculations in his head of how beneficial this relationship is for his brand.
She is not upset. She said thats why she won't go in business with a partner caus she has felt used in the past. That was the point of it and she said thats her POV. You clearly didnt even care to listen what was truly said on the podcast , just read the clickbait and project your own feelings into it which is fine i guess.
Shawn didn’t have a gym, but he did have a whole lot of fitness stuff. I think he did custom programs and stuff. I would argue he was in a similar spot.
I mean he’s her long term partner, I’m sure they discussed the podcast questions in advance. I guess they decided talking about him together would make press — so I guess they are making money off her association with him now.   I wonder if in three years, she’ll be saying Jason used her for clout too
Nope, I never followed him. He was a bit too moody and sullen for my taste.
I guess my feeling is if he was not giving her what she needed or wanted, she could have ended it too.  I liked them as a couple, but agree that sadly her involvement with Nick were too much for him.I am not blaming her. I just think it would have been a vastly different season and outcome if they did not let Nick come on.
I think he doesn’t want to marry her and he knows that and won’t tell her that. It doesn’t take men this long at that age to know.
But going on each others podcasts is very similar to Shawn having her as the special guest for his gym’s grand opening. She wasn’t an investor in the gym was she?
The same thing 🫣🤭. At this point Kaitlyn wasting her own time though lol 🤷🏾‍♀.
Inside the article they do make mention of Kaitlyn stating it’s from her perspective and that’s how she felt. Honestly, she probably has her reasons for feeling like that. It’s interesting. The context that’s missing imo is how Jason asked her if she’s ever felt used professionally. They also mentioned reaching out to Shawn. I doubt Shawn would say anything about it.
That’s what I’m thinking. I saw this article and thought I’d share, but was thinking the article doesn’t offer more insight that might be useful.  Edit: I don’t get what’s so wrong about this comment. I found the article, I shared it. I don’t listen to podcasts, just like many others, so of course I know context could be missing. The article doesn’t really bash Kaitlyn or Shawn. It just says she said on a podcast that she feels that way and even acknowledges that it’s her point of view and how she felt.
Lol
This is a very aggressive response, lol. I’m a big fan of Kaitlyn’s and have been from the beginning. I’m not judging her at all. I’m feeling empathetic towards how she sees herself. I can be supportive of her and recognize that she doesn’t see herself as the beautiful women she was. (Not that she isn’t pretty now, but she never needed work done.)
Ha! Well that makes sense to me. I feel sorry for that guy. Thanks for correcting.
She was fucking wastedddddd and Shawn didn’t look like he was having fun. And afterwards it was discussed how Shawn essentially had to drag her out of the end of the party cause she didn’t want to leave (Miley Cyrus’s) and carry her to a cab. There was lots of speculation that this was the final straw for them, Kaitlyn later talked about july being when things went downhill for good.
Also curious
They’re both benefitting. She uses their relationship for filler on her podcast him on his ig. That seems fair tbh
What specifically were they not on the same page about?  They both still live in the same town and do the same things...
Kaitlyn talked about this on a podcast some years ago both Carly and Jade were on that episode as well  Why am I getting downvoted this is not made up it’s true
A long time ago when she was still with Shawn. Carly and Jade were also on that episode they were discussing intimacy after having children and KB talked about her situation
I was able to find the podcast episode if anyone wanted to listen https://open.spotify.com/episode/5UI45yhg5OpyyhEOdIIj7u?si=gM1diUOFT1G8j9I6xuJHiw&context=spotify%3Ashow%3A4WU7Yb47KNvqRCubDBRzr0&dd=1
I gotta give you props. Out here doing the work, trying to educated people with their wild takes based on a clickbait headline.   Only a few bother to listen to the actual podcast and it becomes hot takes about who likes Kaitlyn vs not, who likes Shawn vs not. It's got nothing to do with the substance. You deserve massive props for your effort!
Oh, that picture doesn’t even look like she did during her season. She has gone through some evolutions to say the least.
She wasn't talking about the entire relationship. If you listened to the podcast, she said specifically at the end when he opened the gym caus it was pretty clear. He opened the gym in june (Kaitlyn was his special guest for opening and meet/great with Kaitlyn for VIP holders) and they broke up in September. She has the right to feel that way at the end.
If you listened to the interview, you would know they absolutely didn't discuss questions in advance. This conversation came up when Kaitlyn was discussing not doing business with a partner caus she had bad experience. She might be, it depends on how things will go. She didnt say Shawn used her the entire relationship, she specifically mentioned she felt used at the end and its only how she feels. Shawn could have different POV.
I actually dont think outcome would have been different in long term. They have different lifestyles and hobbies. It was pretty obvious how they liked different things after year 1. Ofcourse she could have ended it which is why she said Shawn has his own POV as well, she specifically said thats how she felt at the time and it doesn't mean if its right or wrong.
He doesn't :/ I feel for her.
If Jason breaks up with Kaitlyn right after she did his podcast, she probably would feel used too. She said she felt used at the end of the relationship with Shawn caus Shawn stayed longer just to open the gym and be done with her. She also specifically said thats how she felt which she has every right to feel that way. I was following Kaitlyn/Shawn 5 years ago as well, you can even go and look at his page, he posted about Kaitlyn working out at his gym while promoting his gym literally days before he broke up with her. Dont you think she has the right to feel certain ways?
It’ll dawn on her when her followers hit her with the “if you wanted to you would” when all these BN weddings start rolling in 😶
What was the context of reaching out to Shawn? lol
You attacked her looks for no reason. It's no one's business but hers. You're no fan of hers with comments like this body shaming her. This thread isn't about that, yet you felt the need to comment. That says more about you than anything 🤷🏻‍♀️  Anyway, I'm not interacting with you further.
Do you realized she was a guest on "that guy" podcast where "that guy" asked her this question and she answered? You dont need to feel sorry for a guy who is secure with his partners previous public relationship.
Successful long term relationships are much more complex then “living in the same town” and “doing the same things”. Like I said, I could be off base, I don’t know them personally, but they did not seem to be on the same page with foundational things which created cracks in their relationship; possibly their perspectives on marriage, perspectives on kids, family, religion, politics etc. Could be any number of things.
Seven minutes in, and Liz, Jade, And Carly give such mean girl vibes
Appreciate the kind words. Sorry you are getting downvoted for just being nice to me.
I’m not saying she’s wrong to feel however. It’s just super weird to bring it up years later on a podcast with your current fiancé.  I guess they decided that was the best way to make headlines and get listens - ironically.
I think when articles write about something they like to reach out for opinion to people being discussed. The article just says they reached out to Shawn for comment and didn’t get a response.
Americans don't go on enough vacations, so good for her for going against the grain. Seriously many people in Europe and Australia vacation for 4-6 weeks every year.
Ppl are wild. This is just another version of “influencers need to get a real job”. Except she has a real job, so I guess now ppl are going after her for traveling and enjoying life??
People are just bitter and jealous.
People are just jealous lol they wish they could vacation that much
she’s my fav bachelorette
It’s wild to me people care what others do with their money. If she wants to take a vacation every week that’s her business. She’s not spending anyone else’s money is she? I think I would get jealous if these were constant vacations paid for by sponsors, because how do I get that type of hook up? 😂
The second slide gets a little too “easy for rich people to say” to me, but any mean comments she was getting about vacationing no doubt come from envy, in which case people should just unfollow.
Not gonna lie, I noticed she’s away a lot, mostly because I’m envious!
What is this in response to?
People are mad that she goes on vacation a lot? Sounds like that Gin Blossoms song  🎶🎶 hey jealousy 🎶🎶
Lol crazy that people complain about too much vacation. There’s no such thing as too much if you can afford it.  Also can confirm, I’m in Europe and last year I did vacations in the Alps, Spain, Holland, Belgium, Iceland, Greece, Germany, Japan and France and I still felt I travelled pretty little compared to what I was aiming for.
That’s not a fair comparison. It costs $150 to get a round trip ticket from Paris to Italy, Italy to Spain, Spain to a Greece - you catch my drift. The cost of east coast to Europe in most places will be no less than $700 on a lucky day.   Y’all will say it’s jealousy but as someone who travels a few times a year with my own hard earned money, it’s definitely expensive and but I’d never reply this post to a friend that said something to me about how much I’m gone (which isn’t often, I’m deff not an IG influenced lol), but I’d be honest about my sacrifices to show what I had to trade essentially for these trips.   This post comes off as “I’m a rich white woman and I’m sorry you’re poor. Maybe you should go work harder.” The reality is 70% of women on this sub probably bust their ass 10x harder than she does and can hardly afford their mortgage payment. She should have just kept her Twitter fingers to herself because honestly this comes off really bitchy.
I'm not rich, and I agree with her
She's just been on vacation for a few days with her kids followed by a few days with her bf. I assume the back to back holiday triggered people who told her she's always on vacation.. So yesterday she did a day in the life of a regular day and reiterated that what you see on SM is just a highlight reel.  These slides were after the end of her day in the life stories last night.
What a throwback. Spotify says they are apparently on tour rn???
ICELAND and JAPAN in one year PLUS the rest?! Jesus I am not even ashamed to say I’m positively green with envy
I need to know more!  I’m a fairly well and often traveled American, but I am always blown away by how much some Europeans travel and how much time they have off.
work 10x harder than she does? She’s a pediatric dentist. She does several dental procedures and surgeries in a day. She shared her patient calendar as part of her day in the life. Remember she has a small dentistry practice, so she’s the only person running it (management, financial pressure to provide, professional standard to keep, etc). I doubt 70% of any people are working “harder than her”. Be for real right now.
The Iceland vacations I have to plan regularly, I'm from there originally and so I visit family + do touristic things with my non-Icelandic partner. Going again in July. :)       Japan was amazing though, never been anywhere like it! I find myself missing it every month, I badly want to go back but the longhaul flight feels a bit rough!
Where I'm at, this year I have 10 bank holidays, 5 "bridge days" (closed-office days due to bank holidays happening on a Tuesday or Thursday). On top of this, I have paid 25 vacation days, and accumulated overtime also gets taken out as vacation.  This works out to 40+ vacation days a year, which I can arrange over weekends and/or bank holidays completely as I like. I also have a flexible job where I can work remotely as much as I want, and thus do for example a 2 week Iceland trip with 1 week home office and 1 week off.  Flying is cheap within Europe of course on top of this, so it allows you to discover the countries around here quite easily whereas flying to some place like Japan can get quite expensive. For this reason I've mostly travelled within Europe, with a little branching out to Asia and an Africa trip high on my bucket list now that I make enough money to afford such trips.  Never been to the US though, though not for lack of opportunity - mostly I'm uninterested in travelling there.
lol thank you for this   I’m sure ashley is busting her behind just as much as another working professional! (if not more)   i don’t understand why people are upset about her going on vacations.
Man, Greg really had us thinking he was the insecure underdog on Katie’s season
He looks incredibly New Jersey here
this Greg is definitely from new jersey

![gif](giphy|24qpFnJ04vk2I)
Greg’s hair is definitely the thing that turns him from mediocre white dude to hot this pic confirms 💀  ETA: omg I posted this before I read comments and I’m shook y’all actually think he’s super hot here haha.
Now hold on…  https://i.redd.it/v73meyt136sa1.gif
This is so New Jersey coded
Oh my god I was fully expecting all these comments to be like “wow thank god he doesn’t look like this lame jersey bro now.”  This is the first time I have ever said this sincerely, but these comments have me SHOOK.
Yikes, looks like the guy with a rap album on SoundCloud from your high school. And yes most of it is the n word.
Uh, how old is he here?
OP you are not getting enough credit for your Channing Tatum in Shes the Man comparison. Top notch 😂
meryl streep method acting is out of control
Lol this is like the opposite of his aesthetic now
Malibu’s Most Wanted 😌
Omg this makes so much sense
This goes to show what a beautiful head of hair can do to change an appearance. He looks so different in this pic.
I look at this picture and I can smell it, like I know what This Guy’s bedroom smells like cause every “This Guy’s” room smells the same and I think some of you understand what I am trying to say here and I hope someone will admit it but that also means admitting that enough guys like this got you to go to their room that you started putting it all together
Okay I definitely would have had a crush on him in highschool. DAMN IT.
Such fuck boi energy omg
he looks like he says the N-word here
Two words Jersey fboy
Lord, people do change, I would never guess it's him lol.
As a 33 yr old, I feel wrong just looking at this.
He looks like Chet hanks to me
This explains why he is a f-boy
Looks like a kid who calls girls sluts but I dunno just my opinion
Never seen this movie but I don’t need to, to know you’re totally spot on with this resemblance OP
He looks like such a NJ bro. I can't get over it. Like I've hooked up with this type of Greg before 😅.
so Jersey
With the shaved head he looks like Mal from Shadow and Bone. Super weird.
Who is this man
That’s an insult to Channing Tatum in that iconic role tbh
My downfall is that this is my type
There are a lot of thirsty comments in here, how old is he in this photo? Feels a bit creepsville.
It looks like a freaking face swap it’s so weird
![gif](giphy|wtyYMNeJNlkAM)  who the fuck is this that is NOT greg grippo...???
Man, hair really does make a difference😂😂😂
Oh please don’t you do Channing Tatum that way  ![gif](giphy|shadLrRxdwZvq)
This is how every guy I know from the jersey shore looks LOL
Seeing this picture makes it actually make sense that he’s from New Jersey
I immediately thought that when I saw his story lol This Greg was attractive but I also think his current look is attractive. I never understood people who say he’s not attractive 🤷🏽‍♀️
THIS is no Channing... but I don't find Grippo at all attractive.
Thought this was young Vin Diesel….Reddit automatically cuts off the top of his head before I click on the image 😭
He looks like he'd be such a mean high schooler
my toxic trait is that high school me absolutely would have given high school Greg a blowjob underneath the school bleachers
I thought for sure the comments would be filled with people saying this gave them the ick or they’re so glad he looks different now. Not people saying they would have sex with what looks to be teenage Greg? Y’all are gross
![gif](giphy|26hkhKd2Cp5WMWU1O|downsized)
ohhhh high school me definitely would have tried to makeout with him at a party... and I'm not even a Grippo girl🫣
major jump scare
Are y’all actually into this?? Ew
LMAO THIS WAS MY EXACT THOUGHT
He looks like Pete Davidson here😂 Is it Staten Island/NJ fashion or smth
Im dying
It’s so funny, because it’s so meta, but he doesn’t realize it yet. In ten years, today’s post will seem cringe to him. And repeat every ten years until death😂
He looks like a baby in this pic
https://preview.redd.it/cz8zoxyqw5sa1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a1a00c79b9f7bc686716a35ab61dbefed05f78b4
You can’t tell me that’s not mr potato head
UO: he was hotter here
High school me would’ve gladly given him my V card, just sayin 🤷🏻‍♀️
Tatum is about a foot taller
Be SO for real right now. I’m begging 😭
I get weird ‘american x’ cast member from this.
It’s giving Jake in Jarhead
Whew 🥵
Wait damn. He's looking kinda good lol   ![gif](giphy|814TFkMQTwVlxohtnG)
Def just threw up in my mouth a little
Did he do steroids?? Because idk about this pic
I am looking 👀
I don’t find him attractive at all now, but this pic is 🥵
He looks better with the short hair
💯
People change year to year.
yeah i feel like he’s giving early jersey shore vinny
He looks like one of Tony Soprano’s younger guys.
That’s a ripped 10-11 year old lol the math ain’t mathin
The juxtaposition of the baby face with those crazy abs is tew much
Pls why is he flashing us 😂
Jesus why is he so ripped 😂
11 lol. Edited because my math sucks
This muscular baby is too much for my brain to comprehend
Honestly, this pic makes me feel really sad for some reason? Like I can only imagine how self-conscious he was at this age and to feel the need to post a pic like this for validation... ☹️ Maybe it's the mom in me, but I just wanna give him a hug and tell him it's all gonna be okay
Iconic.
Agreed! I think Greg is so so hot in the present time but he legit looks like and might be a teenager in this pic so I am shocked at the comments in this thread.
It actually baffles me how many women don’t like men with hair lol it’s really hard for me to be attracted to someone with a shaved head. Like they won’t look bad to me but they look soooo mediocre imo.  But then a lot of women love facial hair and I can do without that 🤷🏽‍♀️
Wait really?? I hate the greasy looking hair on boys lol
I'm sorry this GIF is so funny
I’m listening
But which expression are you?
You are not alone.
&#x200B;  https://i.redd.it/rrdgzmq0e6sa1.gif
I believe it was taken when he was either training in the summer for college. My guess 17,18,19. It's from the place where he posted his recruitment video so people should be cautious lol.
🥰
Axe body spray and dirty laundry, we get it
😂😂😂
yep. Same lol
💀💀😭😭😭😭 I can't
Average white boy from the jersey suburbs
“*females*” energy
You're missing out. I recently rewatched it. 2000's were great film years. That movie still slaps. Watch it 😅
All he needs is a tattoo of a cross and his family crest
Woah ! You’re right !
He was Katie Thurston’s F3 a couple years ago  Edit: F3* typo. should have been F1 we all know it lmao
Contrasted with the post about Natalie below... 🤔
I'm one of them. He just.. isn't to me. The only thing I actually like about him IS his hair now. I just don't like his face?
Omgggg lmao  ![gif](giphy|tfUW8mhiFk8NlJhgEh|downsized)
☠️🤣🤣🤣
![gif](giphy|eeicndnfjl55IgMqUE)
high school me would have been willing but he’d have none of it 😂
SCREAMINGGGG
😭😭😭😭 the funniest shit I read
Same!
as someone from new jersey, unfortunately yes lmao
😂😂😂
I agree haha I don’t think he’s attractive in his current aesthetic
This is the first time I’ve found Greg attractive
No, steroids look damn huge and so cartoonish. Idk how to explain it, but when a man is on steroids he looks so unreal. Like Popeye. The muscles do this really weird thing around the joints. Like they’re balloons or something. Idk how to explain it 😂  ![gif](giphy|90PPv7eqekhrO)
Stop it lol
Ma'am thats a child
😂😂😂
Same! The body dysmorphia starts at a young age :(
Same bald men are really just hmmm. I do occasionally see guys who look good or even better with shaved hair but it's rare
He looks so much better with the buzz cut idk  https://i.redd.it/7vxdfigat6sa1.gif
Eliza 😭
Yeah, it was a bad joke
F3. Justin was F2.
Oh I agree! Just because he looks kind of young in this pic
Lol no. You can take steroids and look like greg here. They don't automatically make you balloon up unless you take a LOT. It's impossible to say whether he's on gear or not in this pic.
Does anyone remember the weird ghost pottery promo they did for him?🤣
I’d be so embarrassed tbh if all of america knew how many times I did the deed in a windmill of all places
This cannot be real. This feels like another lifetime
Back when ABC actually shelled out money for promos! Remember Hannah B.’ epic promo? Now we get Katie wearing a bad Tshirt.
Bring back the cheesy yet amazing promos
The windmill 💀 They play too much
These truly were the golden years 😂
Honestly the PEAK time for the Bachelor & Bachelorette
That first rose petal looked like a red flag at first. Would’ve been appropo.
The Pete promos were next level wow
Peter and Hannah’s seasons will always be my favorite. So much mess
He landed that plane and got into the castle real fast!
The CGI 💀
Does anyone else think that the bachelors used to be pretty handsome in the early seasons, but they are so mehhhh in the more recent years? Am I the only one who just does not find these guys hot at all? (Peter, Nick Viall, Arie, Matt James, Zach)  Im not super knowledgeable in the bachelor nation so maybe this is already a popular topic but I haven’t personally seen anyone mention it
Not the windmill 😅😅😅😅
Peter and Hannah B truly had the best promos
I hate that Hahahahhaha
This was the last season I watched!
![gif](giphy|UpE1NjTgHEazZ3Ynps|downsized)
Hannah Ann 🥰🥰🥰
And Charity gets that lame Barbie meme made on canva. Love itttt.
I posted that last week !
Lmao yes
I cannot remove that promo from my mind. 😂 #neverforget
All I could think of is how many spiders were in there
![gif](giphy|JrLmVs0bp0FYDShhKc)
Honestly I think Peter and Matt are the hottest bachelors they have ever had. Esp their voices 👌
I don’t think that was her official promo
Omg is that why it’s been on my mind? 🤣 lmao
Thanks for posting this one too! Do leads usually get 2 promos?
![gif](giphy|xk5vxDNaIhvzpWQzdT|downsized)
Yeah, it’s not. It’s a new trend after the Barbie movie posters were released.
I think PP is the only one
I was neutral and occasionally complementary so I think I’m safe lmao
I’d be surprised if Zach and Kaity both still have their jobs a year from now  Edit: as in I think they will pursue the “opportunities” that come with the show, not as in I think they will get fired lol
UO: Zach is my type of Bachelor assuming he stays together with Kaity. I want male leads who are ready & willing to get married. Same for the Bachelorette. That’s why I wasn’t into Gabby, Katie, Pete, Hannah, Matt - those ppl weren’t ready to get married!
I liked Zach's seasons a lot. I'm happy for them.
I don’t think anyone needs to apologize but he’s right. People wanted romance romance romance a Sean season romance blah blah blah. You got what you were asking for. Him and Kaity are cute as shit
UO: He’s not wrong about the audience
I honestly don’t think viewers were even that mean to Zach. Most were just bored by him and the season. And he deserved criticism for exposing the sex life of his F2 to make himself feel better. People have been much meaner to prior leads. I mean more people flipped out on Katie for wearing a tshirt than they did Zach for anything.
Some of peoples favorites over Zach were ridiculous because they were obvious clout chasers avoiding commitment and had little hope of producing a couple that even made it to the finale
Zach could keep his job forever, never influence, and marry Kaity and people don’t owe him an apology. I hope everything that’s good happens to him and Kaity, they’re just not people that are exciting or that I gravitate towards.
Nothing that I dislike about Zach has anything to do with his current relationship to kaity lol.
I’m absolutely obsessed with how all coverage of this show (from ABC affiliates and beyond) shits on the BN audience constantly.  I’ve never seen another television show whose relevant figures were so utterly obsessed with policing the negative reactions of its audience!   *NOTE: of course I’m not talking about the toxic DMing and threatening that some rabid fans engage in— that is horrible and should be called out. But we actually don’t owe the franchise or its stars our unbridled praise and attention!*
I wish him nothing but the best but I will absolutely not be apologizing!  https://preview.redd.it/j6sabsu4j5sa1.jpeg?width=1136&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5c219afd51fc6e4eb4683f2c931498bc53ee6cbb
I never disliked him. I thought he made mistakes but who of us hasn’t?
Who is this man 💀
You can check off all the requirements to be a “good” bachelor but that still doesn’t mean people will like him. I think Zach is fine and I wish him and Kaity well!   But at the end of the day you can’t fake charisma. That’s always been the missing factor for Zach. At least for me personally. Even though we’ve had other “bland” bachelors, he is one of the few who came off particularly blah for a lot of people. Not a bad person. Just meh. It is what it is.
I kinda agree with this take. People knocked him for being too bland a lead but for me he was sincere.
![gif](giphy|VCQnD4NgT8SagovnGQ|downsized)
GUYS, HE’S MAKING *A JOKE*. HE’S A COMEDIAN bruh 🤣
I’m not apologizing for shit 😂 I wish he and Kaity the best and hope everything works for them, but he still treated a few of the women kind of terribly and I stand by pointing that out.
He’s not wrong. The audience complained that Zach sent women home too quickly, but those same people also complained that Clayton had no spine when it came to drama.  Relationships are messy, and so is reality TV, so you get ultimate mess when you combine the two. Enjoy it even if the contestant ain’t perfect. I thought Zach was better than Clayton, and he seems to be able to joke about himself now that his season finished airing.
I think Zach should apologize to *me*.
I’m not apologizing for shit LMAO but! he makes a point that no matter who they pick, some ppl are gonna find a problem to have 🤷🏾‍♀️
the only thing that irked me was the lack of empathy in alot of the conversations HOWEVER i find the leas roll extremely stressful. so i will cut him some slack that it's probably hard to phone it in with 15 different relationships. making out with a bunch of people probably isn't hard, but having to nuture a bunch of relationships is probably exhausting and you know he probably figured out his final few women pretty early on
I mean I hope they make it, but Zach is far from my  dream bachelor 🤷🏻‍♀️
I really don't give a flying fuck whether or not these men get engaged or married or whatever. I don't watch reality TV to see people being rational   Bring on the Pilot Petes (from a diverse range of backgrounds)
Zach does not meet the criteria to be my "dream bachelor."   My dream bachelor is not a boring 26 year old white guy whose main source of appeal is that he wants kids and played football, and was rude to the lead on his season (<-- this is why Ben Flajnik shouldn't have been the lead, and its also why Zach shouldn't have been the lead.  If you cant put yourself in the lead's shoes, you shouldn't be the lead).   My dream bachelor is a handsome, emotionally intelligent, curious (and ideally intelligent) man, in his late 20s or early 30s who has had at least one long term post-college relationship and has dated women with a variety of ethnic/racial backgrounds. I dont care what their race is, but racial diversity in casting is a plus.    I can think of a LOT of men from recent seasons who appear to meet this criteria, but Zach was not one of them.   From the Windecchia season: Aven, or Ethan or Quincey (though BOTH would need a good run on on Paradise first)   From Michelle's season: Rick, Rodney  From Katie's Season: Dr Joe, Andrew  There may be others, and I dont follow any of these people outside of the show, so my opinion is exclusively about what we've seen on the show.
I mean Zach might say he wants all that but he’s also 26 and this show has a terrible track record for relationships so we’ll see
...Yeah I'm not going to apologize for posting criticism of Zach on Reddit for outing his night with Gabby and leaving her open to all the hate and slut shaming that comes with that.  ![gif](giphy|w48WeMIN73QsM)
My qualm was that Zach was a boring choice compared to other contestants and I still stand by that
Do not say Zach is my dream bachelor lmao absolutely not
Zach was fine, just not that interesting as a person. I wouldn’t want to hang out with the guy, but it doesn’t make him a bad person or even a bad lead. It was a good season compared to the last few bachelor seasons. People don’t owe him an apology because most people don’t mind him.
Hashtag not my bachelor
I really like Zach and some of the Bachelorette who went to the show for marriage, but the keeping your job this can change anytime I don't care about that but don't go to the show if you just want a clouds because the show is about love and marriage.
I think Zach showed a lot of manipulative and emotionally immature qualities, and for that reason I’m out
Yeah, no thanks. I’ll maybe apologize when he apologizes to Rachel R for shading her throughout his entire season of the bachelor. Also, he probably needs to go back to work. Looks like he doesn’t have a lot of followers to be a FT influencer.   Truly wish him and Kaity the best though.
We need representation and the franchise has failed to provide that representation. I wasn’t personally mean to Zach but I refused to watch his season.
Hannah’s a weird case for me. Because unlike the other leads you listed who we all know never intended to get married, I think Hannah did go into it wanting marriage and just wasn’t remotely mature enough for it.
Maybe production needs to find people that are actually of the age/life stage to get married after spending less than 72 hours with a person
Yes. I want the romance folks, not the clout chasers!!
You took the words out of my mouth, Zach was exactly what I wanted from a lead, and this makes the love story so much more believable and easy to root for!
Agree with THIS... don't waste our time using the show to get famous, knowing full well you don't want to get married. I am a Tayshia fan, but I also sort of think she knew she wasn't going to marry anyone from her season and planned to level up after (but picked one to "do the show" the right way... I think a lot of leads are like "well, does it matter, as long as the show makes me rich after?"... I feel like the leads and most contestants aside from the top 2 favorites are the LEAST invested in getting engaged, and rather hoping to make bank, and the top 2 (if they like the lead) are the most hopeful this turns into something, because otherwise they wasted their time lasting so long and getting just some sponsorships for it.
I absolutely loved the season, too. It was exactly what I wanted for the stories. I don’t think he’s my dream bachelor though, because I’m already made to my dream bachelor 😉
People were calling him controlling, a sociopath, saying "the mask dropped" implying he was abusive...he deserved criticism but people were incredibly OTT about every minor slip he made.
Zach was chosen because he wants that romantic ending. And I’m honestly glad they chose him based on how this season turned out
Its the thing I like best about him.  Next best is his great taste in truly awesome women.  (Kaity, Gabi, Ariel, Charity are all amazing).
This whole sub shits on itself constantly. Everyone knows the fanbase is toxic as hell.
The only thing I've seen resembling it is pro wrestling fandom.
Unbridled praise and attention, absolutely not. But there is a vast area between this and the constant pile ons that happen that are often overblown, which is made obvious in most cases by the fan base eventually liking or neutral towards that person.  All it takes is a paradise edit, a cute happy relationship, or for time to pass when we learn more about what really happened on set.
Everyone and anyone has made mistakes
Jared Fried lmao he’s my fave Bach commentator!! he’s freaking hilarious go watch his recaps from the season on his Instagram
How dare you disrespect the wizard of ha
Worst charisma ever in a bachelor was Chris Soules and Zach didn't even come close to that level of bad. A lot of personality gets edited out. For example, Gabby was funny and strong on her season and most of what we got while she was bachelorette was "yeah".  Zach's brand of awkwardness is something I like. No, it wasn't the most exciting season ever, but I actually have hope for him and Kaity.
He was all zeroed in on the goal. Didn’t particularly like his take with what Greer said in their call. But, being focused on a goal is not “bland”. That’s the point of the show.    Charisma levels are all edits. I mean we got so much more from him during his Bach season than we did during the Gabchel season
People think sincere and focused is “bland”
![gif](giphy|QBurxgHmS9EPCYf8ej|downsized)
Agree
Zach was way better than Clayton. He was decisive and he stuck with his decisions.
Yeah, it’s entertaining to an extent. But, I don’t want rose ceremonies from hell every effin season
Thank god someone gets it
> Andrew   I would not qualify him as emotionally mature by any means. This is a guy who parses out the little difference between exclusive and “boyfriend” so he can continue to be a fuck boy. And that’s fine, there’s nothing wrong with playing the field, but probably not good for the lead.   I feel like he’s probably a decent person overall but absolutely should not have been the lead. (and that’s all assuming he got past the colorism, sexism, and homophobia he displayed in his pre-show social media)
The issue is you don’t follow the men and production knows things you don’t because they see these guys up close and hear about them. You named men who don’t meet this criteria, namely Rick, Rodney, Aven and Andrew  I don’t know much about joes dating history or Ethan or Quincy to evaluate them but none made it as far as Zach
Disrespectful to Rachel R. how? Because he broke up with her? I’m honestly confused
👏🏼Perfectly said👏🏼  Also. Maybe this will finally change moving forward? I want to have hope.
I’m 26. My husband is 26. We’ve been married since we were 22. 26 is old enough to know what you want and to go for it.
Not to mention he knew before having sex with her that he was going to pick Kaity. Telling “everyone” (but he didn’t tell Ariel?) was all about saving the relationship he actually wanted. He’s actual scum for that.
I don’t understand why everyone acts as if Gabi wasn’t aware of the risk she was taking when deciding to have sex in the FS. This is the Bachelor after all. The last Bachelor season, Clayton’s, made a huge deal about sex in the FS. Gabi had to know that there was the possibility that it would be made public, especially since Zach openly declared the no sex rule.
Who was the last Bach who kept their job? Pilot pete?
Maybe Rachel R can show him how it’s done when she apologizes to Clayton for shading him through her season.
Did I miss her being mentioned on Zach’s season?
I get that. I want representation, too. I was positively surprised that there was representation in this season that I’ve never seen before —being part of an immigrant family.
Jared did?
I’m concerned for you that you think Zach had “bursts of anger.”
Is HB still dating that one guy? If so, she’s been in a solid relationship for a long time shortly after she left
Well that’s the “ready” part. She might’ve been willing, but she seemed nowhere ready to me.
I think you’re right about Tayshia. During her season I really thought she wanted to get married and settle down. And perhaps she did initially, but then she was presented with so many opportunities post-season that I think her time line & wanting 5 kids may have changed!
By his final contestants, he really had amazing taste in women.
There’s no denying that it can be toxic! I just think it’s interesting that this is the one show/franchise that seems to react so strongly and consistently with its fanbase in an overtly negative way (if that makes sense lol)
So what you’re saying is… we’re actually all super self aware?   /s
I think what this really comes down to is that social media has changed the dynamic between viewers and contestants. People no longer quietly have opinions— they express them online!   Instead of producers and ABC execs protecting players from this (by paying them appropriately, offering them independent therapy and guidance as they handle newfound fame, not ruthlessly manipulating them onscreen for ratings, etc), they fan the flames by painting people in a bad light. Then they immediately act like the audience is deeply flawed for reacting to the narratives/storylines they themselves are putting out to the nation.   The audience does not owe contestants or leads anything; they’re allowed to express their opinions on open forums like this. These new social media dynamics may simply be unsustainable!
feather feather!!!!
She named men that don’t meet her criteria because of their edits. I have only seen Rodney and aven with white women in real life and andrew has made his disdain for darker skinned women known  Rick also was putting down gabby on social media in defense of Erich and she thinks that should be lead? Let’s also not forget Rodney and his friends attacking eliza on social media. Aven went after multiple women on Twitter. Not lead material.
Pre-show social media?
You’re probably right.  I’m not actually saying he meets the criteria.  I’m saying he appeared (from bachelor appearances) to meet the criteria.   (Caveat) Whatever happened with Teddi on paradise though was weird and maybe disqualifying, but that seemed more about production than Andrew.  He was a bit of a dip in his relationship with Brittany, but not awful.   Andrew was kind to Katie, is handsome, and has dated women from different backgrounds on the show.  I fully believe you that he is an fboi. I just choose to ignore most of these people’s “real life” because I’m just here for the show.
I’m sure You’re right.  I just offered examples based on what I’ve seen.  I don’t want to follow any of these people.  I’m just saying that their edit was better than Zach’s.  Zach didn’t come across well with the way his arc ended on Rachel’s season. All these men had less problematic arcs on the show than Zach did.   But the reality is that as long as production keeps casting a bunch of duds, we will keep having duds of some sort as the lead.
Yes, because he broke up with her and called her two faced and fake (essentially- don’t remember the words he used).
girl come back in five years lol
Yet Zach explicitly told her that it would stay between them, so why would she then anticipate him broadcasting that info to the cameras and to Kaity? Your comment seems kind of slut-shamey, like just because she consented to having sex does not mean that she consented to having that publicly disclosed, especially when it was done privately. Nick V did the same thing to Andi and he was rightfully flamed for it.
Gabi actually watched Clayton’s season to prep for the show. She was probably just really hate about the fact that Zach didn’t check in with her before telling everyone else. I adore Zach and Kaity but yes, he could have gone about that a different way.
Rachel and Clayton are friendly now so clearly they’re fine. Also what Clayton did to Rachel was exponentially worse than Rachel not being that into Zach.
Amen!
Rachel didn’t shade Clayton, except for N1 if you can even call it that with production interference. Zach shaded Rachel R every single damn fucking episode.   According to your comment history, you also think it’s okay for Zach to publicize his sexcapades and that’s all I really need to know. Boy bye.
He mentioned something about their fantasy suite dates during his own fantasy suite dates. Which is a capital offense, apparently
He mentioned her on every season. I understand people don’t watch very closely, but he shaded her on every episode (whether that was in ITM’s or dates). He also told Ariel about his fantasy date with Rachel which I don’t think was right.
I think they bought a house together recently
Idk when they started dating but it was over a year after her season filmed wasn't it?
I hear ya. I wonder if it’s because this show is mostly made up of “normal” people and not celebrities who get thrust into the public eye. (I don’t watch much other reality TV besides Survivor so not sure about other romance reality stuff)
Andrew’s twitter had a horrific string of homophobic, colorist, and sexist tweets. One of which was essentially “i only date light skinned women”. It should come up if you search the sub for it.   He’s also cousins with Clay Harbour from Becca’s season and seems to agree with Clay often on a lot of his uh… problematic opinions
Lol even my parents got married at 22 and are still married at almost 60.
I don’t think Nick was in the wrong at all. He had a valid point IMO. I think it is unrealistic/naive to have an expectation of privacy on any BN show. Everything and anything can be made public as we have seen time & time again. I think Zach was in the wrong for making a promise he could not keep, but I think it was very reasonable for him to tell Kaity what happened. And I think it was unreasonable for Gabi to expect it to be kept private; that is material info which the other women may or may not want to know.
He did ck in with Gabi before telling Kaity. Remember he surprised Gabi in her hotel room before his Kaity date.
We don’t actually know what happened with Rachel and Zach. And he didn’t really speak ill of her on his season, he alluded to wishing he had known they weren’t “each others person” sooner but the only time he shaded her was on her season after the fantasy suite.
This most ridiculous take I’ve ever seeing on here 😂😂. The fact you actually think what Clayton did to her was worse then her literally fucking bring a dude to Mexico just to dump him is actually fucking nuts 😂.
She talked about him a lot. It wasn’t just night one.
Like it’s completely off topic ya know
Oh please. My husband knows all my business. It’s probably not even a big deal which is why Ariel laughed. It’s probably dumb BS that they keep going for attention since it benefits them mutually.
The first time either of them posted each other looks like February 2021, so about two years after her season filmed.
I shouldn't really be surprised. Wasn't Justin the same as well. They all have that same energy tbh
so talk about them you ain’t got nothing to brag about yet bahahah
Oh yes, I remember that. Now it’s making me wonder what was Gabi so upset about
Whatever you say.
Your “my husband knows all my business” literally doesn’t matter here, Ariel isn’t married to Zach. Wanna try again? 😂
That’s really rude.
Nope. He was my boyfriend too and the point still stands.
Yeah, my point still stands as well. They are not dating so your experience still doesn’t matter at this point.
They were when they had the conversation so it actually does stand.
Ah yes, the dating phase of we’ve spent less than 10 hours together, if that. Glad to know that’s how you see your relationship with your husband, hopefully it doesn’t end up like Zach and Ariel for you.
Lmao it’s the same amount of time he fuckin had will Rachel* so chill tf out lmao. My husband and I are fine, he can run his mouth about me to whoever he wants because it’s also his body and his life and I don’t make my husband shun his feelings to preserve my image.
These are the ones I've noticed. Not sure if I'm missing anyone.   Bachelor  Andy Baldwin - Tessa Horst  Sean Lowe - Catherine Giudici  Bachelorette  Ali Fedowsky - Roberto Martinez  Clare Crawley - Dale Moss  Michelle Young - Nayte Olukoya
Sean Lowe chose Catherine. (Part Filipino) Michelle Young chose Nayte. Clare chose Dale.
There have been several POC F1s:  * Mary (Byron) * Tessa (Andy) * Catherine (Sean) * Roberto (Ali) * Dale (Clare) * Nayte (Michelle) - Michelle was the only lead POC that picked a POC F1.  ETA: Tino (RachelR)
Clare chose Dale
Nayte won Michelle’s season, although they aren’t still a couple.
Dale moss
Off the top of my head  Nayte and Michelle  Clare and Dale  Rachel and Bryan  Sean and Catherine   Ali and Roberto  This is just from Bachelor and Bachelorette there’s a lot more from Bachelor in Paradise
Would Mary count?
Tessa, Dale, Catherine, Nayte, Roberto
Sharleen totally would have on Juan Pablo’s season if she didn’t self-eliminate!
Tessa Horst (half-white and half-Asian) was the first POC on her season to "win" the show.
roberto on ali's season,
Has any "mono-racial" POC won the Bachelor/ette?
Catherine is the first person to come to mind. I think she the only Asian contestant to win as well.
Rachel, Tayshia, Michelle, and Charity “won” 😉
Has a Black woman ever won?
POC leads don't pick POC contestants. Interesting....
I know Rachel Lindsay's husband is also South American (I forgot where from). He has a Spanish background. I know he's white passing though so not sure if that counts.
I think Rachel and Bryan count too. I forget what he identifies as
I think Tino too
I didn’t see earlier seasons with Mary and tessa. So it looks like have never had a black woman win or any POC that was mono racial.
Dale. Dale was great. I miss Dale. I wonder how Dale is doing today? Does anybody know how Dale is? Dale.
Mary Delgado was F1, Tessa Horst in season 10 too.
It wasn’t exactly a win for diversity so people don’t mention it— but isn’t Rachael half-Honduran (through her father)?
Idk if Jojo counts but she is half Persian
Bryan and Roberto aren’t poc.
Yep, Cuban, right?
Mary who?
she definitely "won" that then lol
Tessa Horst was the first  on Andy’s season.  She said she has Chinese and Polish ancestry
I mean, literally none of them but ok.
No. Michelle Young has gotten the furthest placing 2nd
There have only been a few POC leads and Michelle literally picked Nayte
Not trying to cause anything, but I genuinely don't understand why it is wrong for POC to not pick POC. I mean it's like a lot of other things that POC fought for the right to do. Loving v. Virginia literally fought for a black woman and white man to live in Virginia after getting married and the resulting Supreme Court action legalized interracial marriage in all 50 states because certain statues were deemed unconstitutional via the 14th Amendment.   I'll say straight out I'm a white woman so I may just be totally uneducated, but after living in Virginia and reading about the case its just confused me why people see something that was once a civil rights victory as bad. I saw the comments a lot with Matt and Rachel not choosing Black POCs (before things came out about Rachael).
Except Michelle picked Nayte soooo...yes, some do.
Is it interesting? Pretty sure we are in 2023 lmao
I believe Bryan is Colombian
He’s white and from South America (as is Juan Pablo i believe). Race is more complex than we allow it to be most of the time but in south america they would both be considered white hispanic and not POC. Colorism is a huge and complex issue in a lot of cultures and i obviously can’t speak for their personal experiences, but they would generally not be considered POC when in Columbia/Venezuela. People of european Spanish descent are generally not considered POC though, although that doesn’t mean they don’t experience racism in the US.
He's Colombian! Technically, "Spanish" would mean from Spain
I would Bryan to be a POC personally.
I believe he is Colombian!
Bryan and his parents look like White Latinos, but I don’t know if he/they identify otherwise.
IIRC Rachel once talked about production not casting decent POC men for her season. I’m sure it wasn’t meant as a dig to her own husband (if he identifies as white/white Latino) since they did make it down the aisle when most couples don’t. While it’s obviously not a requirement I’ll be interested to see what all of the men on Charity’s season are like and who stands out to her (and to the audience).
I got baked and watched Dale’s lifetime movie a few weeks ago and can report: worse than most 😂
He's in a seemingly happy relationship with a popular interior designer and is doing a lot of charity work. Seems like Dale is doing great.
I posted awhile ago he’s opening a restaurant in nyc as an investor
Oh nice I had no idea about that
I think op is just asking when the lead chose a poc as F1. Jojo was the lead so she doesn’t count here.
Roberto was definitely POC. He's skin was brown/tan
Bryan is Colombian.
But Cubans can be white?
Yes.
Mary Delgado, winner of Byron's season.
Yes people always forget about her!
They’re talking about as Bachelorette
Also, Tayshia might have tied with Hannah Godwin for F2 — he sent them both home around the same time to chase his F1
Thank you for answering! I’ve only been watching since Hannah Brown’s season.
I think she would have been third if serene hadn’t dropped out but….
The criticism isn't towards interracial relationships. I think it's just frustrating to see that most of the contestants, including POC, this show casts only date white people. The issue isn't POC ending up with non-POC. It's that some POC completely write off other POC as romantic prospects, and not just those from their own backgrounds. Looking at the social media of some of the POC contestants people have been pushing to become a lead, for example, their friends are mostly white, the people they date are white/light-skinned. Sometimes there are few POC friends posted on their page at all. As an As Am, I don't understand or agree with that mindset of being exclusive of your own people or other backgrounds. People who do that make sweeping, often internalized, generalizations about race and culture. We don't need that mindset perpetuated on this show. Though, of course, this show's primary audience is white.
richard was 17 when he met 11 year old mildred. im always surprised that people quoting this case always leave out the fact that he was likely fighting for his right to marry his groomed spouse.   the reason it’s looked down upon for POC to marry white people is because more often than not, it’s a product of white supremacy. marrying a white person is a symbol of status. there’s a reason POC have to be 10/10s to compete with the average white person.
he is
He’s not white. Skin color doesn’t matter, a light skinned Latin American  is still Latin American. Are we putting up ranges on what skin colors are considered white vs POC? You can be pale and your sibling be darker while sharing the same parents. Saying that someone that is mexican/South American is white simply because they have a lighter color is kind of hurtful, it minimizes the struggles that they still have to go through.   I’m very light skinned and 100% Mexican and I promise you I still had to deal with my fair share of racism. I learned very quick that even being the lightest skinned Mexican doesn’t make you not Mexican when in a group of white friends. All of the stereotypes are still projected on to you, all of the mean jokes are still said to you. Neither of my parents speak English and i still had to deal with a ton of bullying regarding English being my second language and felt so much fear that people would look down on me. Saying that just because someone is light skinned they’re not POC is not true.   Now if it’s talking about our own cultures yes being lighted skinned is more desired in the Mexican/South American culture but again that doesn’t mean you stop being latino.
I think they meant that his ancestors were from Spain, not indigenous South Americans. The distinction is a huge deal within South American countries.
I said he has a Spanish background because I didn't know which country in South America he's from (like I stated above), I just knew he was from one of the countries in South America where Spanish is the #1 spoken language.
You think so? I don't know what Tessa looks like, but Catherine definitely looks Filipino to me. I could tell Catherine was mixed right away. But I also know a rather surprising amount of people who are Filipino-Italian, like Catherine is, so maybe I just have a trained eye hahaha
I would disagree that Catherine is more white passing than Bryan personally but yes
they prob do identify as white, most Latinos outside the US are pretty black and white about it all anyway.   my dad’s family has white skin and they identify as white. they swore up and down that we are Irish and that I had an Irish great grandparent. took a dna test to see if I could find a relatives or some way to get Irish citizenship and it turns out they report like 3% from Ireland and Scottish. Being from a colonized country is wild. Anyway, there goes my dream retirement
There’s a lifetime movie about Dale?
Oh that’s great. I’m glad to hear that. Sometimes, I just catch myself just putting Dales name into a sentence, randomly.
Oh I see. Then yeah I don’t think I can think of anyone else.
Lol there’s white Columbians just like there are black Columbians. There’s a difference between race and ethnicity
We saw her beautiful family at the hometowns, they were POC. Her dad asked Bob to at least not harm his daughter, and the Bob slept with her and coldly dumped her, reminding me of how classy and beautiful she and her family was, and how much I can't stand Blob.
No, I get it, but they didn’t win.
All good
Most likely
Latin American people can be white. Colombians (like Bryan) can be white, Black, Indigenous, etc. Being from Latin America does not automatically make someone non-white. There's a difference between being light-skinned and still a POC (Zendaya for example), and just being white like Bryan. Could anyone tell Bryan apart from any white European man from Spain?  White Latin-Americans certainly deal with xenophobia, but not racism. Two different kinds of oppression, both of which are valid.
Yes, exactly that's what I meant.
Yeah, your first part was my point - a lot of people use "Spanish" to describe all Latinos when that's just their language and not technically correct. Yes, some have ancestors from Spain but not all. I'm not sure if Bryan has confirmed about his ancestry before.
I think the word you're looking for would be hispanic
Here’s Tessa  http://www.realitytvworld.com/news/the-bachelor-couples-now-whom-did-the-bachelor-stars-and-their-final-bachelorettes-actually-end-up-with-%28photos%29-21287g652m.php
A lifetime romance movie starring dale hahah
It was Byron’s season she won. (Not Bob’s)
Yeah… hence the quotes and wink face
I understand I just take it very personally as someone that is light skinned and at least based on ancestry have European heritage. I don’t consider myself white especially with everything that I’ve been through. Just because someone has some European in their ancestry doesn’t mean they are tied in any significant way to European culture. I may be 30% Spanish but all of my extended family, great grandparents as far my family can remember is all Mexican - born in Mexico, raised in Mexico. So to not be considered a POC even though I was raised as a POC and have had a good amount of racism in my life from this is at least personally hurtful.   From my experience growing up lighted skinned with European heritage in mexico I was still Mexican. I didn’t automatically get money or better opportunities or a better life simply because of my color. It is considered more beautiful but other than that I don’t see how color had any other impact. It’s just like any other physical feature like eye color, hair texture, etc. In my experience color and race plays a much much bigger role in the US than Mexico. If an American moves to Mexico then yes there is a change in how people act towards them because people assume they have money but that is not the same case with someone that is just lighted skinned/European ancestry. As someone who has not grown up in it you can’t really just say a blanket statement that he experienced white privilege when at least in my experience white privilege is very much an American thing.   So again, it’s hurtful as someone who fits the description that you are explaining and has lived in both Mexico and the US to be labeled as white because that’s what some text book or article said we are. It minimizes the struggles we still face.

Oh, I thought it was about Dales life.
She was on Bob's season too, he dumped her after the FS date.
Correct, remember on that last comment when I said I get it? That’s what I meant.
You are wrong. If you don’t know where in south america then use Latino or Hispanic instead of Spanish. Spanish background means from Spain not from Spanish speaking country
It’s a basic courtesy thing, dude. A lot of people from LATAM don’t appreciate being described as the people who colonized them
Ah true
Ohhh, so you were being negative?
[removed]
[removed]
Not negative, just honest. I think the post poses a fair question
No one is arguing if he speaks Spanish. Someone kindly corrected what the correct word to use but you decided to argue about it. And saying “sue me” is really dismissive to people from Latin America who don’t want to be categorized with their colonizers.
You didn’t use the term Spanish-speaking. You said he has a Spanish background. Now you’re trying to rewrite history instead of admitting you were wrong.
I’m confused, how were you being honest? I don’t think that other poster was being insincere with their joke. Do you??
[removed]
No, I was just going back to the question being posed in the post. I’m sorry if I offended you.
Eating overnight oats and they make me sad. I do not love them. But I have high cholesterol and need the fiber and protein 😮‍💨
Found out a couple weeks ago that my dad has a rare and aggressive form of cancer that has a low survival rate. He had a second surgery yesterday and starts radiation soon.  On the way out of the hospital from being discharged, a nurse told him and my mom, "well we can still hope for a miracle…" in a somber tone. Just felt like a rude/unnecessary comment and squashed any hope I had that he could beat this.
I put a box in the gap in my fence where my dog keeps escaping from until my boyfriend gets back from vacation and can fix it and every time he went out this morning, he ran right to the spot where he escaped and was so confused and upset that he couldn’t break out 🤪
Earlier this week I posted about striving for grade level team lead over department chair (the one I was more likely to be offered) primarily because I was worried one of my toxic coworkers would get it.   Today after sitting in on an interview, I found out the "ringleader" is leaving, and my principal officially offered me department chair!   So I took a leap of faith and accepted. :)
Maybe I’m not as bad at small talk as I think I am and everyone around me just kinda sucks instead.
Cole Sprouse's camera duels account is so weird. I guess I had followed it a while ago and forgot, then saw that post (second most recent) where he brutally made fun of the 2 women and I was shook. Now he's doubling down on it and basically making fun of everyone who disliked it. Weird petty behavior
THE PHILLIES ARE ON THE BOARD

Hang in there! I just started eating overnight oats regularly again, since I have braces for the first time (adult). It’s okay to add some sugar and things you enjoy to make it more palatable! I’ve been enjoying a peanut butter overnight oats and an apple cinnamon overnight oats this week.
There are some really yummy recipes for overnight oats! But it obviously depends on just how healthy you want them to be 😜
I make overnight oats but pop it in the microwave for 1-2 minutes before eating. Feels less horse-food like then.
Did you use chia seeds? I like oats generally but I haaaate the recipes that use chia seeds. They make the oats too gelatinous for me. If you also hate that, you could try the recipes without!
Wishing you and your family any form of peace you can find in this dark time. Ask him to write down anything you may want to read later. There’s something about holding onto something they wrote that you can’t get with a photo or video. ♥️
I love your username. 😁
I might try making my own. I use those prepackaged kinds. And they are kind of bitter?
It just doesn’t compare to an egg and bacon bagel sandwich 🥲 would love your fave recipes if you got them handy
I eat the overnight oats that come in a package in several flavors. They do have chia but I swallow it up for the fiber perks lol
I make my own. Not bitter at all. I would be happy to share some recipes if you like!
Ugh agreed. Few things are as delicious as a good bacon egg and cheese.  Dude Diet is probably my favorite cooking lady. Here's her version of [pumpkin spice oats](https://domesticate-me.com/best-vegan-pumpkin-spice-latte-overnight-oats/) and [peanut butter banana vegan oats](https://domesticate-me.com/vegan-peanut-butter-and-banana-overnight-oats/).

If anyone is interested, I can explain a bit about climate models and how we're analyzing the climate.  Climate models are done through global climate models (GCMs), and they exist on grid spaces of roughly 100km by a 100km. Analyzing the climate requires a global climate model first because wind and ocean currents are constantly circulating to different parts of the world, and create an interconnected system. Once a GCM is first established on a global scale, the latitude, longitude and other variables are manipulated to focus on different areas.  The drawback to this is that such a large grid size makes it so that we can't capture smaller climate details in our projections. Clouds are something we can't capture in climate models because they're much smaller than our grid spaces and this can cause a lot of uncertainty in the models. Making the grid sizes smaller is not possible with our current computational technology. A lot of my science research/work is focused on parameterizing these smaller climate effects so they're more accurate.  This is why the latest IPCC report stated that things were a bit worse than expected, because the uncertainty wasn't fully captured:  [https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/20/world/ipcc-synthesis-report-climate-intl/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/20/world/ipcc-synthesis-report-climate-intl/index.html)  However uncertainty can go the other way too. We can also hit a best case scenario. I don't think things are hopeless and we are still very much in the window of time to reverse climate change effects, especially since renewable technology is vastly improving. It will be a big push on the policy front to change things, but I do think it's possible.
Since the whole Ariel article came out there’s been a lot of talk about anti Zionism being the same thing as anti semitism. I hope everyone that blindly supports the existence of an apartheid state has caught up on the news about what’s happening is Al Aqsa right now and what happens to Palestinians Avery single Ramadan. https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/4/5/israeli-police-attack-worshippers-in-jerusalems-al-aqsa-mosque
Using this thread to note that the baby clothing company SaintHaven Saint Haven being promoted by Vanessa Grimaldi (Nick Viall’s ex F1) is owned/founded by Jacqueline Sacks, wife to David Sacks. Big entitled trump fans and tech billionaire besties with Elon Musk.
I gotta say, it's a little uncomfortable to me that you explicitly raised antisemitism as some sort of a "gotcha." I think it's absolutely horrible what's happening right now at Al-Aqsa and it's worth talking about, but if your goal is encourage people to catch up on this news, you could have just done that without your first sentence.  This sub already does have a pretty bad antisemitism problem, so pitting people against each other by saying "HEY LOOK OVER HERE, THIS **ISN'T** ANTISEMITISM" comes across really poorly to me.
Thank you for the Reddit cares 💀!

If Charity's FIR is still there, this next week is one to look out for. Week 5 is usually a big week for FIRs who are actual contenders to get their first 1-1's. ~~Tino~~, Nayte, Garrett, Bryan, Shawn, & Jordan all got theirs week 5. Luke P (another FIR though he wasn't F1) also got his week 5.
Manifested us getting a pic/video yesterday and we got one! So I’m going to do it again especially since it’s the very important episode five coming up! Also finally finding out who got the FIR would be great too!  ![gif](giphy|Cy8dxpgcMHD5ILVHO0)
I want to know who Charity's FIR is, I hope it's not another predictable season where knowing who the FIR is means we know who the F1 is ...unless it's one of the guys I'm rooting for lol.
Caleb B is down a post on insta so I think he’s out. Not that him being out is surprising lol.
I think John b mighttt be out. He just saw my story I posted of him.
Once we figure out who got the FIR I'm predicting him as F1 and calling it a day 😌. I will just be pleasantly surprised if he doesn't turn out to be F1.  Edit: I should also say I'd be happy if the FIR doesn't turn out to be F1, I've been wanting them to change that pattern forever, and it's only happened sporadically over the years.
According to a source who was at the Barbie group date, after Tanner performed for charity, Jordan and Jojo encouraged him to kiss her post performance in front of everyone.  I do not believe Jordan would have done that to someone that Charity isn’t vibing with, so he seems to be another front runner
https://preview.redd.it/1q32t8pxn4sa1.jpeg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a809df8a66d4bdbb968fc750607f055e4dca0609  If you look closely, looks like Joey def got a rose this week before RC 4. He could’ve gotten another one-on-one date or Charity gave him a group date rose 🌹. I can smell potential F1/F2 from a very far distance without even the season being done filming yet 👃
https://preview.redd.it/rhnwwzls68sa1.jpeg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b946b5b7943e3fc6c470706721cb998c02f36646  Good night everyone, good detective work today! 🫶
The most important question: Is Warwick still there? 🥹
Warwick is incredibly handsome but wen I saw this I was like nope lol hes also on the list of whoever laughed at Spencer , but I'm guessing only Joey and Michael are remaining from that date   https://preview.redd.it/lstpyuhi76sa1.jpeg?width=518&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1d8675b946fe6e4b3484063cea80f0c13d7964eb
Do we have any idea who got the FIR?
I expect nothing else from someone who claims to be Aaron’s best friend lol
I find it hilarious that Aaron C was the king of Here for the Right Reasons crew, and literally fought and threw tantrums to prove his point and get 3 people eliminated on his season.
This doesn't look good, but this brings up more questions and I hope we get more information.   Was it casual or a situationship? Were they exclusive and had that discussion? Were they boyfriend and girlfriend and planning a future together?   What's the photographic proof? Was it that they were together and/or exclusive, or that he couldn't discuss it (possibly because of a NDA)?
Lols I don’t see him being a top contender. We’ll see when the show airs but I feel like people were just projecting their wants onto Charity. Not saying others don’t have similar news surrounding them but I hope Aaron “my BFF is dude bro Aaron Clancy” B is out within the next couple of days. Good riddance
How is this bad news? All of these guys now come on for exposure. The show knows he is friends with Aaron. They were looking at Brandon’s brother too but he didn’t make the cut
Thank god! lol
Wait, I had just changed him to my new F1 😭
![gif](giphy|EWGVEOwZIk8yA)
Well damn. I feel like we should’ve seen this coming since it seems like he got the “joke” outfit on the Barbie date. I just didn’t expect him to be sent home so soon? Oh well. I wonder who stayed over him
His numbers started changing after week three so that might’ve been when he got eliminated.
Well there’s that John B as potential frontrunner down the drain 💀😭 and any potential first Asian maleFIR, Bachelor, F1 down the drain as well.
I feel like this is going to be another FIR is F1 season too
Lol yup that’s the best way to go about it haha.
Unless Charity is a Gabby and Tayshia and all the other “Bachelor” leads 😜 I don’t count Hannah B because I really think if Luke P actually behaved well as others, he might’ve been F1.
But ever since Tayshia, the bachelorettes FIR have not been F1, (well the FIR charm came back for Michelle and Rachel), so even if we know who the FIR is, we don't know if they're 100% F1 like it was before.  Edit:  Let me rephrase my statement; ever since Tayshia, I feel like we have been getting bachelorettes who have not chosen their FIR as their F1 and I feel like that eill continue in future seasons, so knowing Charity's f1 is not completely a sealed deal like it would be before Clayshia's season.
I think he's definitely in the f3 potentially f2. I hope we find out who gets the next 1-on-1 bc they could be the f1 as well.
what do we know of joey? is he a good guy?
Yea he’s definitely a front runner, just depends who got FIR since we know he didn’t
Hehehe I predicted Joey would be a finalist right after they dropped the cast pictures just based off his look, long before that kissing group date happened. Then I moved him up to F1 after that group date win…  ![gif](giphy|jNI5MLHJT1imATj4LM)
I thought he was likely eliminated after RC 2 since his IG following number jumped by a lot
Who if u don't mind sharing👀
I mean many of these people want to be on reality tv. Charity did! Her friends were sources for Reality Steve. She’s deep into the fandom.
At least it’s not messed up racist homophobic sexist tweets we’ve seen in the past. We don’t know for sure if he was the one who laughed, just because he might’ve been sent home along with Josh and John Henry. And it could’ve still been Joey and Michael even if they’re still there. Remember Gabby made a joke about it too. I already knew about this tweet. That’s the only tweet that I know people would call it eventually to find something to criticize, but most of his tweets are very wholesome.
Isn't this tweet saying that he wants to get "into" reality TV, like he wants to watch more reality TV? If he wanted to get on a show, wouldn't he say "I gotta find a way to get onto reality TV"? Or, am I giving the contestants' grammar and composition skills too much credit? lol
![gif](giphy|uZropXpErKqHK)  Lol fartbox blocked me
No, not yet unfortunately.
Same! This is not shocking
Friends/family members of past contestants always do very well on the show. Tia from Raven, Hannah Ann from Hannah G, Andrew from Clayton, etc. so I won’t be surprised if Aaron B becomes a frontrunner or make it very far with coaching from Aaron C.
TPTB throwing Hunter and Thomas under the bus when the real villain was right there will never not irk me lol.
A lot of past F1s have this similar issue behind them back home. So just based off how frequent this happens every Bachelorette season, he’s a top contender in my eyes now 🤣🤣🤣
I expect everyone to come on for exposure, but I’m side eying everyone who comes on with a significant other.
Ooh my bad. I thought Tino was week 5. I corrected my post.
This is the perfect GIF response 😂
Knowing how predictable it’s already looking I think it’s a high likely chance.
Haha and I still think Gabby only picked Mario because Erich was flirting with both women night one and his ego needed to be put in check. I still can’t get over the awkward Gabby/Mario kiss lol
Tino was just last season.
These are the only 3 men Joey, Sean, and Aaron B caught on camera by bystanders yesterday (they also got 1-on-1/won group dates already). I wonder how well some of the potential frontrunners are doing. John B where you at!
The ppl that knew him in the Facebook comments of his pic had high praise
I just did a mini deep dive on his LinkedIn lol — I think he’s gorgeous. He’s a tennis player / former tennis instructor, now head of activities at a country club in Hawaii? He is originally from PA, was in Fellowship of Christian Athletes in HS so he may still be Christian - not sure about his politics. He was president of his Frat in college.  No clue if he’s a good dude or not but I’m sure he knows he’s hot and has no problem getting girls, but I don’t think I care 🙈
Don’t think Sean is a frontrunner but I do think Joey for sure and Aaron B possibly as well. Add in mysterious FIR, and maybe some other sleuthed potential frontrunners like John B and Michael. We might have gotten this season figured out! Usually it’s very predictable. They are in thick mid season filming now.
How much did it jump by? I know there was one time his following went down by 3 but then a few days later he was on a group date. Idk my following jumps up and down by 3-4 ppl almost every week. Unless his number of posts changed like Caleb B, I feel like I can’t depend on followings and followers.
I think charity would rather have a relationship/husband than be on TV regardless of being a fan. How do u kno her friends were sources for reality steve?
wait sorry I know this is beside the point, but are John Henry and Josh confirmed out? I was excited about both of them (based purely on vibes) :(
I know we dont kno that why I said hes on the list of potential suspects lol. he seems nice and funny and ppl who know him on facebook comments said too, I just have the sense hes not really ready and looking for a serious relationship that charity wants so I sensed he wouldnt go far. about the group date in general i dont think that charity would like someone laughing at another's distress
Holy shit you’re freaking right! Then correct grammar should’ve been “I want to get on reality TV” not “into reality TV” if that’s how we were all interpreting it!
Aaron was a producer pet.
Hell even Karl was in a year+ long relationship until just recently
There was also Cody that he threw under the bus as well.
She just days they were dating. All of these men were dating women when they joined the show. She doesn’t say we were in a relationship or he was my bf
Worst kiss in Bachelor history!  ![gif](giphy|k2A4gzRxDL4GI)
And he was such a dick about it, i disliked him from there and it only got worse
This is true, and also Michelle, but Tayshia, Katie, and Gabby FIR were different than their F1's and I think were gonna start seeing more of that in future seasons.  Let me edit my original post tho 😭.
Didn’t Brayden have a 1 on 1 as well.
With Joey just being a big member of some sort of Christian-related club seals the deal as to why he’s doing really well with Charity 👍 I feel like Charity is def going to pick someone very close to her Christian faith at the end of this.   Edit: out of all potential frontrunners so far, I just realized John B. has a holy cross on his IG bio. Gonna see if the other potential front runners have something Christian faith related as well.  Edit: Just found out another sleuthed potential frontrunner Tanner’s background is very Christian. Mother’s fb has a lot of Bible verses and holy cross pics.   Edit: Another sleuthed potential frontrunner, Michael, has a Bible verse as his IG bio.   If they all continue to be frontrunners, it’s going to be a very Christian faith-based love story, y’all.
Oh gosh, I think FCA was what Jordan Rodgers was in.. I hope Joey was more open-minded/moved on from that!
thank you!! you’re the best!
His followers went up by 10 and his following 11.
Hugs for you, friend.
Because they bragged about it online and were silly enough to kept their profiles public.
I’m so curious to know if John Henry is still there. I thought he’d go far but he hasn’t been seen in a while. He also hasn’t had a lot of movement on SM so he could still be there.
Josh and Spencer are confirmed out for sure based off sources. As for Warwick and John Henry, it’s all based off either not seeing them anymore these past two weeks and following counts. Yea I typed “he might’ve been eliminated”.
If that’s the case, then Charity should feel same way to Gabby too for starting a joke about it, and then one of the men laughed after moments of awkward silence. For some reason, Spencer still got sent home. So maybe the occasion didn’t really bother Charity to the extent that it bothered the witness who reported it to Reddit. Let’s see how it plays out or how they edit it.
Maybe it’s just me, but if someone says they’ve been dating 5 months I assume it’s more than most casual hookups. 5 months is a decent amount of time. Not very nice of him to do that to her and she’s valid for feeling hurt by it.
Clearly she found it hurtful that he applied for the show while they were seeing each other. It doesn’t make him an evil person, but I don’t think you can decide for her whether it’s valid for her to feel disrespected.
While I agree that coming on for clout or with a close in past relationship isn’t uncommon, having to defend someone this much this early on almost never leads to anything good…The men who have women willing to so quickly expose them usually…never come out looking good.  Because there are many people who have relationships close to when they leave but they leave those relationships in a way that doesn’t put their standing in jeopardy. Aaron B clearly didn’t do that. Just like Aaron C, DeMario, Jed, Nate, etc. don’t want that drama for Charity. Especially when we don’t even know if she’s that into him.
Naw. That would be Connor Catman and Katie.  ![gif](giphy|xSMCpjzmB1bdN2WW3q|downsized)
You could also look at it as Katie's F1 wasn't there to have the opportunity to receive the FIR.
Yes he did. But some of us feel that Brayden and Charity’s chemistry didn’t look as strong enough to be front runner status based on videos that came out from their date. But people can have diff POVs of it.
If this is the case, I don’t mind as long as the next Bachelor is a MOC. I think Joey seems to be the bachelor pick and I would rather not want a white man chosen again if the F4 includes MOC.
Same - but it was in HS and I know a ton of people who were in the club just because everyone else on the team was. So I think jury is still out on what he believes currently!
I need to do some magic to see how he could still be there. I refuse to accept this harsh reality 😰  ![gif](giphy|JIX9t2j0ZTN9S|downsized)
So ur saying they gave reality Steve spoilers about charity/zachs season which they would have gotten from charity?
thank you!!
I mean who says charity even likes gabby lol but yea who knows what they're even gonna show, I kno they enjoy showing ppl cry so I figured they would focus on that but theyll prob just cut it since it was awkward.
I agree but that’s what men are doing today. If she wasn’t his gf and she accepted that then there is nothing to discuss. He can pursue the bachelorette or any other woman. I don’t know why women keep themselves in these situations
I don't think the commenter is saying it's invalid for her to feel disrespected, just pointing out exclusivity/commitment may not have been confirmed by both parties.
She can feel that way. But other men have done this and some are considered golden boys. Rodney left a woman he was seeing for months for BIP and went back to her; it was posted about on Reddit multiple times; and he still never lost his golden boy status. We can’t pick and choose when it’s ok to leave a girl behind.
She won’t be picking him so I don’t see the big deal. He’s only there because of his friendship with Aaron
You could also look at it as Katie's FIR self eliminated & that's why he wasn't F1 🤷🏾.
I did think about this, at the same time I donfeel like Katie's feelings for Greg were stronger than her feelings for Blake, so she would have always given her FIR to Greg imo.
Yea but again I thought Joey lost front runner status when she didn’t acknowledge him on the Barbie date, so I guess it really could just be the wrong 5 sec clip to look at haha
I would prefer MOC bachelor too. I can care less if they are very Christian or not, because very likely the top contenders who make it far with Charity will be very Christian.
No they’ve been fans for years. They bragged about giving him spoilers for Hannah’s season although I’m sure they also gave him spoilers for Zach’s season.
I really hope both are still there! I’m trying to work my magic haha! But there’s a chance unfortunately that Warwick is out based on following/follows counts movements of 10 users :/
As of right now, I don’t think we should make an assumption about a guy for based off his one tweet from 4 years ago (that doesn’t harm any group of people whatsoever) that he was the one who laughed at Gabby’s joke toward someone who is in distress, when the witnesses themselves haven’t even revealed who it actually was. We have to be extra careful in who we point fingers to especially when we don’t know the context behind it. Whatever happened it def got Spencer eliminated as well. Also, plenty of respectable leads and successful contestants have revealed they went on for the reality TV experience and that it’s better to have that perception going in to be pleasantly surprised that you actually end up falling in love with someone.
I think most people just don’t know about the Rodney situation. People who knew definitely consider it to be uncool.
Either way, I don't count it the same way as when Gabby or HB didn't choose their FIR recipients 😂. But others may.
I mentioned in a comment a few days ago that at first I thought he did look like his no longer a frontrunner but then people who attended the date said that they could see their romantic connection, so I’m like well I guess she was just feeling John B a bit more on that particular video than Joey.  Edit: now that someone had mentioned it maybe Joey is either F2-F4 but not F1, if she was favoring someone else over him even while he was right next to her.
I think people have to remember we’re not really seeing the Spencer situation in any context. Maybe he was a weird dude outside of this idk lol. I think it’s weird to already villainize Gabby or the guy that laughed when who knows… maybe it’ll come across really weird to other guys, charity or even viewers too 🤷🏼‍♀️ we’ll have to see how it plays out he obviously got eliminated for some reason
I'm not doing any of that I just pointed out a tweet that made me think he wasnt a serious contender and that theres a possiblity he laughed, all of which would lead to him already being eliminated, it's not that deep
I mean it was on Reddit even while bip was filming and people on Reddit continued to ignore and some made excuses while berating eliza for not being in a fake bachelor couple with him
Exactly! Like there’s more to the context than what is being told by one witness.
Kat from Zach’s season is on Courtney Robertsons podcast “off contact” today, but she’s still very much on contract I’m sure? About to listen but this is confusing.
Cassie was on Taylor Lautner and Taylor Lautner’s podcast. Said she wishes she listened to her initial gut instinct
I saw this question on Ask Reddit and immediately got horrified at the thought of BIP producers mining this for ideas for this summer's gross food dates 🤢  https://preview.redd.it/yupple5jt4sa1.png?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5b08e49096c2453b3307a77adb84c426e835fe7a
I came across the Yosef/Clare argument and Yosef defending himself at the MTA on YouTube.  Looking at the top comments. Did the MRAs and incels invade or something? Because sheesh the top comments on both videos are mostly supporting him and calling the other guys "simps" for calling out a "real man" like Yosef. It's wild.
I wonder if Bachelor Happy Hour is taking a break until the new season starts? There doesn’t seem to be a new episode this week.   Also, I know Becca isn’t the greatest podcaster but I have to give her credit for actually showing up. Michelle wasn’t on last week’s episode with Kaity and Zach. Feels like an episode she should have been there for. Especially since she has been sharing other podcasts she has been on.
Where did Hannah brown move to?
Is this referring to when she left and then the jump fence happened and she was back in? The pressure she must’ve felt and then everything that happened.
That's odd. I feel like there's still plenty to talk about. I would like to hear from other women on Zach's season that they haven't talked to so far. It's interesting to hear their perspective now that the final couple is revealed such as when they knew Kaity was a major frontrunner, etc.
It’s really strange. I wouldn’t be surprised if they took an off-season hiatus but they should’ve at least announced it? Re: Michelle, her constantly missing but sharing other podcasts is just really off…  she doesn’t seem very reliable 😬
I reaaaalllly think both Becca and Michelle should be replaced as hosts, it just isn’t their strong suit.
The podcast is really bad, because Becca and Michelle aren’t good. You know it’s bad when Ben and Ashley I are better. I haven’t listened to Becca or Michelle in a long time so maybe there’s been an improvement, but they’re boring and don’t know how to manage conversations. Since Rachel left you can tell how low quality it is.
I wonder if there will be a new episode of Clickbait tomorrow
Good. Honestly I thought Michelle had more interesting things to say than Becca when she showed up. Becca is a bad host. She’s like Joe. The whole franchise needs a revamp and it can start by pushing certain folks out. I don’t even like most of these people but if they can pay kaitlyn and Nick to be official hosts, Hannah B, Rachel L, hell Andi, keep Ashley and Ben, and get Catherine Lowe maybe pair her with Michelle, and a recent big personality like Aaron maybe pair him with Tahzjuan since they keep using her to talk about this show (Mike and Bryan were a bore) they should. They need personalities who will speak their honest opinions and ask real questions and really promote this show. They need to cut the checks! Cut one to Tyler too to be Bach in the next two years!
I would guess that they planned to talk about Bachelor Live but now that it’s canceled they just decided to take a break. And now they can avoid even mentioning Bachelor Live is canceled. But I can’t believe they didn’t even make an announcement that the shows were canceled. So rude to the fans. It seems like all they did was email people who had purchased tickets through Ticketmaster. Hopefully no one missed the email or was gifted tickets or bought from a third party.
Nashville TN
Yes, it’s the last question in her intv
Lol I missed that it got canceled! I thought it was weird they were trying to do it again after the less than stellar reviews last year.
I really doubt that’s the reason they’re not podcasting this week… literally no one bought tickets so it’s not a huge deal, and the “talent” has no say in how these things are dealt with.
It sucks. She didn’t want to get engaged or be with him. And then he still went to her, and she felt pressure from then on. Post show, I remember she also got pressure from people. Then when the break up happened she continued to get hate and pressure for not being with him. People thought he was the perfect boyfriend, little did everyone know.
Last year they did an episode about Bachelor Live right before it started so I’m sure they had penciled it in. And I mean Becca or Andrew or Rodney could very easily post a story on instagram and let people know it’s canceled.
Yeah I guess they could post something — this franchise is so unserious they put 0 effort into marketing this thing, I don’t think anyone is too upset about the cancellation 😅
She really does look like a Barbie doll!
some of you don't live on the internet with an average of 9 hours of daily phone screen time and it shows!!!
She literally looks like a Barbie. I love it.
y'all are being SO annoying in these comments omg  charity looks awesome and this is campy and cute! can't wait for the real promos to come out 😌
Love it! Can't wait for this movie to finally come out.
They do a Barbie trying to find her Ken competition with the guys, my aunt got some pictures of it last week 🤩
Lol she does remind me of a Barbie. This is fitting for her and pretty cute!
this sub is showing its age again 😂
Love it! She really looks like a real life Barbie.
awwwww how adorable 💕💕💕🤎🤎🤎🤎🤎🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼
Finally a promo relevant to current pop culture! 👏  Also I know this isn’t the official promo but it’s still cute.
Oooh I have those earrings! TJ. Maxx for the win
She is a true Barbie, so I love this 🥰
She’s so pretty 😍
I have always said she reminds me of a real life Barbie 💕
If this is the bachelor without Fleiss, my hopes have already skyrocketed. Show runners, I’m begging you, please bring this show into 2023 and give us modern, fun romance. Be a Greta Gerwig in a world full of Mike Fleiss.
She really is Barbie fr though lol her hair and fits are always that vibe
This is adorable and so perfect for her!
It's cross promotion!! Smart.
When I saw this look I was SCREAMING!!! She looked like a literal angel. She is an angel.
I literally said she looked like a Barbie night one.
I'm a barbie girl, in a barbie world...I miss being young and having gem's like Aqua's barbie girl on the radio... she looks great as always.
My bad, guys. I didn’t realize promo was such a sacred word here 🤧
Y’all this is a template anyone can use on the barbie movie website. This wasn’t specifically made for her lol. The Bachelorette social media person just uploaded the picture and what they wanted the text to say and then it auto generated it. It’s not that serious.  Edit: punctuation
This is the best! She is so adorable! Can’t wait
She looks like a literal Barbie😍
When does her season start?
I wanna know who edited this because they did not understand the assignment... The picture of Charity should be quite a bit smaller lol
What in the graphic design is my passion is this
This is a real promo??  Edit. I am seeing these around so I’m assuming it’s a meme thing?
I like the idea, but I hate this. She’s so gorgeous and lovable, but this is not doing her justice.
This is cute but I really hope this isn’t her actual promo cause she deserves so much more 😭
the concept is cute but this graphic design is atrocious
I assume this is just a fan thing since Barbie is def a registered trademark?  Edit lol never mind I saw the second photo first. I'm surprised
They couldn’t take a new photo of her?
She’s annoying
She looks more like a Bratz doll to me
For real I always assume that my Internet knowledge is the default amount like of course we all saw all the new Barbie content and memes that dropped one day ago
Can you post them??
Girl, post them! Let’s get that exclusive!!
Which website? I've been trying to hunt it down I love this so much!
June I believe
It’s literally a template on the barbie movie website that anyone can use, you just upload a picture.
It looks like the new Barbie movie posters that are going viral.
I think this is just a tweet and some cross-promo with the Barbie movie. I don’t think her official promo has come out yet.
It's also because they are partnering with Barbie the movie. It was leaked that they had a Barbie and Kens date somewhere. (Video) The Bachelor/Bachelorette always promotes something, like how they did the G-force ride to promote Top Gun
I agree. She does have that look and Barbie is technically a cool character with tons of extremely impressive accomplishments and careers, etc, but bffr, "Barbie" is a denigrating thing to call a woman you think is shallow and of below-average intelligence. Even this comparison is solely about her looks. We can do better.
It definitely isn’t lol. They’re just jumping on the Barbie edit trend that started once the trailer for the movie came out.
It's mimicking the graphic design of the Barbie movie ads which I'm assuming are supposed to be really cheesy and feel like Barbie packaging.
What did she do?
Why are you hating?
Why?
Just made a post… not sure if I can add more than one video 🤔
https://www.barbieselfie.ai/step/1-upload/
Girl, if you looked at the actual movie's promotional posters you'd see they were edited waayyy better than this was. Charity's body is way too big for the circle. In the Barbie movie posters, the bodies are more proportionately sized to the circles. I'm just saying the proportions are looking off!
Yeah- they released an app or filter or something (I don’t do any of those) that anyone can make a Barbie poster of themselves
Yep lots of Barbie buzz lately so I figured.
Or the warrior games when Brave came out. Thought that was cute.
Have you seen the Barbie ads that came out yesterday? This is a template that everyone is doing right now, they didn’t randomly decide to call her a barbie
i understood that, that's obvious lol. it's not that it's cheesy, it's just not well done. the concept is clear.
She just annoys me lol
that’s what i’m saying though lol. It’s template you upload the picture to on the website and it automatically makes it and you can’t adjust the proportions. I did it yesterday and my picture ended up looking too small. People are acting like this was professionally made but it’s literally just a template so obviously the proportions are going to be off because it wasn’t specifically made for her and you can’t adjust the proportions.
She's been getting called Black Barbie in here for months, actually, they're responding to fans.
Or it’s completely unrelated, since they are hopping on a trend? I have had at least ten people post their own version of this in the past 24 hours. There’s a site that generates these templates for you. It’s a trend.   Not to mention the official Barbie movie promo photos feature “Barbies” of all colors, body types, and professions?? Literally proving that anyone can be a barbie?
Zach and Kaity would have gotten an invisible edit if they were a BIP couple and I mean that as a compliment.  I could see them being one of the happily “boring” couples who last because they’re focused on each other and the life they’re building together.
Zach was “meh” for me on his own but I love him with Kaity. She makes him so much more. Looove Kaity!
I really hope their relationship lasts. They seem really cute together and I’d like to see a success story.
How on earth has she gotten so much footage in so little time?!
That honeymoon phase… 🥰
This is cute!  I wish during the finale, they showed things like this. They have shown happy collage videos of couples that don't make it (Becca &Arie, Hannah&Jed). I wish they did that for the couples that are happy as well.
Oo I hope this is a bachelor success story! I just really like Kaity and Zach is growing on me. 😆
the canadian boxers...LMAO. 🍁
I see Clayton and Susie comparison but did they even like each other? Kaity and Zach actually seem natural and genuine, but that’s just my take.
These two are cute idk. He's clearly obsessed with her. I see them lasting.
Not enough choking and bathroom pics
I hope they work out. The good thing is they literally both live in Austin so they can’t say “distance was too hard on the relationship”
They really do make a cute couple though.
Kaity makes Zach better.
They seem evenly matched for each other
They seem like a great fit, honestly. Kaity is also so precious and charming
Let's hope these kids can make it work. I'm rooting for them.
Oh my gosh! They look so good together. I feel like I really see the love between the two of them🥺. I really hope this works out.
They compliment each other!
He does not want to stop kissing her lol cute I love their vibes, and Ive seen zero of the usual slight awkwardness of other couples at this point lol
They’re adorable! Would it kill TPTB to show us more cute, lighthearted, silly moments like these on the show 😭
Kaity is legit one of the most beautiful contestants I’ve ever seen. Like doesn’t have the typical “model” face but she’s just so gorgeous
They're going the distance.
I really like them a lot, something really pure about them even if people don’t find them the most interesting.
I totally forgot about them, hopefully that's a good sign they last 💪🏻
The one shot of him braiding her hair 🥺
I have a feeling these two might actually make it
Is it reminding anyone else of that Clayton/Susie Happy Couple TikTok where she was choking him in one frame?  Just me? Got it.
I hope they make it!
I don’t feel like we got a lot of Kaity’s personality on the show, but vids like this show me a little bit more. Happy for these two!!
how do people have so many videos of their significant others and friends? i have zero
ugh I hope they last!
This is super cute!!! I hope they thrive!
I actually love them lol
I was not a huge fan of Zach this season, but dang this actually is really cute
I don’t watch the Bachelor much anymore but I like this couple.
Gosh they're so cute 🥹
(cue Madison sobbing at the gritty.)  Honestly I like them together. Sue me lol
she’s everything, he’s just Ken
Best of luck to them after the honeymoon period. That can be tricky to navigate normally, let alone when your relationship is as hyper-public as this one.
This makes me happy, I had seen a rumor going around that they split and he got with Jessie (the girl he didn't give a one on one too) and it really bummed me out. I've been rooting for Kaity and Zack the entire season. I really hope they can make it work, and last until the end of time! ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|heart_eyes)
They’re cute together
They’re so cute
I really hope they make it... and that says a lot
I haven't liked any BN couple this much together in a long time. Feels good to actually get a love story.
They’re so cute!!! One of my all time favorite BN couples. Say what you want about Zach’s season but he really brought the show back to its heart which is truly finding romance that lasts.
i’m not happy with the way he handled his season and treated Gabi, but they do seem like a compatible couple. I hope they last
They’re so cute!!! 😍😍
Rooting for these cuties
This couple’s sum is greater than it’s parts in my mind, I’m hoping the best for them.
I didn't watch this season so sorry if this has been said a lot, but she looks so much like that blonde girl from Glee.
You can tell he really loves the chica 🥴
Ahh. This flawless sweet video is helping my Zac and Tayshia breakup grief. From one Z to another Z.  ![gif](giphy|Qn9NzcEbZzaVBfT3mS|downsized)
I’m here for it!
i didn’t watch this season but this is adorable
Susie did something similar with Clayton after their season, so the producers ask them to do this or they come up with it on their own?
They are incredibly boring and I wish them a lovely life together.
Awww I love it!
i love them, but i hate these. it's giving clayton and susie
They def banged in the museum
I really want to make a spoof video of “new bachelor couple showing we love each other”
Love it ❤️❤️
I like her, can’t stand him.  I wish them luck though
still think she's too good for him. meh.
And I see these I always picture the camera being set up before these moments happen and it’s sad.
Six months tops.
I think she is so wonderful but I just can’t ship them. I think Gabi won this season
I never have many comments for these because me and my husband suck at getting cute lil videos. But I do want to know why they always use an obscure song for them lol.
They look cute together in the same way that Clayton and Susie looked cute together. I think kaitylanepr is working the PR angles very well so far, just like Susie did.  I predict a breakup in 6 months.
The TikTok is cute but I’ll be honest in that I think it’s weird that they fulfilled their press obligations and then immediately went to different parts of the country. They didn’t even spend their first public weekend together.
Kaity’s doppelgänger is Amber Heard💚💜
I give it a year
Happy for them but that neck kiss and his face while doing it gave me seeeerious ick
Awww two pieces of white bread walking around the world lol borrrriiiinnnggg
Wow if this is their sizzle reel imagine how boring their day to day life is? Eesh.
Get jobs.
She must be really bored to make this and put it out there
 I like her, but I don’t like that she and Susie both made a point of putting a shirtless in bed clip into their “look how much we love each other” montage. There were rejected women on both seasons who felt they were mistreated on the show relating to sex with the bachelor, so let’s just not rub it in their faces?
[removed]
They remind me of Kevin and Astrid on BIP, staying under the radar from cameras, but quietly building a relationship and setting foundations for the future in a real way.  Astrid and Kevin are one of my fave couples in BN, so I'd love to see Zach and Kaity follow a similar path down the line.
idk if you listen to claire and emma’s podcast, but throughout the season they would always say that zach and kaity could have just met on hinge and it’s so accurate.
It could be that app One Second a Day - my sister uses it and it creates videos like this that make it seem like she’s doing way more than she really is!
Since they both live in Austin, they prob were together more often than the couples that only see each other during the happy couple weekends
A lot of the footage looked like from the show.
I'm married and don't have this much content with my spouse. like damn.
I was thinking the same thing lol. I've been with my boyfriend for a decade and we don't have close to this amount of footage together.
I was thinking this! I’ve been with my husband for 5 years and would have trouble pulling this much footage together 😂
same! that man needs to know how out of his league she is! (and im not talking just about looks, she seems like someone that has a lot of good qualities you dont come across everyday).
Loved that part
Yeah I know nothing but Kaity honestly reminds me a lot of Lauren (not in a bad way) but she seemed to just want Zach to choose her in the end and doesn’t really seem bugged by how they got there, which makes me optimistic for them.
Literally my first thought was why no bathroom pic
Why was this my first thought 😂
You mentioned THAT photo?  ![gif](giphy|f8lDluiWJ7yQTtdS3L|downsized)
This is exactly what I was going to comment 😂
Hahaha
I agree! This video is a way sweeter view into their relationship than any scene from the season
Totally! It's difficult not to root for her, she is so sweet!
Definitely think his love language is physical touch
Maybe now that MF is gone
She smiles a lot and it really lights up her face which I think adds to it too! (She is really beautiful, not disagreeing, I think the smiling just makes her especially breathtaking and we aren’t used to it with most of the contestants lol)
Totally agree!
Agreed! Rooting for these two
I completely agree. It’s as if they didn’t meet on a dating show!
This was my fav. So sweet.
Yep, I was thinking the same thing!
Omg him making a cross eyed goofy face made me think of the exact same thing, don’t ask me to explain it pls
Hahaha noooo don’t remind me of that pic
Lmao love her energy.
I’m the documenting friend of my friend group and always have been. I consider it an illness
Some people live on their phones & film everywhere for some reason
Same haha
This was my exact same thought too lol
He seems to have more personality in this small clip than we saw all season
I actually don’t mind zach but your comment is 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Zach’s season wasn’t that popular, so I don’t think they’re gonna have to deal with much public pressure in regards to their lasting potential tbh.
I'm honestly annoyed we didn't get more happy Kaity/Zach content in the final few episodes!! The Gabi drama was great TV, I get it, but it needed to be balanced out by a great love story. They were SO CLOSE. I feel like they tried to manufacture a Sean Lowe story, and when it didn't go right, they just leaned into the fallout. I wish they'd just let things play out naturally, because that manufactured feeling is exactly what the show does wrong.
I think he will go down as one of bachelors like Sean who was truly there for love hands down .
He made mistakes and I’m sure he regrets hurting gabi and how he went about things ,but compared to his predecessors he not most horrible or problematic lead they have had .
Diana argon! I see it
OMG! Haha I was trying to figure it out all season 🤣
Yes but minus the choking and bathroom shots so clearly this is better.
I feel like this is just a common influencer-type thing to do, right?
They used to show us happy couple footage 🥺
i feel like your theory checks out in that’s one of the footage was from the time on the show (eg the typewriter on their 1:1) but wasn’t the exact footage we saw on the show
This seems much more natural than Clayton and Susie.
Abigail and Noah did it too
No way Zach would have had to call a house meeting to tell all the women if they had.
That dude is weird af, so yeah
What's sad about setting up a camera before moments like that? If the feelings are genuine who cares?     EDIT: Just rewatched it.. its all selfie videos or a someone holding them... That's about as minimal set up as you can get.
This is all I can think of when I see these videos
Same. Like I like Kaity. I really do but I just liked Gabi more.
Time will tell but I think they have much better odds than Susie and Clayton.  For one, there was a time when Susie was ok with ending things with Clayton on the show, and Kaity never wavered when it came to wanting to be with Zach. I think their feelings for each other are wayyyy more mutual than Susie and Clayton.  Also, S & C were facing an absolute shit storm after the show and Clayton was not ok mentally. People are not happy with how Zach handled things with Gabi, but they seem to have a lot of support as a couple already.
I mean it seems like they might just have real lives to attend to 🤷‍♀️
They are both going back to their jobs.  They don’t have unlimited time off
Kaity has been back at her job since filming ended. She probably needed to get back to go to work. Zach is packing and moving to Austin. They have life they need to tend to.
i thought zach was driving to texas this week? he said after their trip he was gonna fly to CA to get his belongings and then make the road trip to TX
I don’t see it. I think she looks exactly like Francesca Aiello.
They can’t win.  They post they are criticized.  They don’t everyone will say they are on the rocks.  But they have plenty of things to talk and chat outsiders a couple clips.  Many seem to be from SHVs when they could do nothing
Are you in your husband influencers?   Also, they’re not live-streaming their relationship. She made one video of clips
They’re contractually obligated to promote their relationship for the franchise. (Is what I think)
😂😂😂 Accurate.
Weird comment. They’re one of the few final couples who have kept their jobs so far.
They have jobs.
I mean I think we all know both couples have/had sex lol. I don’t think Kaity needs to monitor her posting just because Gabi didn’t get picked. Gabi could choose not to follow Kaity just like Gabby and Rachel choose not to follow Susie.
 astrid and kevin actually have personalities
I tried using that app and then the pandemic hit LOL it got too grim to continue. But it looked cool up until then!
He actually said he was living in California while the season was airing! He's moving back to Austin soon though.
I believe some of these were on shv visits  in LA not in Austin , I don’t believe they had  any shv visits in Texas at all .
The only Lauren I could think of with your comment was Lauren Lane (of Lauren and Ben), which is so immensely the opposite of what you’re saying - homegirl was definitely bothered by how they got there - so I was super confused at first. I realize that you must have meant Lauren and Arie, and the comparison made so much more sense!
100% agree and could see that as the season was winding down. His F3 was aware of what goes on that week, did not have on rose colored glasses(though Zach might had).  Kaity has grown on me, was more a fan of Gabi but I could start to tell he isn't right for Gabi, whereas Kaity I see having a more compatible relationship with him. Gabi needs someone who will have great communication with her, and not just cut her off etc.
I agree w this analysis!
Haha I’m glad some people share my sense of humor!
lol I know you mean mike fleiss by this but MF still made me laugh
Her smile reminds me of Julia Roberts a lot.
same lol
For sure! It’s because producers purposely edit out their personalities. Matt James is the perfect example of that.
I take some small, small consolation in the fact that we got to see such good women friendships and support this season. We might not have seen exactly how great Kaity was with Zach, but we definitely saw how beloved and respected she was amongst the women, and that was an absolute breath of fresh air.
And that brings me so much respect for him for taking the process seriously. I wish that’s how it always went instead of clout chasers going on lol
I agree. It’s impossible to make it to the end without hurting someone. And there wouldn’t be a show if multiple people didn’t make it to the end.
why would you remind me of that
yeah this looks like every other lovey dovey couple tiktok
This lmao WAY MORE NATURAL theirs were so cringe the toilet pic 🤢
It was outside sex week so it doesn’t count!
It feels disingenuous.  Wait, let’s sup up a camera before we dance in the living room. Wait let’s set up a camera before we do this or that.
Zach isn’t even working for Oracle right now. He’s just hanging out in California and has been since filming wrapped.
Which job?  Travel nurse or kaitylanepr?
Even better! Yes! 👍🏼 🤌🏽
that commenter probably thinks Becca Kufrin cries every time Lauren and Arie post their kids because the fact that they have kids shows they have been having - *gasp!* - THE SEX!!!!! so rude to Becca for Larie to reproduce /s
Of course every couple has sex. It’s just not necessary to share an after sex video clip when you have plenty of other clips to show your relationship and you presumably don’t want to remind people of all the sex drama from the show. She said that Gabi was a close friend, too.
Oh yeah my one second of that time would be my bedroom wall x 30 🙈☠️😂
Oh I didn’t know that! Interesting
Hahaha YES, Aries Lauren!
😂😂😂 me too!!!
Matt is a great example. I think Zach’s season would have been more popular if they had shown this side of him.
The women this season were awesome!! Zach might've had the best F4 ever. I know he made mistakes and deserved criticism, but I think the company we keep says a lot about us. I also loved that he didn't reward drama because it set a great tone for the house. It was so nice to focus on genuine friendships and to not have a true villain, for once. I mean, there was Christina Mandrell, but she was too likable to seem villainous. I want more of that!!
That was my thought as well!  It’s refreshing
That was my thought as well!  It’s refreshing
ok it seems i'm not really in the loop of what is common for couples to do these days? I really am rooting for these guys. i am a fan of both zach and kaity separately as people, and also together :)
Wait what? Only heard of the nurse job
I just… don’t think she needs to consider Gabi in everything she posts lol. Not everything is about her and she’s allowed to post whatever she wants of her and Zach.
What makes you think it’s an “after sex” video lol
Couldn't agree more. Like him or loathe him, he trimmed the toxic fat early and his group of girls is by far my favorite ever. Sick of seeing horrible people rewarded.

It’s not that she needs to agonize over every tiny thing and pretend to be miserable. The whole video is lovey dovey and showing off their relationship and happiness. It’s just a little strange to also make a point of including a “look we are naked in bed together” video clip when that isn’t something that’s typical of any couple to share. It comes across as going out of your way to make things feel awkward and dredge up old bad feelings about what went down on the show and was the focus of the entire end of the show. And being a good friend is actually about considering your friends feelings when you can.
Even if it’s not, that’s clearly the look they’re going for. He appears to be naked and is partly in the sheets of the bed.
that email address is for brand partnerships or press inquiries. zach has one too. it looks like instead of signing with an “influencer agent” (is that even what they are called?) they are going to handle that themselves.  they both said they’re going back to work and might do the influencing bit “on the side”—so i think that’s what the email is for
I think you’re heavily projecting tbh. Kaity can post what she wants and if Gabi doesn’t wanna see it she can mute her. I really don’t like the idea that Kaity has to curate her whole ig feed to be sensitive to Gabi. She’s allowed to be happy and post whatever she wants. If it bothers Gabi she should do what she needs to to protect her peace
I’m what world isn’t that typical? I have countless videos of my boyfriend in bed shirtless, none of them taken after sex.
&#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/to65jx3m35sa1.png?width=1044&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a313af0ac0fe4e4612ea126be12e53b64ca1c951  Zach is not linking any pr email address.  And so far, he is sharing content created by the show, People magazine or kaitylanepr.  The pr job will take more time if they manage it themselves.
It’s odd to accuse someone you don’t know of “projecting” as part of your argument— you should be able to make a strong case without insulting the other person. I’ve certainly never been put in a position like this before on either side— as I said it’s about being a little bit sensitive to a friend and generally not trying to  redraw attention publicly to the crappy stuff that happened on the show. And of course every public figure’s social media accounts are very heavily and carefully curated. As I said I like Kaity but it’s ok to not support every single thing a public personality does. As I said when I was pregnant I gave a bit of thought to what I posted because I had a friend who was struggling to get pregnant. That’s what good friends do. So I find it odd to say that no one needs to give any thought to what they do and how it might affect others. And in this case, it’s not typical to post shirtless videos of a boyfriend in bed anyway, so it feels purposeful.
I rarely see anyone post on social media video clips of their girlfriend or boyfriend shirtless in bed. It’s just not typical and a bit insensitive given the circumstances. I mean, I stayed very reserved with posting about being pregnant when I knew I had a friend who was trying to get pregnant and struggling. I also wouldn’t post videos of my boyfriend shirtless in bed on social media  if he had broken the heart of a friend of mine, and slept with her and then told people without asking her first. 🤷🏻‍♀️
I agree w the other commenter, the email she listed is for PR requests from media or brands. I work in PR, and see multiple influencers who use emails like this when they don’t have agents/agencies
oooh he used to have zachshallcrosspr@gmail.com in his bio, that sly fox must have changed his mind
Infertility struggles are so different than this. I think you are just a jealous person. My best friend had fucked my exboyfriend (before we dated) and I dated him for two years. Knowing his Dick had been in my best friend. Literally didn’t care at all lol. Like you realize Gabi saw it all on tv anyway lol. You must be a troll. All these people are on a tv show knowing they have a 1/30 chance of being the winner
I truly believe Zach was on the show to find a wife.  I do not thing that of Kaitylanepr.  I think she went on the show for the adventure and influencer lifestyle.
If your argument is strong, you should be able to make it without resorting to personal insults towards the person you’re debating with. As I’ve said, I like Kaity and I’ve liked her all season- I’m glad it worked out for her and I wish the best for her and Gabi. I just don’t agree with this one thing. As for Susie and Clayton, I actually strongly didn’t like Clayton and felt neutral about Susie, and yet when I first started watching her montage video I thought this is actually kinda cute! But then the shirtless in bed clips after the sex drama from the season just seemed tasteless.   If you and your friend felt fine about dating the same guy more power to you. Gabi was clearly very deeply hurt and felt public shame- she was visibly very upset even on after the final rose. And Kaity describes her as a good friend.
I guess I just don’t think kaity owes Gabi that. And Gabi was my favorite the entire time.

iirc GOR had to track one down in an Australian library and STILL couldn’t find one season. Big task ahead. I bet if you message Dark Seeker on insta she might be willing to share a little bit of their journey and what it was like.
LOVE this effort, commenting for visibility!
I think our (fans) best bet at this point is hope that someone has them on video tapes. I’m not even joking. Good luck finding any; you can’t buy them ANYWHERE
I absolutely will, I completely forgot that they tried to track all of them down for their book!
Never been a caller but i remember one youtube episode they forgot to edit out the part when the caller comes on and he tells them what to say after he says “how’s it going”
i was a caller in 2019!! i wrote an email, got a reply & had to download skype. then on the call i was introduced & just repeated what i had emailed and nick and his guests gave me advice - all very chill
Only kinda related, but I go through phases of being obsessed with these advice type of podcast episodes (used to be Nick’s, more recently Dear Shandy) and then I have to take long breaks because I find myself subconsciously comparing my life and relationship to these dramatic situations and it stresses me out lol. Has anyone else noticed feeling like this??
I have gotten really in to his advice podcasts lately and have wanted to try calling in from this exact curiosity. Im so fortunate to not have any reason to call in, though, haha.
On a similar note I’m curious if anyone has called in or emailed to Dear Shandy.
No but I have been thinking about emailing in about my freinds relationship. Cause I think they should break up but I didn't think it was that deep
People have commented in here about calling, yeah
That’s not as bad as one caller saying her real name during the chat and then correcting herself with the fake name, and they didn’t edit it out
We’re gonna need to know which episode this is 😂
What does he tell them to say?
Do you know which episode?? Would love to find this
omg that’s so funny
Was it good advice?!
100000%! I have to take breaks also lol
Since you listen to his advice episodes, Do you happen to know if they ever did a follow up for the caller on Raven’s (love is blind) episode? She found out her best friend was cheating several weeks prior and was supposed to go on a couples vacation with her best friend. They said they’d do a follow up but I only listened to that episode for Raven.
omg i don’t remember that one, that is bad🤦🏼‍♀️
*For privacy's sake, let's call her Lisa S. No, that's too obvious. Uh, let's say L. Simpson.*
I heard that too!!
i have no memory of which one it specifically was but it wasn’t that long ago…. maybe end of 2022? ill try and go back and figure it out
their fake name, age, and why they’re calling
honestly my situation had already resolved by the time we did the call but i still wanted to meet nick so i just remember that what they said was fine but not really relevant to me anymore
Yeah he’s teased it as a “can’t miss it” update a bunch behind his new patreon thing called Viall Files Plus. So I know the update lives there but I haven’t heard it since I’m not paying for his content. At least I haven’t hit that point yet.
Why a fake name if they only give their first name?
The caller told her boyfriend who told the boyfriend of the cheater. They didn’t break up yet though
incase someone recognizes their voice idk lol
Thanks!
Do you know who I don’t want to see? Ashley and jared
Anyone else feel like they are just doing research for paradise when watching the regular seasons?
I’m here for the christina mandrell chaos
Anyone who is open to dating multiple people and won’t couple up after one day.
deandra & nayte!!
My wishlist vs. who I think we’ll actually get are two very different lists 😭 my #1 request is the single F1s. They’re so dumb if they don’t get Nayte, Susie, and Blake M on that beach.  * Zach: Jess, Aly, Kat, Brooklyn, Mercedes, Kylee, Genevie, Davia, Christina (a good mix of dramatic characters and potential romance) * Gabchel: Aven, Jordan V, Spencer S * Past seasons: Bri, Clayton, Jasmine N, Alex B, Riley, Dr. Joe, Kristina (I doubt most of them would go, but this is a wishlist lol)
Jordan V., please & thank you.  https://preview.redd.it/qi3d0xu6szra1.jpeg?width=1120&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=854cd921d7781492da703099ce92022b805ce9f7  (He posted this pic 3 days ago. He’s gunning for Paradise & he def. reads here. 😅)
Nayte, Kylee, Deandra, and Mercedes. so I can see who Nayte would choose between them and we’ll hear about Deandra & Nayte’s history  Rachel R, Genevieve, Brianna, Jordan V, Clayton, Leroy, Anastasia, Nate, Aven, Tyler N, Michael V, Mario, PJ Henderson(Michelle’s season, firefighter), Bri, Marlena
I can definitely do without Greer
I want Rachel and Clayton there at the same time,  Michelle, Gabi, Johnny again and maybe even Nayte for peak chaos? But at the same time I don't want them to do that to Michelle
I don't need another Shanae season of anything. She's had more than enough screen time.
Ethan (is he single? I forget) because he’s hilarious and 🔥
Please no more leads. Michelle would be so protected they will pull 3 roses out of thin air for her just in case, if she is ever in a triangle…
Blake Moynes.
Elyse from Cassie’s season.
Unpopular opinion but if we’re gonna bring on a recent lead I’d prefer Gabby to Michelle and/or Rachel. Michelle will be too protected and won’t bring either drama nor much entertainment, and although I like Rachel, I’m not sure I’ll like her as much if she’s in my tv having meltdowns again lol. At least Gabby will bring the funny moments. Although I think she’d only go if there were some new guys, unless she likes a prior season guy on the low key.
Clayton needs his redemption arc. I vote for him.
Charity’s season (just based on looks at this point)  - Warwick  - John B - John Henry   Zach’s season  - Aly - Anastasia  - Ariel - Bailey -Christina Mandrel  - Gabi - Jess  -Olivia L  Gabby/Rachel - Spencer S (for some reason I feel like he’s destined to get engaged on paradise and my guess is Jess) - Jordan V - Jason A - meatball James  - Aven   Other I would want to see  1. Susie Evans 2. Bri Springs  3. Magi Tareke  - Kim Li (Matt’s season)  4. MJ (problematic but I feel like she would thrive)  5. Sarah Trott  6. Always down for Tahzjuan to be there  7. Tayshia (but I don’t think she’d do the show again)  8. Super random pick but Ashley Leubke from Aries season (always remember people saying she was funny but she had no screen time was besties with becca)  9. Caroline Lunny 10. Tyler C obviously  11. Pilot Pete  12. Jason Foster 13. Nayte 14. Leroy  15. John Paul Jones  16. Pardeep  17. Jack Russell (Michelle season)  18. Justin without Andrew  19. Christian Smith 20. Ben Smith 21. Grant Eckel 20. Elyse Dehlbohm  22. Kristina Schumann   Overall, bring back casting random people with the popular ones because it brings the most unusual unexpected love stories, which are usually the best ones
🗣️ __*BRYAN WITZMANN!*__  Also: Nayte and not Michelle. Michelle is too protected by TPTB and we would either see Nayte getting demonized or a bunch of boring crying drama
No Greer. Add in Gabi
Gabi, Ariel, Aly, Brooklyn, Kat, Jess, Christina, Rachel R, Gabby  Tyler N, Aven, Nayte, Clayton, Alex B, Jordan V  I could see Jess with either Tyler N or Jordan, Ariel and Alex B, maybe Kat and Nayte or Christiba Mandrell abd Nayte
Tyler C, Gabi, Rachel R, Susie, Clayton, Brooklyn, Kat, Deandra, Natye, Michelle (the drama I need),
Gabby! Jess!  Rachel  Bri  Greer  Gabi  Ariel  Jasmine  Christina Susie
I could see Michelle coming on paradise but sadly she wouldn’t be a top pic for me lol too boring
Jess jess jess jess jess
I could see Gabi and Clayton being a match in Paradise. Both enthralled in main game sex scandals. And Gabi is quirky, beautiful and bubbly just like Susie. Clayton gives off big goofy jock vibes like Zach.
I do not want to see any recent leads back on bip. no clayton, rachel r or gabby w.  we just saw them last year and we need at least one year off from them. I'm sorry they're all single but it's time to see new folks shine!   for women I'd like to see most of zach's cast and susie and bri from matt's season. for guys I'd like to see some of charity's cast, aven, ethan, jason a, jordan race driver guy, nayte, ben and riley from tayshia's season.  if there has to be a former lead I hope it's a throwback lead who's been off tv for 3 or more years like becca k.
If Ariel goes on I’d like to see some really quality guys.
 No Greer please and thank you   Gabi, Ariel, Brooklyn, Kat, Genevie, Mercedes, Rachel R, Christina Mandrell, Aly, Davia  Aven, Nayte, Quincy, Spencer, Meatball, Ethan, Leroy, Clayton, Blake Moynes
Jess, Ariel, Kat from this past season   the chaotic part of me would love to see Michelle and Nayte both there 💀💀  Gabby W if some older Charity guys are there… if it’s mainly her and Rachel’s guys… wait til next season.
Wish list? Tyler C, Michelle, Nayte, Gabi, Rachel R, and Ariel.  ETA: Susie and Clayton!!
Good list but id take Anastasia over Kat. I wasn’t a big Kat fan and I think Anastasia would be drama plus she’s gorgeous
Mercedes, Jess and Jordan V  Edit: to add in Quincy!
Zach’s: Aly, Brooklyn, Kat, Ariel  Gabchel’s: Aven, Jason, Jordan, Tyler  Michelle’s: Nayte, Pardeep, Leroy  Matt’s: Bri, Magi  Clayshia’s: Zac Clark
Slightly off topic but Anyone know when they start filming?
Women: Ariel, Gabi, Jess, Kat, Mercedes, Greer, Bailey, Anastasia, Davia, Bri, Susie     Men: Alex B(I think this might be his cast!), Andrew, Peter K, Jordan V, Ethan, Aven, Nate, Jason, Rick(he was robbed last year), Blake M
Mercedes is the most gorgeous contestant to have ever appeared in this franchise. Just refreshingly beautiful and natural.
I present to you Exhibit A  https://www.reddit.com/r/thebachelor/comments/124w3uc/bip_2023/je1r22z/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1&context=3
Aaron   Always Aaron
From Zach's Season  Gabi  Christina  Jess  Mercedes  Brooklyn  Ariel  From Previous Seasons  Susie E.  Gabby  Tyler N.  Jordan V.  Shanae  Aven  Andrew S.
Tyler C, Nayte, Ben Smith, Susie, Bri. I know they tend to choose people from recents seasons but I don’t really care for the cast from Zach’s season. Nothing wrong with them but they’re forgettable.
- Ariel - Gabi - Kat - Aly - Jess - Genevie - Kylee - Mercedes
Blake Moynes! He comes off to me as a decent dude who would make a great partner and seems to handle the pressure of reality tv okay!
Zach’s season:  • Christina Mandrell  • Brianna   • Brooklyn  • Katherine   • Jess  • Aly  Gabby and Rachel’s season:  • Floppy Hair Nate  • Aven   • Ethan  • Jordan V  • Meatball  • Mario  • Roby the magician  • Justin and Joey Round 2  • Chris (the guy that talked about Fantasy Suites during Week 2, just for some fun drama)   Clayton’s season:  • Rachel  • Gabby  • Susie   • Eliza Round 2  • Cassidy   • Sarah Round 2  • Shanae Round 2  • Mara Round 2  Michelle’s season:  • Nayte   • Rick   Katie’s season:  • Andrew Round 2  • John H (the one who dated Katie post-show)  • Brendan (the guy that made it to the week before hometowns and got zero screen time)   • Tre Round 2 (without Aaron or James)  • Hunter  Matt’s season:  • Michelle  • Bri  • Brittney G Round 2  • Chelsea Round 2  • Magi   • Heather Martin  I don’t think they’ll pull from earlier than Matt James’s season. It’s been too long to pull from Hannah, Pilot Pete, or Clayshia’s season.
[removed]
Can we get Fictroria F if she's not with Greg G anymore?  Can we get Katie T?
I really hope Brooklyn is there. I need more of her one liners on my tv every week.
Please God no. And the farts?  ![gif](giphy|3o7TKOnPukgWDLPBPq)
I have never been given an award before I feel honored in all our shared hatred of wasted time last year 🥰
Omg maybe we should start a Paradise NOT-list
I would keep clicking that 15(>) every time they would start talking. I don’t dislike them, and appreciate showing success stories, but that was waayyy too much screen time.
I did not really care for Zach, so that is definitely what I considered it!
That the regular seasons are just auditions? Interesting thought
Same!
Yes. I hate that people couple up after one date. Like Shanae was really the only one who explored.
Ohhh Bri, that’s a good one!! I wonder if she’d actually do it
I want to see Blake M and Katie's ex John both on the beach 🤪
I’m shocked Blake hasn’t been on paradise
Okay. I will take Alex B anytime all the time!
Gunning for Jordan and Jess
what makes you think he reads here?
Yes, yes to a Jordan V and Jess match!!
He’s so fine!
Okay, I didn’t think about the men. But, you’re spot on!
Same. Please no Greer. She is incredibly emotionally immature and her personality grates on my last nerve.
Spelled Gabby wrong but both Gabby Windey and Gabi from this season would be great on the beach
Ooh a Rachel and Clayton meet in BIP would be spicy. How often is it that former leads join BIP?
Oh yes, I wish Ethan had the airtime he needed for his wit!
Gabby is more mature than Rachel. She has climbed her way out of the negative public opinion ranks. She probably shouldn’t do paradise.
no gabby w and rachel r please. they were just on clayton's season and were bachelorettes just last year. it's way too soon. gabby was on 3 shows last year so they already got lots of exposure. I'd like to see new people.
he was just a lead last year. it's too soon. also he's giving talks on mental health given how hard he took being on the show. it would be weird for him to come back on tv so quick.
I think he would be good on the beach too
LOL 'Justin without Andrew'
Yasss this is a good list.
omg yes! I matched with him on an app but he didn’t message me back and it broke my heart a little haha
Nayte is getting a bad edit regardless. One he has a girl he’s been seeing for a while now with a sizable amount of followers. Is he ditches her for filming she is going to reality Steve and her followers and he will just mess around women on the beach and not take any serious because he has no interested in marriage or engagement   Zero chance of a good edit for nayte
Yeah. I do want the drama, but I don’t want anything too serious though. Give me chaos please!
I love Gabi. Just worried how BIP would be for her
Jess and Tyler N for sure! I didn’t think of that!
I can see Michelle going, I’m just not sure how much fun I can see her having, esp if they bring nayte on.
The match I never thought about but can definitely see now!
Or she would leave because she doesn’t wanna waste her time. She’s such a gem though!
Omg how did I forget Meatball. For some reason, I’m curious to see him on the beach.
Omg yes to Susie and Clayton!
I find both of them gorgeous TBH. I just get the ick from hearing Anastasia talk about anything. She gives off contrived, calculated vibes to me.
Jordan V (from Rachel R’s season?) and Jess seem like they’re made for each other
Probably early June
What is itching but a lower kind of pain?
He and James should be there just to host parties. I’d watch them ryhthmically punch water at pool parties for years.
Katie is pretty much done with the franchise.
Yes! Love her one-liners
They’d be so cute
That actually would be a great coupling!
Rachel lost all credibility after sending him home
I'll take Gabi from this season, she's ready to find someone. I don't feel like Gabby W is serious about finding a partner/seems like she would go to get more exposure/fame.
Pretty rare, I think only Becca is gone on as a former lead. Tayshia, Colton, Nick, Clare all went on before they became leads.
Omg girl I’m so sorry 😭😭 I’m obsessed with him and people on here always tell me to go get him on the apps but I know he’d ignore my ass too!!! I don’t even care, I wanna see that *big body* on the beach regardless
Who’s the girl??
Kat does too though in my opinion, kat is just more boring
I was thinking exactly that when I wrote my comment haha and I think they follow each other too
Oooh I remember the first BIP
I've seen her talk about dressing modestly before, and I feel like there's lots of times I would never call how she dresses modest. Crop tops and short shorts/dresses are not modest. Now, she usually looks great, and I'd never say anything about what she was wearing at all if she weren't also speaking about being modest. It just doesn't align with what she's preaching at all.
Just wear an over-sized t-shirt! That’s what they gave us 10-13 year old girls at church camp to make sure we weren’t being whores and tempting the prepubescent boys 😁
How is this modest? Because she’s got 2% body fat? Nothing about that would be considered modest if I shoved my 30E’s into it lmao
I hear “modest swimwear,” I think of a  burkini or something the Duggars would wear. Madi’s definition of modest based on both this and her normal wardrobe just seems to mean no cleavage.
Using Jesus to sell swimsuits is…a choice.
Bestie... those are not "modest" swimsuits by any stretch of the imagination
JoJo’s Cupshe collection is more covered & forgiving (& cuter!) than Madison’s & she’s not using the “modest” narrative to sell the line.  https://preview.redd.it/7vg5czg4wyra1.jpeg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=67838d62b315e354afbbf26b0f44ce51cd19b24d  ETA: [more pics of JoJo’s collection.](https://www.eonline.com/news/1333023/the-bachelorette-jojo-fletcher-swimsuit-collection-collection)
Swimsuits that “align with her faith”? Are they bottoms that say “WORTH THE WAIT”?
I promise Jesus does not care about what kind swimsuit you are wearing, Madi
Ok I have officially switched over to team Barb  🙃
I'll echo what so many others have said already! It just looks "modest" because she doesn't have much up top.  I've always been busty. The rest of me is usually a size 2/4, and my chest can look cartoonishly large in some things. My mom is flat-chested and has always made snarky comments about how some things look on me. I had a dress with a high neck that was loose, but just clung to me in a particular way, and my mom told me I looked like a porn star because of my large chest! I just brought this gorgeous floral dress for Easter and I actually joked that it looked like something Jill Biden would wear, and my mom told me it looked "slutty" because of my boobs (it wasn't even low cut!)  So, yes, I am over this! If I put on Madi's suit, I wouldn't pass the modesty test.
i’m confused because Madi doesn’t dress “modest” in the traditional sense of the word. like… she wears short shorts and crop tops. so i don’t understand when modesty became so crucial for her
As someone who grew up in a modest, Christian environment, I can tell you I would’ve been ripped apart if I wore this in public around my church family - pearl clutching & a lecture on keeping my body modest and pure would be hammered into me 😂 I grew up in the world where it was one piece only and heaven forbid you went to a co-Ed party, you better be wearing an oversized tee shirt over it.   Madi, this is cash grab and you’re selling normal bikinis. You slap words like “modest, Christian, God” on a product, it’s a dog whistle for the Bible Belt
Oh great, here comes Madi to save us all with her "modest" Jesus approved swimwear line...sweet salvation at last lol 🙄🙄  Also, profiting off of Jesus is weird.
Those on a person with boobs would not be modest
I really want to hear her direct explanation of her definition of modesty, what a modest swimsuit looks like, and how these are “modest.”  There is nothing wrong with wearing swimsuits that are not modest, but when I went to church camps and retreats as a kid, all two-piece swimsuits were immediately off the table. If you wore one anyway, you had to wear a t-shirt over top of it.  Seems like she only calls it “modest” if the person wearing the swimsuit doesn’t have cleavage. 🙄
JUGS FOR JESUS
She thought “how can I combine my two personality traits, being pretty and being Christian?” and this is what she came up with. My Jesus doesn’t care about regular swimsuits but he probably would about the gross ways Christians use their faith to make money
I just don't understand how these bikinis are any more "modest" than a regular bikini? And why Madi is even trying to pretend she cares about modesty. Her style has never been modest.   If she wants a line of bathing suits then fine, good for her, go for it. But not everything needs a religious spin.
As someone who was raised in a very conservative Christian home those two pieces would never have been ok. This isn't modest really.
does child labor and sweat shop conditions align with her faith? or is it just showing not some titty and cheek
As other comments have said these bathing suits aren't even particularly modest, they just seem like normal bathing suits on someone with a smaller chest?   The weird thing is I don't even think of Madison as someone who dresses particularly "modest" - she wears bikinis/mini dresses/crop tops just like every other Bachelor contestant, this just feels like a way to capitalize on her popularity as a Christian influencer.
they look like regular bikinis idk what she’s talking about
Girl, if you want to prove how modest you are, stop preying on young, impressionable fans to make money and police their bodies, and give away your giant ass house to live in a tiny home or something. There’s nothing modest about her lifestyle and it’s just so blatantly hypocritical. I don’t know if she is delusional enough to believe her own contradictions or if she knows exactly what’s she’s doing
Those are regular swimsuits. She’s basically nothing but a scam artist at this point.
a rich woman using God’s name to make more money for herself all the while never using her platform to actually spread God’s message of humility and helping vulnerable people😵‍💫 I dont like to be negative but she is literally everything that is wrong with Christians nowadays. All ego
These would literally give fundamentalists a heart attack for being immodest.  Which is why aligning clothing with faith is absurd. Everyone has a different definition of what’s godly and modest so it’s presumptuous to think your definition is the correct one.  But Madi only cares about profiting off of her narrow understanding of Jesus’ teachings so what does she care?
How is a bikini “modest”?
People don’t seem to take it seriously when we warn them that mega churches are scam cults. People like Madi are taking from people who don’t have the money to spend on this shit, or their concerts, or their special bibles, or their Bible camps, or their Christian support groups, albums, etc. But they will because they’re being constantly berated with this kind of “non ad” that makes them feel it’s the only way to be a better Jesus follower.  This is indefensible because it’s a pattern of behavior of white rich people taking from others. It isn’t about this specific campaign, it is about all of it put together. They’re hoping no one notices the pattern if they spread their endeavors out far enough in time and demographics which they are targeting.  Even their “starter home” that is nice and expensive for normal people has been purposefully chosen because it’s WAY below what they can afford. It’s a marketing campaign to make them seem “relatable.”  Everything about this woman and her husband are marketing scams targeted at Christians. INDEFENSIBLE.
Would my double d’s be considered modest in the bikini, miss madi?
No hate to Madi’s style but I would not call her style modest so idk what she’s doing here
Not me expecting to see hijabi style levels of modesty 💀! Turns out they’re just regular swimsuits. I guess she has to make money somehow
Ok now put this modest suit on someone with boobs larger than an A cup
https://m.cupshe.com/products/x-madison-backless-rashguard-one-piece-swimsuit  Omg my favorite is this long-sleeved bathing suit that doesn’t even cover your ass. But at least no one can see your elbows!
They’re just regular bathing suits on a really thin person
This is such disingenuous money grab. Nothing about this aligns with the modesty movement in clothing. What this is, at its core, is a cash grab that allows the religious right crowd to say, “LOOK LOOK I’M WEARING CHRISTIAN MADI’S MODEST LINE!!!!!” despite the fact they’re no different from Heathen Heather over there in her DD showing bikini. It’s borderline insulting for true modest designers and it’s lack of alignment with actual modest fashion inadvertently sends this bizarre message that showing your shoulders is modest as long as you have JeSuS in your HeArT, but is male gaze seeking for the rest of us.
I just go to like LL Bean’s website for a full coverage swimsuit, but ok
Can she not just put out a swimsuit line and say she likes it and thinks it’s cute? Trying to align this with her faith is strange. These aren’t modest.   No one will think less of you if you just designed some cute swimsuits for Cupshe. Also, not everything has to be a “passion.”   Can this just not be a fun thing you felt like doing? The religious guilt is real.
Someone said on tiktok that Skims has a more ‘modest’ line than this…and it’s true  https://preview.redd.it/9qqmbx659zra1.jpeg?width=1177&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cbdd9da0016b6b5de92dde7b5f0d6a93b6919909
Okay you know what’s ironic about this? I just led a Bible study where we studied the text with Jesus teaching about lust. He says if you look at a woman with lust, you’ve already committed adultery in your heart and to pluck your eye out. Know why? Because it’s a YOU problem, not her problem.
Those are just...regular bathing suits. Anyone mildly busty would not look "modest" in them.
Profiting from piety. Have ye no shame?
Maybe we shouldn’t equate skin showing with moral or religious purity. Women have bodies and that’s ok
can someone tell her that having no boobs doesn’t mean you’re modest, it just means you have no boobs? because growing up in evangelical christianity, if my 32Gs put on those suits I’d get crucified right alongside Jesus.
Her repetition of “learning and growing” reminds me of Joey writing the speech for Chandler & Monica’s wedding: “giving and sharing and receiving and having”….
At my church camp we had to wear t shirts and basketball shorts over a bathing suit. So if there isn’t a version of that this is not christian enough!
Repeat with me. i can wear a bikini and Jesus still loves me 💜
most of her pieces have plunging necklines so they’re not even “modest” i’m ded.  also, if this woman really wants to be part of Christ’s ministry, she needs to use her platform to advocate for real healing and alleviation of suffering in this world, rather than continuing to propagate the destructive purity culture while accumulating wealth and showing off her riches. she’s literally the opposite of Jesus, and doing the opposite of what he commanded.
since she started dating Grant i feel like she kicked her religion up to level 3000 and has made it her personality trait. on the bachelor she honestly didn’t even mention it at all, minus stating she was waiting for marriage, and the months that followed she only lightly mentioned it. now every single god damn week there’s a new laughable quote or interview talking about waiting for marriage or Satan or modesty or whatever the fuck to the point where she’s like an SNL skit
her next promotion will be faith based cook books titled serving jesus
Under his eye
Did you see her modest house bought, no doubt, by her father in law,
These just look like normal swimsuits.
everything i know about madi, i have learned against my will.
Again I say - Pilot Pete’s mom was on to something, ok. JUSTICE FOR BARBARA!!  https://preview.redd.it/lulemkcqbyra1.jpeg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bc1dc9aeb7aef1430954bac778ed5fea3bd1c926
If you want to dress modestly, then dress modestly. But I hate all these religious ppl telling women that God wants them to dress in a certain way. (And how does this bikini fall into any definition of modest?)
she loves modest $800k weddings
Those are just regular swimsuits?? They think everyone who isn’t as “pure” and “demure” as them are running around in thongs. No, plenty of us normal folks wear full coverage suits too, you’re not special. And if someone is comfortable in less, who cares?? Doesn’t mean you can’t wear what you like as well.
I say if I still need a bikini wax to wear it, it's not modest. If I can't cannonball with absolute certainty my boobs and bottom will still be covered...it ain't modest. But modesty is whatever societal bs we say it is. And what the hel...heck about the sleeves? Is it immodest to show arm? I hope it's a super deep V neckline with no nipple guards and one inch of fabric for your vagina...but with elaborate sleeves.
I don't find Madi's wardrobe to be modest at all! She doesn't show a ton of skin and dresses like a regular girl her age which is totally fine and cute but it's not modest! It always really confused me about her.
Is she fucking kidding?! Swimsuits as an expression of religious faith?!?
May the lord open
On the 5th day God said “Two piece swimsuits are OK as long as you are size 2 and I can only see half your ass cheek” 🙏😉
Madi always chanelling her Serena Joy Waterford.
They’re only “modest” on thin women. Anyone with an appreciable amount of ass is going to look more provocative in what are just regular swimsuits
Aren’t these swimsuits created in some fast fashion Chinese factory that basically pays slave labor? Does that also align with your faith, Madi?   I just can’t with these preachy Christian girls anymore
so .... regular swimsuits?
IM SORRY BUT WHERE ARE THE DUGGAR MODESTY PANELS AND SHORTS?  1. I’ve seen all these designs before. You can probably go on cupshe and find the same dress in a different drop down menu.   2. How are any of swimsuits modest? Ladies, if you want modesty hit up Lands End. You’re welcome.
Her idea of a modest bikini is pastel colors and heart designs
As a Christian woman I really strongly feel like telling people how to dress or how to “look Christian” is toxic and turns a lot of people away from the faith. It also creates a sense of shame. AND these swimsuits aren’t even modest lol
This gives me flashbacks to high school youth group when my swimsuit would be too revealing because I had boobs and hips but if someone was skinny… the Christian’s don’t care
These are considered modest…?
![gif](giphy|DPqqOywshrOqQ|downsized)
Who tf is passionate about modesty
These are not “modest”🤣
She's doing too much using/exploiting her faith to shill/sell that it may backfire on her one day.
she also blatantly copied Blackbough Swim’s design. like not even a tweak here and there, just legit SAME thing SAME design
Give me a fucking break.
She just uses Christianity and God to sell her brands. It’s like that scummy musician that rode the Christian music circuit from Jojos season.
This is not modesty. If she wants to come out with a line of swimsuits... fine. She can just say this is a style that she likes or prefers. But why invoke religion? There are religions where modesty for women is required or suggested. These women usually have their shoulders and arms covered, or their heads covered and wear long skirts because showing any skin is a no-no.
What about these is Christian? One of those is so high cut I am pretty sure I see labia
Nobody asked for this, and Jesus would be against the sweatshops that make these. Who believes anything this girl says anymore? Why isn't she out in the world helping people and showing Christians how to be jesus-like through service instead of speaking a bunch of empty words on Instagram and then doing this crap? 🤮
My question is: why does she get to determine what is modest 🤔
This girl is ridiculous. Like my god just admit you wanna be famous and be an influencer.   No, god didn’t make you go on the bachelor  No, god isn’t calling you to make “modest” swimwear
How does a swimsuit align with her faith 😅
https://preview.redd.it/q4xi8smleyra1.jpeg?width=680&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f9866de51198efa1e00b9dc7717f16e27e562675
Madi: I love jesus and he loves my *modest* swimsuit line. He would not be bothered at all by my support of an unethical fast fashion company.  Jesus:  ![gif](giphy|SDjxUclbm4sf8sB6uY)
It’s interesting how people debate what “modest” means. I think it shows how ridiculous modesty culture can be.
![gif](giphy|WmzU61mQc5M94AbLGS|downsized)
I just can't...  ![gif](giphy|hvq8ONQhQ1XLq)
As a big titty girl, almost none of these would be “Modest” on me lol
Madison is the last person I associate with modesty, from her clothing to her lifestyle.
I find it hard to believe that a billionaire would be wearing cupshe but okay
“But I still feel that that still appreciate the modest approach. We still wanted it to be, like, trendy and beautiful, but also modest. I really feel like the swimsuits do a good job of that.” Either a really sloppy typo from Us Weekly or she doesn’t know how to speak English
Lol "engagement season" is not a thing if you have an actual personality
These are as modest as I am a natural blonde. (I’m not blonde at all except a few years ago when I bleached my hair for shits and giggles and ruined it)
Not to be the worst, but the looking at the [full selection here](https://www.cupshe.com/collections/cupshe-x-madison-prewett-wedding-collection), the thing that is modest about most of these is that Madi isn’t juggy. If I wore 50% of these my rack would be on full display. You can tell with the other models. Which then, like, what’s the point? What about them is modest or aligned with her faith? It’s cool to just put out a bridal line. You don’t need to lie about modesty.
Lol these are only modest because she’s a size 0. Get a normal, size 6 or 8 girl with boobs in that swimsuit madi will be clutching her cross, praying to Jesus for forgiveness
already said this on her snark, but it’s crazy to me that the only reason these would be modest is due to her body type. for her to act like it’s been so hard to find modest swimwear for herself is a joke imo if this is what she’s putting out.  if it was me wearing these, it would be “sinful” etc. they’re also cheap as hell coming from cupshe. what a scam, and what a way to make christian girls that aren’t very thin feel disgusting about themselves & their faith.
What’s the heathen alternative? Pasties & nipple tassels?
She’s really profiting off her faith. Smart business move.
I’m confused, they’re just regular swim suits? Anything to make a buck off the name of Jesus I guess, I’m sure he’d love that!
I’m still trying to figure out why Madi came on the Bachelor when the show itself is in direct opposition to her faith. Last time I checked, the Bible doesn’t advocate for open relationships, which is essentially what the bachelor is
Jesus answered, “If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.”  When the young man heard this, he went away sad, because he had great wealth.  Then Jesus said to his disciples, “Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven. Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.”
of course they’re modest looking on her- she’s skinny with no tits. anyone with above a C cup would look “sinful” and “promiscuous” in those tops bc their tits would be out- BC ITS A BATHING SUIT! i don’t even have big boobs- i have a C cup- but i know the girls would be out to play (and that’s not a bad thing in the first place) but just reminds me of high school and getting dress coded for wearing the same top other girls were wearing, but they just had smaller boobs
![gif](giphy|N7FeGLHjVsDQY)
It’s all one huge grift…if that wasn’t already abundantly clear. Smh.
Whatcha wanna bet there will also be no plus size options
My reaction to everything if I knew her irl.  ![gif](giphy|l0HU2QpFqukBfMLD2)
I for one have always hoped for a swimwear line that covers a single extra inch of skin around my ribcage. Before that, the entire effect was incredibly unchristian. Now that I have the extra inch, I can sail forth into church club without even putting pants on.
I'm waiting for it to come out in like 10 years that this was all a long con and she hooked up with Peter on the show.
She could’ve just promoted the swimsuits, without making it about god. Even if your faith and god are the most important thing to you, it does not mean that god has a connection to swimsuits.
Didn’t she wear the regular revealing dresses everyone else wears on the bachelor? I wouldn’t ever consider her modest
Also, these swimsuits are just ugly, right? Without all of the other things wrong with this scenario, they are basic and look like something my younger sisters (young teens) wouldn’t even want to wear
She’s a total charlatan
Did she actually just say she’s wearing a bikini with heart cutouts…for Jesus?
I have thoughts. They’re not nice, so I’ll just keep them to myself.
I’m surprised that she and Luke from Hannah Browns season didn’t date.
"i can excuse the racism, but i draw the line at too much buttcheek."  &#x200B;  \-god
Bunz out for the lord I guess???
I think the Christian modesty thing is just a storyline to sell bathing suits. They look like normal full coverage bikinis. It's not like she's promoting bathing gowns with long sleeves.
Modesty culture 🤝 purity culture 🤝 dehumanizing women and telling everyone that our bodies and natural sexual desires are inherently shameful and sinful
Girl what 😭
this feels like something Jesus flipped tables about
I too am passionate about promoting suimsuits that align with me getting more money, I mean, my faith
Everyone is hating on the swimsuits as if the 11th commandment wasn’t literally “wear the ugliest possible bikini known to man”
Looks like bathing suits at Target.  Nothing different.  Just choose what suits you!
Excuse you, what? 😂
Wouldn’t call that bikini modest but ok
I feel like she would be the type of person who would be offended if someone else wore a burkini. Which you know is the most MODEST you can do  lol
&#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/lb8rzzc560sa1.png?width=254&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7a29f6d45fe6a88d2bea9adff50f7d7345cb2a7c
She is not modest... more than most on a spectrum but no....
![gif](giphy|Wgb2FpSXxhXLVYNnUr|downsized)
These aren’t that modest? My cousin dragged me to Jesus camp one year and when I wore a bikini they told me one pieces only or to wear a shirt over the bikini top.
Sadie Roberson dupe
I really need her to stop trying to impose her puritanical values on everyone.
She's the quintessential Christian grifter - phony and hypocritical with everything she says and does.
\#BarbWeberWasRight
She is not particularly eloquent, if the article is quoting her exactly
If she wants modest she should wear a one-piece with a skirt
I have never had a friend ask me where to shop to attend a bridal shower, a baby shower, a bachelorette party, an engagement party, a rehearsal dinner or a wedding.  My friends know where to shop for their own clothing.
Her swimsuit isn't even modest.
They’re literally just fabric, Madi.
It’s funny that she is so about being Christian while she also worked with Shein, who basically abuses their workers.   The white swimsuit looks exactly like a bikini produced by Shein and a few other palaces that I don’t think are concerned with modesty as much as they’re concerned with sales.
Trying to read this article was a trip   “we have come up with a few really pretty just one-piece swimsuits, which I’m really excited about.  “We do have still some two-piece options”  “But I still feel that that still appreciate the modest approach”
What a load of crap - Rachel green
During Peter's season, I thought that Madi really believed she was the the holiest of the holy. Starting with her Kaitlyn interview, I realized that she is extremely manipulative and adept at using her faith for her own benefit. I went from disliking her for being so smug to completely repulsed by her.
![gif](giphy|LcYPC0SOSZYdO)
 Wow this is so annoying flesh out is flesh out when you are swimming. If it’s not a BURKA or a SCUBA  SUIT it’s not modest
![gif](giphy|XCmFwjt9wPotobw1xn|downsized)
How is this modest lol
Only a madi prew snark post would get this many comments this fast. But as a messy bitch bored in the off season, I love it.
I rolled my eyes so hard
As a fellow Christian, what??!?? Lol!!! WHAT???
People who push their faith/beliefs on others irritate me so much. Like… I get if she thinks a lot of swimwear is immodest/sees a market for this. But what does that have to do with Jesus?
Well dang. Never met a Christian swimsuit. All of mine are atheist 🤷🏻‍♀️
Can’t wait for one of the fundie influencers to call her out.
Madi: “Jesus knows my heart!”  The heart:  https://preview.redd.it/500p7dyhzyra1.jpeg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c495227049c4b8b02fa5a3a126b27dddde92282f  ETA: also notice how she has her wedding band on full display. As if it to signal to her Followers “My husband is okay with this & considers it modest.” 🫠
I would love to see Madison minister to the poor and divest herself of her material wealth with even a tenth of the zeal that she devotes to this overwhelming obsession with her body and the consensual and hopefully mutually pleasurable acts she performs with it under the guise of "faith."  What would she talk about with Jesus, if she met him? How would she explain that her whole life and public persona have been about whether a penis has gone in her vagina and whether someone at the beach saw a flash of the side of her breast? Does she think he'd be interested in that, or proud of her "works"?
The swim suit is just a knockoff of BlackBough
I actually never thought Madi cared about modesty (which I liked, modesty culture sucks). No one who actually cares about modesty would buy that bikini.
Jesus is the ultimate capitalist
tb to when my youth group leaders said I was dressing too revealing and I would appear as a slut since I was developing my chest at a young age.   &#x200B;  also that's such a run on sentence lol stuff like this is so annoying
what does that even mean
Is she straight up part of the duggars now or??
In middle school at church pool parties I had to wear a tank top and shorts over my bathing suit, none of these would pass as modest 😬 cute tho
Swimsuits with a chastity belt that can only be unlocked by the word of God. Sexy and practical!
Oh wait so now you're gonna tell me that there's a modesty culture to go hand in hand with that purity culture too? Are two-piece swimsuits allowed?
Her pieces are so radical and different 🥱
she's doing it for the wrong reasons to get girls on paradise to wear her clothes
you have got to be kidding me….  ![gif](giphy|1lAOemoi0KhPMzxczT|downsized)
Feels relevant to add to this discussion that Madi’s book is kind of fatphobic. I read it out of curiosity and she talks a lot about building habits of discipline and she used the example of “resisting that plate of fresh cookies” multiple times throughout the book. I thought it was super harmful in a book aimed at young women.
We get it Madi. You’re a Jesus freak and a god warrior. 😴😴😴
Im in a bad mood, but why do u need people praying for you 4 1/2 months into your marriage?
Kids are getting murdered in schools but let’s make sure God’s not mad about what we wear during swimmy time. 🙌🏽
The purity 2 piece- it comes with a lock and key.
Yeah... Jesus doesn't like people profiting off of his father's name. He literally flipped tables because of it. God's list of grievances with Madi Prewett Trout is getting longer by the day. She may think she's pulling one over on the Gen Pop but God's about to smite her.
At a 32G I’ve been called a whore and yelled at for showing off in a turtleneck sweater. Modesty is a patriarchal archaic idea. Go right ahead and wear whatever you want, but one of her bikini cups would hardly cover me and I can almost guarantee she would not approve of my chest in it. Supporting the idea of modest is hottest is so misogynistic
What does this even mean? Lmao I can literally see her pelvic bone? What did Jesus say about bikinis? I don’t recall….
As a fellow Christian, I do not approve this message.
so on brand for her to partner with a fast fashion label and then peddle it as moral… aka christian modesty ‘morals’ not like workers rights or the environment
Somehow the words “swimsuits” and “faith” just don’t go together
Madi Prewett played the game better than anyone who ever appeared on the show. She knew her target demographic going in...Christian Conservatives...the Bachelor was a perfect audience demographic for her launch. She parlayed that into a virgin marriage to a billionaire's son, a major multi Christian faith book deal, a solid Christian influencer career, multiple collaborations for wedding wear, swim suits etc...that is a businesswoman. You may not share or respect her beliefs but that woman knows exactly who she is, exactly what she believes in and knows exactly where she wants to go in life and her career. She is an achiever.
I’m so tired of giving people like her a platform, you believe in a certain faith good job. Stop making it your personality and luring people in.   The first comment about Jo Jo’s swim collection is waaayyy cuter. Btw.
I love Jesus but I would never be caught in a swimsuit with a skirt if I’m over the age of 7.   The one bathing suit with the puff sleeve I legit thought was a bodysuit!
Excess fabric is a very serious safety issue when swimming at ocean beaches. More fabric = more water absorbed by fabric = more weight you must pull through the water. It's VERY easy to get caught in a rip and carried out to sea if you don't take proper precautions. People regularly drown for this reason, especially when swimming non-patrolled hours.  That being said, these cossies aren't particularly modest, lol. Is she even selling those short boardies we had in the 90s?
Teaming up with cupshe, I’m sure god loves that!!
I fucking can’t with her. Go away.
she just needs more money i guess
Is this a joke ?
she’s insufferable. can we stop talking about her already
She straight up plagiarized the design from an Asian woman and took all of the credit. Madison is such a smarmy scammer. The brand is called Blackbough and it’s owned by a Filipina woman. Her heart bikini is identical to Madi’s two-piece
I’m usually the first to criticize Madi but everyone pointing out that Cupshe is unethical while the post about Tia working with Abercrombie was full of praise is odd. Abercrombie also uses sweatshops and people have literally died making those clothes, and they refused to re-sign a safety agreement that they signed the year that thousands of people died in Bangladesh at one of these factories to save face. I don’t like Madi (for valid reasons) but if we’re going to criticize influencers for working with unethical brands we should keep that same energy for everyone else too (modesty hypocrisy aside)
“Really” “very” “just” I hate the fundie filler words
Madi, just convince the hubby to go to pastor school and become a pastor's wife. You will be fine.

Yeah I’m sure sky daddy gives a flying fuck about what you wear…all she’s doing is impressing hipster pastors and male elders in her Church community.
One pieces? Madi dont want to show tummy. Only for Trizzy Troutt. 💕
Bikini bottoms with a chastity belt??
Honestly kinda impressed at how she managed to carve out an audience and consumers amongst the uber religious.
Lmaoooo
Madi? Swimsuits?
Didn’t really look at her swimsuits but love more modest options for women’s swimsuits in general. It is impossible to find swim suit bottoms that expose less than most of my actual underwear.
Why does this have almost 500 comments? 😂
Ok, has anyone else seen a huge increase in modest dress videos being recommended in their TikTok/reels? I can’t figure out if it’s because I follow a few bachelor people, or if it’s a trend I should be wary about. (I see you, post-Dobbs pendulum swing…)
Christians who think stuff like premarital sex or dressing a certain way or not being gay are really important to focus on and a really big deal to God need to consider reading the Bible. 🙄
A few years ago I wouldn’t consider these suits modest at all, but compared to all the other influencers who literally wear thong bikinis and post pictures of their entire asses out, they are modest
This sub really needs to let the Madi hate go. She’s not even involved in BN anymore this is getting old
[removed]
I love her she is a stunning woman. Very stunning.
Why don’t you all just start a Madi snark sub? There’s a lot of misogyny baked into the comments about her recently
This is a very niche reference but it kinda reminds me of Brittany Dawn. Another evangelical Christian influencer. She’s always virtue signaling about her “modesty” and how to dress to be a “good Christian”, when she regularly doesn’t even follow her own guidelines she tells other women they should follow.  The girlies on her snark sub are always dragging her for her blatant hypocrisy 😭
> It just doesn't align with what she's preaching at all.  Sums up most Evangelical Christians
I actually agree with this. That’s why I laugh when people say she’s fundie, because true fundies wouldn’t actually dress the way she does
That was kinda my reaction lol. It's not like she doesn't wear bikinis/short shorts/crop tops. It's all just marketing.
Omggg yesss. I was adamant to the youth pastor that if girls had to cover up with tshirts, then the guys would have to as well. 😉
I hated having to wear a stupid shirt in the pool at church camp 😑
I’m honestly confused about what she thinks about this suit is modest? It’s a bikini with a high thigh. I’d need a Brazilian wax for that. Is it literally just that it’s not a technical string bikini? I don’t get it.
I’m a 34c and would be POURING out of this
Hahaha I’ve got D’s and this is so accurate
THIS! I can’t look modest in anything bc of my curves. It’s either look “promiscuous” or look fat bc my boobs make anything not tight fitting look like I’m huge. Also I remember growing up in church and one of the elders told my youth minister to talk to me about a picture I posted in a bathing suit at the beach bc my boobs were showing lol like if I didn’t have big boobs that wouldn’t be an issue (my youth minister was cool btw and thought that it was sexist af too)
None of this is even modest on her, let alone anyone curvier. They're showing as much skin as most bikinis.
Hahahahha I’m cackling
And no cleavage on Madi. I 100% would have cleavage in that top.
It’s easy to have no cleavage when you have very small boobs. I’m sure this suit would not be considered “modest” on many other women.
No cleavage and no thong bottoms I’m assuming but yeah I agree
Thank you for verbalizing the issue I had with this. You know, in addition to all of the other issues I had with it.
Jesus wouldn’t even get wet as he walked on water. Terrible USP.
fun fact - Madi only models the front view of any of the Cupshe suits she is pictured in.
Idk if it's just photoshop or what but that pic of the bikini bottoms seems like it's close to being indecent lol
These are actually so cute
This is so cute, thank you for sharing! I prefer swimsuits with sleeves so this is great.
I have a couple from her line and they truly are sexy, classy, and timeless..love you Jojo!
I love this bikini! But is that Jojo pictured? Doesn't even look like her.
Shut up and take my money.
omg you are deliciously wicked
seriously, jesus walked on water. he never swam. so why would he care about swim suits? /s
I’ve been team Barb for awhile, she saw right through the judgmental fake Christian bs
I’m sorry your mom is such an asshole
Ugh, I feel this so deeply. I hope you don’t hear her voice in your head anymore! I still really struggle with this (“stop wearing that crossbody purse, it draws attention”).
I'm very curvy like size 6 but hourglass with boobs. And one time I was at a funeral wearing a skirt above my knee (slightly) and a lady kept throwing a blanket on me. DURING A FUNERAL. By the way, I was 15 with my mom supporting her because her nephew died.  So yeah, this modesty culture needs to stop. It makes people feel shameful about their bodies.
Agreed.  She was probably always small but I think she lost weight since she did have boobs on the show (from Sharleen's blog:  [madisoncream.png (533×337) (squarespace-cdn.com)](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5330ff05e4b019aa670599d3/1581148997075-W4G5UDWS8M10ECJHW8YY/madisoncream.png?format=750w) ) whereas here it looks - not to be creepy - like there's nothing to even push up.
Your mother reminds me of mine 🙃 because same
It’s just a buzzword for her conservative base that her books are marketed toward 🙃
Exactly. There's nothing particularly modest about these suits.
I mean It’s definitely some unique marketing to say the least.
That’s the boobed person’s fault obviously /s
exactly! apparently, you can only dress modest when you have thin privilege
That just made me think of something my friend told me about her days at a very Christian college once.  The young women weren't allowed to come to class with their hair wet because it would make the young men imagine them in the shower.   It's funny how much damage women can do just by existing in the bodies we were born in.
Right?!! I remember back in my church days a girl wore a tankini that showed maybe 3 inches of midriff and that was just SCANDALOUS. 😅
She and her roommate did a youtube video a while back about like confidence and dressing "modestly" but acknowledged in the video they still wear crop tops and bikinis etc so it was a bit unclear what their point was. I feel like dressing immodestly for them is just anything that falls under whatever they consider "trashy."
Omfg hahahah
excuse me but you forgot her third personality trait: wedding
Literally none of these are modest. The only thing is they’re not thong bikinis   I guess for her not a thong bikini = modest
Yup, some of the very conservative Christian girls I know would never wear tank tops with spaghetti straps or low necklines or short skirts or dresses or two piece bathing suits. Madi wears those things all the time.   By conservative Christian standards Madi isn't modest at all. And that's fine, she can wear whatever she likes, but using religion to sell bathing suits that aren't any different than regular bathing suits? It's weird.
She 100% had to have someone other than her husband wax her nether regions to make that 2 piece presentable. I’m not super Christian but that bikini bottom is *way* more crotch than I would feel comfortable showing the world!
Lol yeah my church made every girl wear a huge tshirt over *any* bathing suit
Churning out thousands of swimsuits in days to sell at dirt cheap prices is what Jesus advocated for, right?
This. Let’s see if i put MY tits and ass in those designs, I wouldn’t cause a man’s “eye to wander” or whatever. What a weird marketing gimmick
Considering that was originally what modest was supposed to be about but nooo it just got stolen to oppress women.
She knows. It's all bullshit for money
I was thinking that, what’s specifically modest about them? I don’t see it. There’s no extra coverage than a regular swimsuit.
Now now, she's saved tons of little African children by posting their pictures on Instagram without their consent.

Thank you. Like come out with a rash guard and swim shorts and I’ll buy modesty is your top priority lol
The people at pentecostal bible camp who made us swim in tshirts and umbro shorts would like a word
Well said!! Not to mention taking away from actual artists and brands who would love a following like Madi. Madi can put out some cheap shit claiming it’s Christian approved and she gets tons of money. I want to see actual people who deserve the recognition get the money!!
There is no way in hell she can sell her brand of being stick thin and moderately pretty while wearing an actually modest garment lmaooo. And the gag is, as a Jewish woman, I know pleeeenty of women that would love a new bathing suit at a good price. if she was smart she would ditch the Christian branding and market real long sleeve swimwear and bathing suits with skirts at an affordable price point but that wouldn’t be what Jesus wanted
Yeah there’s no modest bathing suit for me. At all. Ever. My body is the kind that gets sexualized no matter what I’m wearing and as a teen my body got me sent home from youth group because adults were sexualizing me.
What the fuck does that look like wet?
This is horrible
I just want to know what these sleeves look like after you’ve gotten in the pool
Gahhh my phone won’t load a picture!! I wanna see the ugly suit LOL
Oooof… this looks like a sexy baptism gown 💀
Seriously! I really hate this narrative about what bathing suits are  "appropriate" or not.   Skinny people who don't have curves have a world options to be as covered as they want to me.  Someone like me with an hourglass shape, thick thighs and a booty is going to look bootylicious and "sexy" whether it's a one piece, two piece, tankini whatever. My ass will swallow up whatever's in its path.  Just because I'm in a swim suit doesn't mean I'm dressing too revealing or not appropriate for family functions, being out in public etc.  It's A SWIMSUIT you're wearing next to nothing. It's going to hug your skin. That is the literal point.  People like her need to stop demeaning and "othering" people's bodies
agree.. like how is this not just a normal bathing suit?? im confused
 Seriously, like……..
LL bean and Lands End forever lol
Or REI lol
Google search burkinis
It’s hilarious like, madi and her bf (oops I mean husband lol) would get to heavens gate and get booted straight to hell cause they’re so fucking money hungry. Funny how “Christians” never follow the whole no riches thing.
Exactly! Maybe god should have made less obscene versions of our bodies
This is so niche. Kudos to you! 😜👏
It is a point of pride for me that my life guarding in string bikinis resulted in updates to the staff agreement that staff members always be “dressed appropriately”.  Guess what, I’m almost 40 now, and my cheeks are out now more than ever.  I have learned nothing.
Jesus loves you in your birthday suit too.
I thought the opposite, I feel like she makes Grant her personality. That and exploiting her "popularity" to make profit as an influencer. It's all GRANT GRANT GRANT ughhhh
“From His Rib” would work too
I prefer the cookbook “To Serve Man.”
Don’t give her any ideas!
I am so confused looking at the photos like…where is the “modesty”?? Is it just that it’s not a *string* bikini? Is there a rule in the Bible that your shoulder skin needs to have at least a half inch of coverage? 🤣
I laughed at this, so I say this light-heartedly, but honestly. I dislike Madi and Barb for different reasons, but at the same intensity.
I kind of want a season of Amazing Race where she and Madi are on the same team
The great part about making up all the rules is you can always re-make them in a way that makes slightly more money at the time
LMFAOO
Now I’m looking at my high waisted bikini briefs like ah shit does this make me look like a long lost Duggar kid?
I think they just needed a backstory to sell swimsuits
They absolutely can be, like the full arm/leg length ones some muslim women wear. It's just odd here because these are totally standard cuts that are available literally anywhere...
Hahaha YAAAAS
Or more like Amber Gemstone
Madi aka Ofgrant  Edit: Nevermind. She’s a wife not a handmaid, what am I even saying.
IM CRYING
I think “modesty” is another way to belittle/demonize women who are naturally curvy (think Kim k pre surgery, Meg Thee stallion, etc). Also it’s another way to blame women for men’s actions. 🙄
Exactly. Would they really consider these swimsuits modest on women with larger chests? Nope
Oh girl. I see you. The amount of times my body was deemed “inappropriate” for wearing perfectly average cut tops or bathing suits when I was younger is tooooooooo many. My petite sister and best friend were apparently perfectly appropriate in literal string bikini tops, whilst I had to put a t-shirt over my swimsuit top which was cut exactly like a sports bra )thick wide shoulder straps, thick wide bottom, lots of side and back coverage. I had boobs, that was my crime.
Right? I’m busty and curvy and these would look obscene on me.
Oh your church didn’t make every single girl wear a huge tshirt over their bathing suits no matter what?
The gif that keeps on giving
I hope it does. I’m a Christian and people like her make me sick.
Wow you’re right!
Yep. It’s so gross
Because shilling religion is what makes the sell to these white evangelicals.
😂
Jesus told her?
Allow me to let you in on some other hypocrisies related to religion.
That looks exactly like any other swimwear.... Nothing about her style is modest...
You can see Jesus in the swimsuit?
This made me think, imagine if madi and Luke P met on paradise…
*immediately saves this meme*
I’d never heard of modest swimwear until someone shares Josh and Anna’s (Duggar) honeymoon. This (me watching) was after he’d cheated on her, mind you. And I thought. Yep, modesty and purity. Worked for them!  It all just feels like a way to judge and shame women, while the men are given excuses and let off the hook. Pass.  Cover up what YOU want. Don’t let someone else tell you what to cover up.  Edit: To be clear, I think this modesty crap is bullshit. If you want to cover up, cover up. It doesn’t make you better than women who aren’t covered. And it doesn’t make you safer, and won’t make you find a better partner. You simply will be more covered. And people less covered aren’t worse humans.   The Duggars are full shitty humans, and Josh is a pedophile who cheated on his wife multiple times and physically assaulted a sex worker. He praises this crap. And Anna thought she was getting a better husband doing this. She didn’t. Wear what you want. But shitty people still are shitty. And Madi is judgmental and looking to profit off of shame.
yeah I was gonna that no modest-dress tradition that I'm familiar with would consider these swimsuits modest. Most of the dresses wouldn't count as modest either. But then I realized how silly it is to be sitting here splitting hairs over what counts as "modest" anyways...
This was my first thought 😂
Dittooooooooo.
For real. She’s the poster child for self absorption and conspicuous consumption.
Where the fuck is her PR?! Lol that was the worst sentence I’ve ever read!!
Holy capacitación, I thought you were trolling until I checked...
Yeah if I tried to wrangle my melons into any of those v tops it’d be titty city and Jesus would be real proud of his work.
Thank you for the context. This is small titty privilege more than anything tbh
None of those outfits are particularly modest. They’re cute, but just look like normal swimsuits and dresses to me.
Well, obviously your boobs are a sin. 😉
![gif](giphy|1oCv3ytUXFFyT7EYAN|downsized)
Those bikini bottoms are definitely not “modest” on anyone. They’re showing more skin in the front than the standard ones and I am a size 4 with an A cup.
I saw a person who had their wedding gown fitted and she was upset because it showed too much chest and she wanted to be more modest because of her faith- but in all honesty she had a larger chest which there is nothing she can do about and with out wearing a neck high shirt everyday of your life people will see cleavage because that’s just what your body is. Modesty is honestly so so annoying as a concept because it doesn’t make any sense to me
Even for trendy bikinis from Cupshe, this isn't particularly modest....
You know we're skyclad only
Very Christian! Jesus prob hocked budgie smugglers too.
Jesus’s top priority is to make sure women are being modest, so he’s 100% cool with it.
What do you mean why? To become a rich “Christian” grifter
She said god told her to. Prob because Luke p
She will be entering heaven through a heart cutout in her bikini. So bless you for not knowing Jesus satisfies.
C’s are the size most people request for implants and considered perfect size. So you are very lucky.  That said…. I was thinking that the bottoms in the bikini she’s modeling in the article are pretty skimpy cut (AKA, if you can see pelvic areas that would need to be shaved in order to wear it lol.) It’s not a string bikini, but it’s definitely not the standard cut, right?
But she’s so genuine and real
I can’t believe you don’t know it’s only Christian to be sizes 00-2!!! /s
Omg throw back!!!!!!
She could have, but from a begrudgingly cynical POV, it’s actually smarter marketing to do it this way… plus I can just imagine some 8th grade homeschooler convincing her parents to buy her first bikini because it’s from a “modest” and explicitly “Christian” line.
Yeah. This sudden fanatical adherence to the strictest evangelical standards is all for money. She wants that sweet sweet purity culture paper, and she's raking it in hand over fist. She's nothing but a cheap shill. It's especially scummy considering how damaging purity culture is to young women. I have nothing but contempt for her and other similar "religious" influencers
Yes
Because God is love. Duh
Omg I thought Madi said this🫣😅
😂😂
The one w the Walmart-esque hearts - if you’re promoting a modest line I wouldn’t expect to know how much you’re shaving  This is insane
The bikini is not even modest. She just had to use religion to boost sales, like Jesus wanted, I guess. Can anyone remind me what Jesus said about rich people? 🤔
Lol she’s turning into a diet version of those scummy televangelists
Yeah, I can now sorta understand why Barb lost her shit that night. This is also one time that Nick was right about someone too.
#JusticeforSweetnums
Some of us said it at the time, but no-one wanted to hear it! That girl gives me the goddamn CREEPS.
She’s so overly curated. Fembot energy. It’s weird.
This part screamed “I made my wedding my personality so now I’m having an identity crisis & don’t know what else to talk about” to me
I’m just imagining me with my huge boobs wearing this exact top. Would NOT be considered modest.
Does this bikini honor god?
> “But I still feel that that still appreciate the modest approach”  I felt like I was having a stroke when I read this part
I’m so ashamed of fellow Christian’s defending the Trizzy Troutt’s. They are nothing more than opportunists and scammers using Jesus’ name to make a quick buck. They fly in the face of everything that the gospel stands for
Hahaha. You are spot on and made me lol

This made me laugh!! I wonder what a Jewish swimsuit looks like?! 🤔😂
Wow! You should be the one writing books, not Madison. Very interesting and eloquently said
👏👏
Je$u$
The images in the article look like regular ass bikinis and one pieces lol
grew up evangelical and once on a church trip I got in trouble for wearing a two piece swimsuit (high-waisted bottom, full coverage bandeau top) but one of the other girls had a sheer white monokini that covered far less but it was a one piece so 🤷🏽‍♀️ 15 years later the modesty culture paired with the legalism still gets me so mad.
I grew up Evangelical and I was not allowed to wear 2 pieces, even tankinis that covered everything because it’s the idea of a two piece. Can you guess how I dress now?
I went to Christian church camps every summer in California during elementary school and no. None of us had even gone through puberty like we didn’t even like boys and I’m pretty sure they didn’t like us either. We were too young to have those feelings.  We wore one pieces with a t shirt over it. It’s crazy I was made to feel inappropriate or uncomfortable otherwise. It was just the norm and never really thought to question it back then
wow that’s really bad :/
I mean that’s just a reality for most thin women who don’t have a magic metabolism. I think it’s actually a good thing other than the opposite where they pretend to eat pizza everyday like Bella Hadid lol
https://meaww.com/amp/how-satan-interfered-in-the-bachelor-star-madi-and-grant-troutts-relationship  Because Satan is trying to make them stop f***ing (idk if I can curse on this sub)
![gif](giphy|Q7ozWVYCR0nyW2rvPW)
no literally what is going on. I don't think the Jesus that Maddie believes in would like this
As another fellow Christian, I do approve yours.
Imagine getting those sleeves wet
Riptides are closed circuits, so if you get caught in one, you will usually ride it back to shore. They also rarely go far, but more and heavier clothing can make it more difficult to swim back if you either don’t get the diffuse or swim parallel to get out of the current. And of course, if you panic and try to fight it, you’ll tire that much more quickly
Link?
I agree and I also don’t keep up with Tia, but I do think there’s a difference when an influencer preaches about loving others, caring for others, essentially following Jesus’s word and then being hypocritical through actions, does that make sense? Again I don’t keep up w Tia so idk if she has made a show of being “a good person” the way madi has
This model's waist is giving me like Barbie levels of uncanny valley proportions.

Bikinis
Especially cause her season was 2019/2020… how are brands still wanting to work with her?
That’s the funny part about the whole thing: the swimsuit isn’t even modest. It’s just a bikini 😂
Except they’re just normal bikinis
A bikini + short boardies might work? Idk if they still sell them at surf shops, maybe it was a 90s/00s thing.
Same but skinny Madi wearing a bikini isn’t it sadly
Check out Modli swimwear. I think it’s what you’re looking for.
It’s the off-season, we need something to talk about!
Recession babe
It’s a trend you should be wary about
Idk but if you figure out how to change your algorithm please let me know. I'm a 40 yo atheist witch and I'm tired of being recommended 20 something christian girls wedding content 😒
One data point: I don’t follow BN people and I have never seen any modest dress videos on my FYP
Ok but the rest of us normals have plenty of options for full coverage swimwear, influencers aren’t the end-all source for what clothing is out there.
Hers are no more modest than a standard swimsuit you can pick up anywhere
You’re right but that has nothing to do with Jesus or you shaming someone wearing them  You just prefer something different and can go find it. By the way I feel the same way and love Andie ones
Yeah. I want a bikini, but I want full coverage bottoms that cover my whole butt cheeks. It’s surprisingly difficult to find cute full coverage bottoms.
True! I like a more high coverage bathing suit too. But I also don’t view people in thong bikinis or people on topless beaches as less moral than me.
Agree! Nothing to do with religion but I hate how revealing current trendy swimsuits are. I have so much anxiety swimsuit shopping now. I have to order online to even find something that remotely covers my butt/crotch area
Yeah. It’s hard for me to find ones that make me comfortable. If she can actually design some that are trendy, well made and not super skimpy I am on board. It’s not a radical concept for swimwear but i would look at them
Literally bc she has small/no boobs. Did you see the whole lot of ass in the back for the other women who modeled the suits?
Bc she doesn’t have big boobs. Anyone with larger boobs would have cleavage in this
Depends what you compare them to and also depends on the idea of modesty of the person comparing them.
No it’s fun 🙃
This comment is a no from me
I’m very Christian and can say with what we’ve allowed as the representation and loudest voices of our religion and the harm they actively cause, we’ve earned any ridicule  If more Christians would ridicule this dangerous wing of the religion that continues to dominate, the world would be better off
I cannot speak to hate on this sub in general, but if you read through some of the comments here you will see a theme of: hypocrisy, judgement, and using religion as a sales gimmick.  What’s more Christian:  A) Shilling fast fashion “modest” bathing suits to honor God, therefore implying that bathing suits are inherently immodest? Any person outside of Madi’s body type would not be deemed “modest” if they were wearing the same garments  B) Not using your faith to sell to your young female audience. Not working with a fast fashion company with problematic practices such as IP theft, child and underpaid labor  🤷🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️
Correct me if I’m wrong but the comments ridiculing evangelical Christianity pushing puritanical beliefs are typically coming from people who grew up in or around a toxic Christian culture (myself included) so basically, the call is coming from inside the house 😂
it's the purity culture the sub laughs at (which should be laughed at), not Christianity as a whole
I’m Christian and I find madi’s behavior really gross and sad. What she is doing is not “in Jesus’s name”.
LMFAO what? Nobody hates Christians, we hate when Christians use their religion as an excuse for being a shitty person.  In this case, all we’re saying is that it’s weird to use Jesus to scam…I mean, sell, “modest” swimwear.
![gif](giphy|3o7TKzyWlCxCQ5R8fm|downsized)
BFFR.   99% of Bach contestants that talk regularly about their religion are Christians. I don’t see anyone who identifies as Muslim, Buddhist or even catholic going on about how their religion influenced them before, during or after being on the show. Only the Christians do that. I’m ex-Christian and the blatant, careless, harmful hypocrisy of that religion is what drove me from it.
Right??? Imagine these comments being made about a Muslim women promoting a hijab or a Jewish woman promoting a wig or head scarf 🥴 everyone can define their own modesty, and why are people acting like influencers don’t ALL promote things to make money?? That’s their job! They work in sales!
What other religions do this hypocritical, scammy shit and oppress us in America? I'm sure not all, but Christians need to address these problems internally.
So genuine and real
Why do you only comment about madi it’s very weird
There’s a lot of misogyny in the evangelical Christian narrative she’s pushing so I’m gonna keep on keeping on
I think they already did…but it’s still here too
Ugh Brittany dawn is a terrible human and hypocrite
She deserves to be dragged lmao. She's being sued by the state is Texas for scamming people. 🤷‍♀️
Rules for thee, not for me
Even the one-piece has a little keyhole cutout. If your entire thing is that the bathing suits are more modest than the average swimwear, it's weird to just design a normal-ass suit that you could find at Target.
Found my big boob girls! Double Ds checking in!  Literally anything my best friend wears looks fine because she has As but when I wear the same thing, we always joke that I’m super “slutty.”
Oh, yeah. Same.
It's impossible for me to have cleavage so I guess anything I wear must be super modest even if it's just nipple pasties by Madi's definition lol.
How are her clothing choices modest if she can’t show her backside wearing them?
Yes there was no way Madi and Peter would have worked out. He was in love with the idea of her but they were both totally not compatible and now I understand why his family (although they could have handled it better) were so adamant about it. #justiceforsweetnums
Eh barb is MAGA so I’m not sure she minds the fake Christian bs. But she was right that they weren’t compatible.
Thank you! She has majorly body shamed me my entire life (and fat shamed me A LOT growing-up to the point that I still don't let her see me in a bathing suit). It is what it is.
Thank you! I'm sorry you can relate. My mom still talks about her weight ALL THE TIME whenever I am around her and it's so annoying. (She's 100lbs! She's 100lbs! Did you know she's only 100lbs?) She stays skinny with a diet of cigarettes and vodka, has recently had to have ALL her teeth pulled because she didn't take care of herself and talks about a size 4 like it's plus-sized!
Naturally.
Those poor *poor* men! How dare the women practice personal hygiene. 😒  I never would have lasted in a place like that, college was challenging enough without worrying about scaring men into thinking I could dare to take showers naked.
But like what if it rains? Then what will the poor men do?
I can get a more modest swimsuit at bucees
lol. yea it's just a cash grab - I'm sure she has plenty of followers that will shop this line - she's laughing all the way to the bank.
She’s clearly trying to stay on “brand” even when it makes no complete sense 😂
Yeah seriously.. I just bought bikini bottoms from Victoria’s Secret that have more coverage than hers. No one who follows “modesty” would buy her stuff. She’s so full of herself for trying to justify her greedy behaviour by slapping the Christianity label on it
I'm assuming they aren't the a$$ floss style, but what do I know? Or care, TBH
She also called them dirty <3 so jesus-like
The same thing happened to me!!! The adults shamed me for the swimsuit my parents had approved of. My dad was pissed and told them I would wear it anyhow whenever we swam at Teen VBS week.
I have a sizable chest that still looks proportionate because I'm tall. I figure, I can wear a triangle bikini top. I purchased a L and um... I looked like a porn star. So I sent it back and ended up with an XXXL just for coverage. It's still pretty skimpy, but they don't really make wide triangle bikinis! That's what Madi should have invented.
Well said!! My body is similar to yours, but I also have a larger chest! ANY bathing suit I put on is going to show lots of cleavage or side boob. That’s just how it goes!!
It’s so weird too because they have a shit ton of money? Like they must be addicted to fame and attention, cause they could actually be doing something more meaningful
Yep. I think they need to go back and read the part of the Bible where Jesus flips the tables over because he’s pissed that people are treating the temple like a strip mall.
Who's that?
*gifing
She wore regular non-modest bikini's and clothing constantly on Peter's season lmfaoo she's such a fucking grifter.
Is he in the shower?
Lol wait can you really? lol it just looked like a white textured swimsuit to me 😂😂
Oh my god, it would have been hilarious...
You can’t convince me that she didn’t think he would be the Bachelor instead of Peter.
Right… because I assume the man can still wear his nice bathing suit that show me all that chest hair, those immodest knees and even sometimes some high thigh
I also have to agree with this. This would not have been modest enough for me to be allowed to wear as a pre-teen follower of Christ lol. The stuff I consumed actively judged anyone who was wearing a bikini. It’s so obvious she’s trying to pander to the hillsong type evangelical girls who want to say they’re being modest etc etc but actually aren’t
the way american christians, more specifically american christian men misconstrue modesty to be about women’s skin showing (specifically breasts) makes me infuriated every day. all of these men shame women every day for sinning simply by existing in their god given bodies, and then turn around and do truly devious unchrist-like shit.
My new swimsuit is sunscreen!
That’s why he put it in the 10 commandments!
![gif](giphy|dLsaNNt8DbrbLPhY2F|downsized)
Jesus wasn’t plus sized, so…
Agree that it’s smarter to market it that way. Also she’s made it her identity. That’s also why she’s so unlikeable.
I thought they made love in the face of the devil, not God. Idk honestly they’re too kinky for me
Not that much of a stretch. I’m sure Madi had opinions about the whole Alexis Morris-Caitlin Clark thing and I can guess what those opinions were.
Not publicly lmao
it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God
I thought Barb was insane the first time I saw that episode but now I agree with her more and more lol
I see this perspective so easily.
I’m not sure about what’s going on in the world but wow!!!!  This take on swimsuits is just unnecessary. A swimsuit is a swimsuit! If you don’t want to wear a swimsuit, wear a coverup. Better yet, a conservative one piece.
Because they are. She probably just wanted to make a bikini line but belongs to the super Christian community and slapped “modest” on them to appeal to and appease the people who follow her. Religious ppl are usually selective about what’s “moral” when it works in their favor
First of all I am so sorry you had to go through that. It sounds like such a dumb thing to focus on, tbh. And once again, I am baffled because I grew up catholic in the epicentre of Catholicism and thus was never an issue 😵
I hope you have a wardrobe full of bikinis to show off anytime you want 🤗  Ps. That's ridiculous.
Yikes

I agree, definitely not as much hypocrisy with Tia and I like her! But the comments there were literally praising her for partnering with Abercrombie which is hypocritical imo. I understand this sub isn’t a monolith but when nobody calls it out for her but there’s 50 comments ready to call it out for Madi within an hour that does give me pause, we shouldn’t be using very serious issues that actually kill people to only criticize people we don’t like.

Are these swimsuits from her line? Tell me they aren’t please…

Recession should mean less fabric, not more!
Ughhhhh. I knew purity culture was on its way back…
On the other hand, I would joyfully purchase a swimwear line that aligns with your 40 yo atheist witch values.
I actually saw more of the line after commenting (someone posted a link), and while the bottoms are a bit more full coverage, the tops and dresses are mostly v-neck, which doesn’t really help someone with large breasts if they’re wanting more coverage. So I kinda agree w you. If you’re gonna create a line based on “modesty” then it should be for everyone, not just those who would look “modest” in anything bc they have small boobs
If you go on BIP, they’ll paint them on for you!
I like J. Crew’s swim bottoms. My favorite style was their Italian matte bikini bottom. I think you can find them on eBay/Poshmark now. But it was classic without feeling dowdy.
Those garments are directly connected to their respective religions/cultures. Bikinis are not related to Christianity in any way and the suits in the article aren't even modest compared to other standard swimwear, so using her religion as a promotional tool in this case comes across as exploitative. She's using her faith as a tool to profit off something that has absolutely nothing to do with her faith.  If Ariel was using her Jewish heritage to promote a line of plain white bikinis, people would side-eye that too.
I mean agreed, but why does that excuse people here from their pwn misogynistic comments?
Those single-focus “snark” subs that almost exclusively target women are cess pools.
I wasn’t implying that she didn’t. Her snark Reddit is one of my favorites. She’s the worst🤎
Target is higher quality than Cupshe, the brand she designed for.
That is actually an excellent point
Yeah I’d say more liberal Christians generally notice the fake Christian bs more but I do think Barb saw right through her
Jealous that you are busty and she isn't, maybe?  Very sad.
The women are clearly required to stay home if it rains, because they can't risk getting their hair wet and tempting the men, OBVIOUSLY.
I saw a TikTok about how Skims sells more legit modest swimwear and they weren’t wrong
calling them filthy and broken🙏🏻😩 seems exactly like something Jesus, the man who hung out with lepers and prostitutes, would do
For real??
Omg this!!! Also, did you have weird experiences at camp where you might go to hug the pastor because you’re a kid and you’re innocent and they insist on a side hug as if we had the plague? I swear they were all sexualizing us kids.
Yeah like literally if heaven exists, god already said y’all rich motherfuckers can’t get in ever. Just goes to show how full of shit they are.
The wife of Danny McBride’s character in The Righteous Gemstones. If you have HBO Max (or any other way to stream it), I HIGHLY recommend.

I was kidding but I wouldn’t put it past her to try to convince people Jesus was in the swimsuit
You sure you’re not talking about Muslim men here?
thank you and i’m glad you avoided it!  it’s amazing to me how different sects of christianity can vary so wildly.
It’s just bottoms, I throw bikini tops away.
Blatant rip-off. Look at the heart placement
I love that they’re called “tease bottoms.” Feels very apropos for a Madi-run modesty Christian shame scam.
They aren’t. The stuff from her actual collection will say xMadison in the pictures, if you put shop the collection, it shows you her stuff first, and then it goes into all the other cupshe items available.   Notice how the second photo says cupshexstassie

> the top comment on this post says “this what’s wrong with all Christians”  I just did a search for the words "all Christians" in this thread and the only place I found that phrase was in your comments.
Agree, that is a sweeping generalization. Unfortunately there are many people in this world that use religion (not just Christianity) to harm, control and manipulate. There are many people in this world that have been harmed by religious oppression, homophobia, purity culture, etc. if you can’t tell the hurt and disgust by those impacted is palpable.  As a nation we are at a critical point in which a political party is predominantly following Christian “values” and women, lgbtq+ and children are the recipients of great harm. So when you ask that question in a sub where most of the audience is female…welp.  ABC/the bachelor is a franchise that caters to Christian and “family” values, and it’s often pushed on the audience. The exec that was just ousted was part of this system and was outed as racist among other things.   Long winded way of saying…a former bachelor contestant who went on the show just to turn the bachelor down to build a Christian fan base to sell shitty goods…it’s just not gonna go over with this Reddit audience well.
baby I guarantee you that no one is insulting “every single christian”.   If you feel offended when people call out racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, hypocritical, for-profit Christians, maybe you’re just all of those things…
So why suggest it!? The only one harming women is Madi, and we will keep calling it out. Cry for the billionaires elsewhere. You don't get a pass for being a misogynistic scam artist just because you yourself are a woman. 🙄
Same here haha!
Sorry, she actually said filthy https://www.reddit.com/r/thebachelor/comments/enbrpl/madi_and_nicaraguan_children/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1   Edit to add: the Instagram post is deleted now
tbh i’m speaking on what i know, islam is not a faith i ever practiced so i don’t have any experience to base my criticism around!
I talk shit on Christian’s cause they screwed me up growing up and they’re currently destroying the country I live in. I leave the other religious criticism to those who are from the faith or living in countries where they’re dealing with the oppression.
Is there a difference?
EVEN BETTER!
It was a rhetorical suggestion intended to point out that the volume of posts and comments mocking everything this one specific woman does belong in those misogynistic, obsessive “snark” groups. You can call out the hypocrisy and harm of evangelical Christianity without dehumanizing and demeaning one young woman, who in my opinion is also a victim of that harmful cult. I understand the argument that she’s promoting these norms to her followers, but I’ve seen a lot of comments that go beyond that and seem to project a lot of hostility onto her, which should likely be instead directed to the clique of “cool” Christian girls from when they where in 8th grade.   With that said, this post and the comments actually weren’t so bad.
Read the news and see what’s happening in Islamic countries to women who simply want to show their hair and you’ll get a real good idea soon👍
Exactly. American evangelical Christianity influenced my life for many many years, Islam has not. I have personal experience with Christianity and specifically it’s negative aspects therefore I feel comfortable speaking on it. I’m not sure why it is a bad thing to that person who replied that I don’t want to speak on and criticize an entire group of people based on their religion when I have not studied said religion!
Where is this comment because I can’t see it
And is the top comment on this post saying “this is what’s wrong with all Christians” in the room with us?  https://preview.redd.it/9h0inytzeyra1.jpeg?width=1290&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2da97cace9eb5b1df43062a18d48c0d6a20b58f8
If it's not about you then continue on with your day knowing you're right with your god. Isn't that supposed to be what's important? It's not like Christianity is oppressed in this country, it's one of the most powerful legislative and cultural forces here. People are punching up at a power structure that's attempting to - and in many instances currently succeeding to - control their lives against their will and in violation of their own personal beliefs. Madi and her husband's family are critical parts of this power structure.
i’m aware of what is currently going on, but again i don’t personally practice the religion so it’s really not for me to say that muslim men can be likened to american christian men wether they live in iran or not.   my comment doesn’t refer to the iranian government or anything to do with islam and in my opinion selling modest bikinis under the guise of evangelical christianity is completely different to what is going on in iran.   i am criticizing a sect of religion that has personally harmed me and you are talking about freedom of religion under an extremely oppressive and violent government, and while i’m not denying the horrors that are going on over there in the name of religion, i really feel like we’re talking about two completely different things
How about look at American politics and see what Christian men are doing to women? Islamic men haven't done anything to me.
From your comments I can clearly tell you don’t practice Christianity so not sure why you think you don’t have a right to speak on Muslim people when you don’t practice it but have a right to speak on Christians. Muslims and Christians both exist in America and unless your extremely sheltered and never come across a Muslim person then not sure what your point is. I am certain you’ve come across people of all sorts of religions.
What an individualistic and selfish way of looking at things, good lord. Strong “They haven’t done anything to me so why should I care” mentality here.
Her hair and eyes are just 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
Underrated beauty. This is such an exciting year for her!
Becca is so gorgeous. I can’t wait to see her wedding and reception looks!
She really has a very nice set of teeth 👌
If anyone ever calls me a butte😂  ![gif](giphy|3ov9jFKLJXQZGdcvBu|downsized)
She’s so pretty! And Thomas is always grabbing that booty. I would too my guy. 🙌
Becca is so beautiful. I have such a crush on her. #biqueen  I am bi. I know she's not :) But still, Becca appreciation!  Her and Thomas are the best! I love him for her! 🥰
She really is superhuman levels of gorgeous
In my mind, she is THE bachelorette
So gorg. Happy Belated Birthday to this smokeshow 🥳
Girls from MN are just *chefs kiss*
My good friend dated her for a month or so pre 'Bachelor.' She hit him up after the initial breakup but he was engaged
Imagine being that photogenic!!
This woman is magnificent. Very beautiful and photogenic.
I noticed it was both Becca and Andi’s birthday. Also Blake’s girlfriend Giannina also had a birthday yesterday And Trista’s daughter.
I watched Katie’s season but missed BIP when Thomas and some of Katie’s other guys were on. Did they ever resolve the Thomas drama? IIRC, they all just accused Thomas of not being there for the right reasons, then Katie kinda roasted him at the rose ceremony. Was there ever anything else that came out about that?
I thought she was older than 33! Her season seems so long ago
One of the most stunning women I have ever seen ever
Happy Birthday, Becca! I think she’s one of the most beautiful/gorgeous humans I’ve ever seen - never seen a bad picture of her.
She's gorgeous!
Becca kinda looks like a Blue-eyed Ariel lol
Haven’t been keeping up the past few years - she’s with the villain from Katie’s season? What’d I miss?
The cutest!
She looks like a model.
Beaut lol
Thanks 😊
What is she like? Any other tea?
Initial breakup as in after her breakup with garrett?
The guys and Katie apologized to him. The guys’ take on him stemmed from him saying yes he’d be the bachelor which is so dumb. There was nothing actually there but he and Becca are getting married this year so that’s where they’re at & leaving that petty sh*t in the past where it belongs
UO: I know Thomas redeemed himself on BIP and good for him and Becca but he WAS kinda shady on Katie's season, he said he was falling in love with her before even getting a 1 on 1. Like come on.
I just don’t think he was into Katy but truly fell for Beka.
She has beauty with an elegance. It’s a nice combination.
She and Thomas have been together since BIP 7, so coming up on two years now? They broke up at the end of their season but got back together very quickly off camera (I think they said they were talking again within a couple of days), she proposed about a year ago, they bought a house in San Diego together, he proposed back, and they’re one of five BIP couples getting married this year.
More than cute.  Beautiful.
That story sounds made up lol math not mathing  ![gif](giphy|3owzW5c1tPq63MPmWk|downsized)
No, like the original guy
Good for them! Actually, I do remember the question of being bachelor and thought it was foolish for any contestant to not think about potentially becoming the bachelor.
Interesting. Glad he got his redemption - suck it Aaron!
Arie?
Yeah
Idk if Ash Talks Bach is on here but she is wonderful. 🥰
I’ve been binge-listening to this podcast and really appreciated how they immediately called out Anastasia’s micro-aggressions when many people glossed over it.
The only side eye was not calling out Nick for his treatment of Zach and comparing to Kaitlyn who admitted she was tough and apologized privately to him.
I listened for Ashley. So good
I love this pod but can only listen in my car. The vocalfry is so jarring on my airpods.
She is!   (Both wonderful and on this episode!)
Agree completely. I like that they can be critical of the show when it’s appropriate, and still enjoy what’s good and fun about it
Yeah, Claire and Emma have been “friends” with him for a long time. It’s always awkward when a guest is openly critical of him and they sidestep it. It’s one of the few things that makes me really question their judgement.
They’re all fans of Nick. I think Claire and Emma might actually be friendly with him through Sharleen.
Yeah.  I think Nick gets away with way too much
Her commentary was FIRE.
Emma more so. Claire was tougher on him after Natalie “exposed” his texts with Katie. Wow, time really flies 😂
It’s so weird because he’s the exact kind of guy they usually go pretty hard (rightfully) on. So when they bring him up and there’s zero critique of him it is noticeable
Yeah I’m surprised Nick isn’t being called out more for the Zach thing. It’s not the fact that he bashed Zach… it’s the fact that he reached out to him to tell him he was gonna support him right before, just to do the opposite. Majorly two faced dick move
They’re like that with other men too. I remember they had such a bad take on Greg’s exit that they had to re-record their podcast because so many of their fans were mad. Then it turned out that Emma was friends with Greg and invited him to her holiday party.
EXACTLY.    I really have to wonder: has he always been this two-faced, or is this the effect of being involved with the franchise for so long? Or a side effect of a really close relationship with an influencer like Natalie (I mean, clout-chasing is the whole job)?    Is this part of why the men on Andi's season HATED him? And part of why Shawn hated him (I know Shawn had other good reasons). He was super calculated when he was the Bachelor. I think maybe the mask has just been slipping more as time has passed.  UGH.
i watched andi and kaitlyn‘s seasons live and yeah, he’s calculated and manipulative and has been for years. but he used to be more subtle about it.  to compare the bachelor to drag race, josh murray was the phi phi o’hara to nick’s roxxxy andrews on all stars 2 / BIP. both of them were there to redeem their images, but one had learned from their previous experiences and one hadn’t. nick coming off as a “girl’s guy” on that season was so calculated, but it paid off.  (and nick is nothing compared to roxxxy and josh murray can drink concrete)
I’m not feeling well mentally. Friday (which is Good Friday and April 7th) is the 11th anniversary of my brother’s (really traumatic, unexpected) death; he died on a Good Friday overnight between April 6 and April 7. I’ve got so much going on at work; I have a lot to do before I take off for a week to visit my aged parents across the country; and then when I get back, I have to go right into the conference I am presenting at. It’s still winter where I am and I’m depressed about that as well. I’m not sleeping well, and I don’t know if all of this is what’s making me feel so hopeless and full of despair, but I am hopeful that after Easter I will feel a lightening. I know that no one might ever see this; I just feel like (like I always do) there’s no one I can talk to about it. Years ago I tried to go to therapy and it just didn’t work out. Everyone I know who knew my brother, I would just be burdening them to bring it up. And people who never knew him, cannot understand
Having anxiety sucks since it affects my appetite. My weight fluctuates & people comment on it 😭 I am trying my best !!!!!!!!!
I went through the trenches and secured Taylor Swift tickets for my friends and I during presale but a friend and I had to sell ours for financial reasons. Now we have the ability to buy them and we are crossing our fingers for some luck 🤞🏽
Idk if I’m hormonal or reaching a low point, but I’ve been crying a ton the past week and have been triggered by things that I’m really sensitive to. Lately it’s been criticism and I hate that I’m so sensitive to it. I hate my brain and wish I could be a normal person who can just say “ok I’ll work on that” and not let it bother me, but for me, I feel like such a broken pos whenever I hear I’m not being the best version of myself and it’s really hard to snap out of it.
I have to buy all my groceries for passover dinner tomorrow night but I can't get to the store until after my lunchtime meeting. Here's hoping there's still brisket at one of my 2 grocery stores!
I’m going to Mexico soon and I’m so irritated at how everyone is like omg it’s so dangerous don’t go there!!! Like I’m going on a group trip, and then I’m going to an island that’s probably safer than where I live. Yet then I’ll be alone and anywhere I’d be a little nervous anyway, and now I just want to cancel the whole stupid trip because it’s more expensive than I planned too so I’m not even excited about any of it
Stevie Nicks got canceled. And I might get a refund (I got an insurance policy on the tickets) but Ticketmaster won’t give it to me because I bought them resale, so I’m hoping Vivid Seats will give me the refund instead of ticket vouchers because I could use the money for moving costs.   Bummed to miss out, but also hoping I don’t lose out on $500 either…
Im working from a coffee shop today and it astounds me the lack of self awareness ppl have. One dude is full on we-working almost yelling level on calls. Another dude tries to close the door to a private room without a reservation and gets pissy when someone tries to come in. I came for the jams playing, good coffee, ppl watching, eavesdropping juicy convos, and knocking down a to do list
I prob should be asking this in some wedding channel but i'm too early in planning and they stress me out. For the married people out there I'm curious what your wedding guest count was. I think mine is going to be 50 but it just seems so small idk. A wedding stresses me out because I don't have a core friend group, I just have random 1 on 1 friends from different periods of my life, so i don't know if everyone will mix well together plus my fiances hometown/college friends. Its times like these where I just want to elope.

Love is Blind reunion is gonna be live this time!
Go huskies!!!!!
The phillies are RUBBISH 😭😭😭😭😭
My dog ran away this morning (climbed under fence 🙄) and I spent an hour looking for him before taking my daughter to daycare and then when I got home (an hour or so later), I went back out and the little trickster was coming through the neighbor’s bushes, exhausted, like nothing happened.   He has run away 3x in the last week but usually goes right to my neighbor’s house so when he wasn’t there, I panicked a little. Oh well. He’s not allowed to go free range in our fenced backyard anymore lol
Got into a tiff with a coworker because she’s lied about things and I don’t know what the eff she’s doing work-wise.
I’ve become obsessed with this podcast and I want you all to listen.  I had NO clue how many times I’ve actually been cheated on… it’s a lot. A lot of things make sense now.   Anyway, I’m happily married and I can laugh about it all and cackle at the horrifying situations of their guests. Sometimes I cringe.   Y’all go love Lace and Katherine!   https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/cheaties-with-lace-larrabee-and-katherine-blanford/id1503079848
I feel you friend. I just lost both my parents to tragic accident 2 weeks ago. I'm not sure how to navigate this right now but just so you know I get what you are going through and even on a anonymous internet site, be assured that everyone is here for you when you need it. I received many kind messages and I hope you know that we may not know each other but much love your way no matter what.. Take care of yourself the best way you can.❤❤❤ And yes winter can piss off!!
Sending you love 💜 I hope it starts feeling like spring soon!
literally me 2 hours ago!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Thinking ✨briskety✨ thoughts. I'm just worried about finding enough blue bottle moscato!!  Also, manischewitz changed their macaroon packaging from the canisters to bags and it's the end of an era 😭
Same. But after work 😩
We drove down to Ensenada in February to go to wine country and it was the same, my boss was like omg no it’s so dangerous!!!! It was beautiful and we had such an amazing time.
Are you going to cozumel? I went to Mexico recently and it was amazing. If you’re going to a touristy area it will probably feel very safe because they take the tourism industry seriously and want you to have a great time. Especially in a group trip. If you’re going to remote areas alone then it would make sense to feel worried.
I had 15 guests! Lol. Do what makes you happy and don't worry about it. It's YOUR day. And congrats!!
I think in the end we had around 40 people. And I remember before the wedding thinking that it might be too small. But in the end, I had so much fun at my wedding. It was definitely one of the best days of my life-you get so caught up in the dancing and the fun and the love. Plus if your wedding is smaller, it gives you more time to mingle amongst your guests so it’s not so overwhelming.
Not married, but recently was a maid of honor for a 200+ person wedding (300 invited, maybe 230 came?) and following that experience, would want something much smaller for myself. Wedding planning is stressful enough as it is, why not curate your guest list to ONLY the people you want to celebrate with?   50 people you genuinely care about sounds like a LOVELY ceremony🫶🏼
Mine was around 100, which felt like a good amount. My side was mostly family (both parents come from huge families); since my spouse is from the opposite coast most of their side was college friends. It worked well, we knew our friends and families' personalities well enough that when we had to sit people together who didn't know each other, they all got along very well
Mine was about 80
We're inviting 70-ish but I think about 50-ish will actually be able to come.   Con:   -feeling a little insecure about not having a huge instagram perfect party wedding like we see on social media all the time  Pros:  -more intimate vibe  -less pressure on us as the center of attention  -more time to spend with all the guests  -smaller catering budget; alternatively, can offer more extravagant food when spending for less people  -can spend less $$ overall; alternatively, more flexibility in the budget for extras  -easier to get hotel blocks/coordinate travel necessities for less people  -guests can still mingle just fine, they're all adults and know how to act in social situations!  -it's actually really popular right now to have smaller weddings; so many people are choosing guest lists of 50 or less, so it's not abnormal at all  You're not alone in having these anxieties, I felt (still feel sometimes) the same way! But you still have people that love you and would love to celebrate with you, even if it's not a centralized group.
crying for my moms alma mater and my city’s team but uconn dominated the whole tourney!
LFGM 💙🧡💙🧡
You prob thought that last year then bam
I’m so glad he came back! My dad has an air tag on his dog’s collar and it’s so helpful in case of emergency
How old is your dog? That sounds stressful!
Thank you, and I am sorry for your (double) loss. 🖤🖤
Thank you 😊 and ditto. 💜
Sending you so many hugs!!!
Whoa really? I'll have to confirm if that change made it to my store!!  My mom is visiting my sister this year instead of coming to my place so this is the first year we're not splitting the prep work (I always do the brisket, potato kugel, matzo ball soup, and homemade matzah. She always does the charoset and dessert).
I was originally going to just go tomorrow morning since I'm taking the day off to cook and my mom was like "...... 😧"
Ugh so annoying haha but that’s great! I even actually know like 3 people who recently went to Mexico too. But anyone sees one bad thing and I should stay away from the whole country apparently. Although I have also had a lot of stress dreams now because I’m not excited about the getting around alone part. I just wanted to sit on a pretty beach like stop bothering me people haha
That’s awesome it was amazing! I’m going to Mexico City with a group then flying to Cancun on my own to stay on isla mujeres. Which is touristy, but also not one of top destinations so I figure less people trying to take advantage like may be in Cancun. I mainly picked it because there’s no seaweed problems hahah
I should definitely consider that. He’s been breaking out more as he’s gotten into his golden years
He’s 11 and getting a little senile. At least he knew how to get home
And please by any means don't think am I try to mitigate what is going on my life is worse. It's all shit. But just letting you know you are not alone and if you want to talk about something nobody else does, I'm here for you cause there are definitely things I have not talked about with my fam.
thank you 💛 hugs back 💛💛💛💛💛💛💛
Wow that is quite the menu, good luck cooking! Do you have a favorite kugel recipe to share? ♥️
They’re really cheap! If you’re an iPhone user, worth it
I usually use the one from the NY Times but I also add garlic
Manifesting us getting spoilers about who is left, FIR, Frontrunners, etc. SOON!  ![gif](giphy|lQ7geLKnnf7pIu7uAN|downsized)
Y’all I received even more tea about Aaron b. This guy is basically Clancy 2.0😭
Kind of frustrating that RS keeps talking about these photos but won’t post them because he can’t identify the guys. I feel like we all easily could lmao
Did u guys see what u/Subject-Realistic posted on her IG story👀 Are we even surprised? I knew he was sus when we found out he is friends with Aaron C.
RS got more pics from the date yesterday but it was mostly of crew and Jesse. Also the weathers been bad the entire time they’ve been there:( It’s hard to identify two guys in the photo because they’re covered up with the hoods of their jackets. Thinks he knows next location but isn’t sure, also said he heard about a future city location for this season but isn’t sure.
https://preview.redd.it/ukpmt7vi81sa1.jpeg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7ad008015aa843e12e0696b1cd2d4c0291da286b  Just found this photo someone posted from the lodge on twitter. Looks like Joey, maybe Sean?? (idk) and I wonder if that’s the back of Aaron B?  ETA: Wondering if the little bit of red on Joey is a rose? Maybe he got a one on one this week!
Looks like the set up for the rose ceremony lol  https://preview.redd.it/n53r0o2en1sa1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=848d16f899700092c0c9b3d3bd181b94909486dc  Found this on Instagram. Stevenson,WA ig Story
How much men should charity have left after tonight’s rose ceremony?
What rose ceremony are we on?
I've read about some videos from dates here, where can I find them?
Much like how all franchise Garretts are racist, all franchise Aarons have multiple girlfriends 💀
Manifesting Charity getting the ick and somehow cutting him immediately 😭
Aaron’s from San Diego on this show 🚩🚩🚩
And sadly I think he’s probably going to go very far
Utilize the free labor, Steve
Yeah it’s annoying. I’d rather he not mention he got photos if he’s not going to post them.
He just doesn’t want us to identify them because I think we all easily could. He wants to be the first😭
Ikr he also said he needed time to identify the Barbie date guys but we instantly got most of them😩
She’s really upset with the fact that he applied to go on the show while they were still together. Still seems pretty hurt about it.
I mean Aaron went on BIP with two girlfriends at home. I’m not shocked that one of his real life besties is also terrible to women.
This isn’t very surprising, especially because as you mentioned he’s friends with Aaron C. I’m not gonna take him seriously as a contender so hopefully Charity isn’t too into him.
aw, I feel for the woman but tbh at this point I always just assume that a handful of contestants each season (men and women, and even “likable” ones or people who end up falling for the lead) do something like this.
Lols not surprised. I personally don’t find him physically attractive (guess he’s not my type) but the fact that he was freakin’ Aaron “Fame Wh*re” Clancy’s BFF should have immediately made people not root for him. Hopefully he’s out by next week. I know he already got a 1:1 but he doesn’t need any more screen time and the last thing we need are some fans rooting for him and Charity and getting mad when she doesn’t pick him.
Is it really shocking that someone is there for clout? They all are 😂 I don’t have strong feelings one way or the other about Aaron B but this is such a non spoiler for me, and could apply to probably the whole cast.
No one actually  goes on this show specifically for love. They just have to actually be single & open to find love or someone IMO.
lols as someone who lives in Seattle, WA, I could have told them not to film in Washington state in March/April. The weather is precarious. They better not be messing up Ms. Charity's blowouts lol.
Do we know where they filmed?
Joey stocks going up 📈  He's definitely top 4 in my opinion unless something drastic happens.
 Oh good eye! Def think it's a rose so I think he either got a 1-1 or the GDR. Agreed about the guys too, Joey, Sean, & Aaron B.
This might be an easy guess at this point, but I wouldn't be surprised if Joey is in the F2. Not sure about F1 after that group date where he and the other guys said they hadn't kissed Charity yet. This is assuming that whoever got the FIR kissed her and it's another FIR-->F1 season.
Can you send the link?  Also that definitely looks like a rose on Joey to me!
Omgg yayy pictures
She probably started with 26/27 like they did in past seasons so probably around 12 guys going into week 5!
They typically go from 15 to 12 after week 4.
Do you know which men got eliminated? How many men in week 2?
Four!
Bachelorwhatever IG (subject realistic here)
Were they exclusive/boyfriend and girlfriend?
He didn't get a 1:1 just won extra time with her after the getting the group date rose, hopefully he won't actually get one then.
Agree, but it becomes an issue when they aren’t actually single or open lol
In the Washington state area! They’re staying at the Skamania Lodge in Stevenson, WA.
I sent it to you in a message!
The only guy that I’m pretty sure got eliminated week two is Joshua
Thank you!!! Do we know if it’s tonight?
As we've learnt from Andrew S exclusive is different from boyfriend/girlfriend. 🤣
It’s actually the Portland Oregon area, but across the river in WA. Washington state area always makes me think of Seattle.
Thanks.
Oh ok! I just reposted what RS said, I always wanted think of Seattle too lol
I’m watching Desiree’s season for the first time, and I knew that Carly’s brother had been on the show as well, but it’s wild that he made it all the hometowns! I feel like I’ve never seen anyone mention it on here. She’s a big part of his hometown, too.
Just waiting on the kind person that listened to Ariel on Almost famous pod to give us recap, thank you for your service in advance ❤️
I'm so glad Shandy decided to recap LIB season 4, and I hope they keep it up!
https://twitter.com/thebachbabes/status/1643249419876171778?s=46&t=P6hq1_IJU_Ads0qMty_c5g did anyone see this? I’m very confused!
Tayshia and Zac would’ve lasted longer if CH didn’t get himself fired and she didn’t host two seasons of the Bachelorette.  Those two never got used to a normal life together because of her being away for weeks on end. I also think the hosting gig made her double down on influencing as a career path, and convinced her she had a long term future as a social media celebrity. Without that gig, she likely would’ve gotten into the mentality that she’s another BN star that has come and gone, that her days being relevant are numbered, and she would’ve seriously considered settling down.   I’m not saying it would’ve ended in marriage, but I think it would’ve lasted longer.
Did anyone listen to Jason’s podcast with Kaitlyn?
Why do I kind of get the vibe that Ariel doesn’t like Kat… maybe I’m just overthinking it
I can’t decide which is better: Rachel’s season or Arie’s
“You deserve someone who chooses you first everyday”  That’s such a SICK thing to say. Especially since she’s begging him to stop talking, AND HE KEEPS GOING. Sickening and cruel.   Zach and production deserve more criticism with how they treated Gabi. I understand that production can manipulate people, but c’mon. Zach pumped and dumped her. Publicly declared it, made a big speech at the fantasy suites rose ceremony. He’s worse than Clayton, Clayton was truely in love with three girls, Zach didn’t seem to care about Gabi at all.
I really liked him. I believe he was asked to be interviewed as a potential bachelor but turned it down because he'd just started dating his now wife.
Is that one of her bikini pieces? Cause there’s literally nothing modest about it
That feels like an April fools joke.
Did something in particular happen which made you think so?
Rachel's, hands down. Arie's season wasn't particularly interesting until the end, and even that was a twist that's already happened before.  Rachel's season was SO good. From the whole DeMario debacle, to Blake and Whaboom's absurdity, to crying her eyelashes off with Peter, to Dean's intense hometown, to the emotional breakup with Kenny, to Adam Jr...really strong season all the way through and IMO she had the hottest group of guys. She's also so charismatic and sparkly as a lead.
I liked Arie’s season much, much more than Rachel’s, and that’s because I was much less invested in Arie’s. Rachel’s season had several very uncomfortable aspects for me as a Black woman watching.   1. The fact that they allowed Lee on her season was absolutely disgusting;  2. They forced her to go on a date with Will, a Black guy who doesn’t date Black women;   3. I could tell right away that Peter wasn’t all in; and it was upsetting for me to see Rachel trying so hard with him, and that it took her 4hrs to break up with him when he was perhaps the only F2 in the history of the show that wasn’t willing to propose;   4. I was rooting for Bryan the entire time, but the proposal was sort of depressing: the wind, Rachel’s very swollen eyes, the “give it to me.” I was very disappointed; and  5. The AFR and everyone’s reaction thereto was just plain up racist.
Rachel!
I think Arie’s cast was better than Rachel’s, BUT Rachel and Peter’s breakup was some of the most memorable tv I’ve seen, whereas Arie’s breakup with Becca was just cringey to watch.
Idk why people say Aries season was good. I’m pretty open minded about seasons and always watch but his season was the one season ever that I quit watching midway because I was so bored 😭 I only tuned back in when I heard about the finale drama
Gabi is an adult who chose to have sex knowing full well that:  1. Zach was still dating two other women; 2. His preference was to abstain; 3. He was still undecided; and 4. Statistically, odds are he would chose someone else over her.   Gabi made her own bed & slept in it! She said on Click Bait that she discussed with Zach that having sex with him did not mean he was necessarily going to pick her.
Ahh that makes sense. I was wondering why we never saw him in BIP either. Seeing what great guys Desiree had in her top 5 makes it even crazier than Juan Pablo somehow became bachelor just because people liked him on Twitter apparently lol
That makes sense!!! 🤦🏽‍♀️
Whenever Kat posts about Ariel on her stories or anything else, Ariel doesn't exactly repost it. Not saying she has to, and who knows, maybe she's replying to Kat privately, but Ariel tends to repost things from the other girls. They were also roommates, so they must've been pretty close, but after the Charity thing I'm not sure. Ariel has went on two podcasts discussing the Kat and Charity drama and on neither podcast has she said anything about how her and Kat are now friends. It seems like she's still condemning Kat for something that happened a while ago. And she went on Nick's podcast AFTER the several girls trips that the girls have been on.
Peter vs Bryan was a moment for the ages but you had to be there. It’s probably not the same watching now as when we watched while airing. Eric’s shock at will not dating black women and will telling Rachel on the date! Josiah and Kenny were entertainment. Introduction of dean lol
Very valid.   Aesthetically, Arie’s season was superior, not just because of the varying locations/climates but also the outfits to match the locations. For example, Becca in her dress in Tuscany was chef’s kiss.  Then again, Rachel’s men didn’t have much of an opportunity to show off their style and the climate was all the same everywhere.
What gets me about the whole situation is the, “you deserve someone who chooses you first everyday” and she was begging him to stop talking. It’s so unnecessarily cruel
True. I'm not sure what happened with Drew  but I guess they were worried about backlash with Brooks after he broke up with Des to make him the next lead. So JP was kinda the next best option at the time I guess lol.
Actually, it is real. She's released a collab with cupshe: [https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/madi-prewett-on-wearing-modest-swimsuits-that-align-with-her-faith/](https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/madi-prewett-on-wearing-modest-swimsuits-that-align-with-her-faith/)
It definitely was a season to watch live. That was also a season of so many firsts - first time they introduced contestants at ATFR, first time they kept the F3 together for Fantasy Suite week, first time they had the lead watch the finale live. Those things were a lot crazier to watch then than I'm sure they are now.
Bachelor seasons will always have the edge in terms of style just by virtue of the fact that women have more options for and inclination toward fashion, though I will say that Rachel's style was a highlight of her season for me as well. [This was probably my favorite look of hers](https://imgur.com/6AjncqH) but she had so many stunning outfits, both date ensembles and rose ceremony dresses.
He wasn’t trying to be cruel tho. He was trying to make her feel better about herself, which of course he failed at.
Sigh - I was curious (b/c I love cute bathing suits but dont have the butt or the courage for the current minimal booty coverage styles) so I went and looked.    Was sad that these weren't cute :(.  (but maybe not surprised)  Can Krystal from Arie's season please get a cupshe deal?
And first black lead. It felt like so many people were watching. I remember different media outlets reporting on the season you don’t usually see. And of course the wrong spoiler.   We will never have that high again lol only Hannah b has done it since. Though Colton gave us the fence jump. I’d argue Clare ending the season early for dale was the last exciting thing to even happen in this franchise.  Things really went downhill after clayshia
Oh yeah! I was obsessed with Rachel’s style. I only wear blue, red, black, forest green and grey because of her
I agree completely with this. He was not trying to be cruel, though he was.  He really didn’t understand how to make her feel better.
Agree he wasn’t trying to be cruel, but disagree that he was trying to make her feel better. He was trying to make himself feel better by being the “nice guy” in the breakup. If he really wanted to make her feel better he would’ve respected her when she told him at least twice, maybe three times, to stop talking.
Clare was the last time I was enraptured by the franchise too, the most batshit three episodes of television in a long time.  Rachel's season is the gold standard for me for so many reasons. Best lead, best cast (Lee excepted), best discussions here, and a lasting marriage to boot. I can't think of another season that hits all of those high points, though Hannah's is up there for me as well just for the chaos.
First time they actually had a decent group of non white contestants in the house too.
Clare also had a real history with the franchise and engaging personality plus attractive. And tayshia is a bombshell IMO the male contestants have also fallen way off which is a big problem for this franchise. This franchise can’t survive the way male casting has gone recently. Hopefully some care was put into the casting of charity’s men  Could you imagine Clare or tayshia for the record being with any of these top men from Katie, Michelle or gabby/Rachel’s season. They both would’ve walked away single if they had the options of recent bachelorette. Could you imagine Rachel, Jojo, des, etc with any of these men?
Gabby and Rachel’s season was an all-time low. Normally there’s at least one or two men I would consider dating in the real world but their group was truly bottom of the barrel.  Rachel would walk off set and buy out her contract if she was faced with the likes of Erich, Tino, and Johnny lmao.
Her credit score is fair which was shocking to me..I'd of thought by now jason could have helped her get it to at least good..also, imo..jason seemed like he wanted a joint venture and was bummed she wants no part of that.
This is one of the first episodes I’ve listened to of his that didn’t really give much detail? Seemed like another interview about Kaitlyns journey which has been said before. Hoping part 2 dives more into her businesses and those finances since that is what his pod is for!
Anyone able to give a quick recap of what they talked about?
I was struck by how little she trusts others with finances (i.e needed to be married before considering going into business with Jason) but it makes sense based on her past
I missed the "part 1" a little in the title and found it so jarring when the podcast cut the audio right in the middle of a sentence that Kaitlyn was saying lol and went to the recap before it was explained later that there's a pt 2 ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sweat_smile)
Did she post about it at all to help him promote it or congratulate him on his 100th episode?
I didn’t listen to it yet, worth it?
Yep, this podcast reaffirmed to me that finances are the holdup on the marriage. Wouldn’t be surprised if she wants a prenup and he’s not down.  He kept pushing for joint ventures and she said she wouldn’t without some type of commitment from him like marriage.  Honestly, made me proud of her. She’s holding her ground & protecting her assets/brand.   It also made me doubt him & his overall intentions in the relationship. 😕
Same lol
Nothing you haven't already heard if you listen to OTV.
it’s worth listening to honestly
If you’re looking for finance advice r/personalfinance wiki is the best.  Especially the flow chart
that was actually surprising... they've been engaged YEARS at this point. a little surprised that all of a sudden being married would allow her to go into business with Jason all of a sudden?
Honestly I just think she knows they'd butt heads too much on decision making for whatever business they created.
I mean, they have been together for a while and engaged! My fiance and I don't feel weird talking about our exes if it comes up
I mean exes are always exes for a reason :) (and Jason def strikes me as secure)
Yeah, she posted one of his stories on her story. No added text, nothing 😂😂😂. It looked pretty bare minimum.  Married or not, engaged or not, it’s really nice to feel like your partner genuinely supports you and is rooting for you and wants the best for you in whatever you’re doing. Sure, maybe that happens behind closed doors, but when your job is being a public persona and you have public ventures… She felt used by Shawn and maybe that’s why she doesn’t post a lot of public support of Jason. Certainly not with the same energy he does for her.
Yes. She posted about it on Monday when it came out on her story.
They really didn’t say anything that wasn’t already said on hundreds of other podcasts
I agree! Something with finances is holding them up. Whether it’s prenup or how they want to split their finances etc. Jason strikes me as being “traditional” and wanting to split everything 50/50 and she may not want that.
Because marriage is a legally binding contract that offers you certain protections and/or rights to what you build together [financially] once you’re married, plus different tax structures and breaks, etc. It’s not just about trust. It’s probably a sound decision on her end.
Well, if he’s dragging his heels for years in an engagement without committing to an actual marriage, I don’t blame her for waiting to see if the actual marriage even happens before letting him in on her brand.
On that story she had the link to the podcast if you clicked on it. Not sure what else she needs to do, she also talked about it on her IG live on Monday. If you have noticed, Kaitlyn barely promotes her own podcast , she had an episode out yesterday and she didn't even post about it.
I think she posted the perfect amount and she will post next week I’m sure too. I agree with the other poster here good for her for standing her ground not going into business with him and having boundaries .. pretty clear it’s him that’s holding up wedding etc or making excuses etc and he takes advantage of her enough . Otherwise for all we know he could be another Shawn , using her to the max for connections / publicity , time he stepped up on the marriage / wedding front otherwise he’s just another  loser user. Edit to add that episode with her is Number 1 in Canada business podcasts so he’s def benefitting with the downloads etc he’s doing just fine …
Thanks lol
oh yes good point but tbh on the pod she indicated heavily that it’s more about trust for her. she talked about how she felt sean used her (didn’t want to be with her anymore but stuck it out til his gym opened)
yeah if so, totally agree.. but do we think that’s happening? i feel like it’s unknown why they’re engagement has been lengthy?
Fair fair points. I can’t help my little gut feeling though
Sure but i think she is just doing it her own way and how she promotes her own stuff. She is not doing it Jasons way, she is doing it her own. I get if you are comparing it to him but i think thats just how he has always been and Kaitlyn is also being herself. When i think logically, Jason promotes his own stuff every day, posts clips of his own podcasts almost daily, on other hand , Kaitlyn promotes her own podcast "maybe" once a week. so its just how she does things.
Jordan shared a picture of him and Jojo a couple years ago that he said had never been shared before and it was them during her season he had snuck out to meet her and they had a little romantic rendezvous. Was obviously off camera since it never aired. He said a producer helped them. I’m guessing the reason they didn’t show it is because it would’ve been even more obvious how much she was into him and was choosing him
Emily supposedly snuck around, and was hooking up with Arie.
Colton's fence jump and then being allowed to end the season is up there
Ben F. supposedly had a ton of hook ups before fantasy suites on his season!
Not really rule-breaking, but I think she said she was drunk for most of the season!
Bob Guinea apparently slept or hooked up with a bunch of women all season.
I think this is fairly common. We just don't hear about it.
How about that one lady who swore she met her husband like episode 3 or something bc he was the hottest one so then they had to bring in a new bachelorette? Lmao I don’t even remember her name but it was ridiculous
I think it happens more than it’s shown. I think they just only decide to use it if it “fits” their narrative they give the lead
But she also was clearly punished. They kept her in Ireland for the entire rest of the season and her proposals were at the mansion
I just heard Ben H talk about coming in third on her season the other day and I had a hard time even grasping that when I thought back. Talk about two people who couldn’t be more further a match
Oh i'm sure. I remember Deanna was on Kaitlyns podcast a few years ago and she mentioned how she sneaked into guys rooms a few times. Lauren said she did too on Aries season. I'm sure alot of things happen that we don't know about.
She was a fantastic lead. And the beginning of her season was so chauvinistic. CH opens up with "people are upset, but change is hard" (in regard to them having two female leads and then having the men VOTE ON THEIR FAVORITE). Like, are you kidding? This wasn't some progressive movement. It was the opposite.
I think that was because Kaitlyn was very unconventional. Like she literally asked Chris to plow her field. So she was already looked at as bold. I just think that producers saw that being talked about and to draw in viewers at get the show attention they played on that. Because clearly someone had to know about her and Nick talking prior to even bring him on the show. It doesn’t just happen lol. The show is known to stir the pot with anyone willing to do it. And clearly Nick was willing to do it
Uh Clare…
Just wondering, how are you watching Kaitlyn’s season? I was looking for it the other day and couldn’t find it.
What does this season stream on?
I think those producers know the psychology of sneaking around to creat a bond, and I suspect that’s why they were doing it with both Shawn and Nick with Kaitlyn.
Oh snap
And apparently he had a girlfriend the entire time
No shit? Wild. I had no idea.
Came here to say this. And nobody slut-shamed him for it
Ha! I was looking for his name. I’m not sure there’s a “rule” against being a fuck boy on the show, but people certainly weren’t expecting that when it came out.   I’d say that was received better by the public than Kaitlyn having first date sex with Nick. Though that’s waaaaaay more of an everyday thing for most of us. Nothing wrong with having sex with like 6.5 people (or whatever it was) in as many weeks as the show took to film, but I know waaaaay more people who have first date sex.
That was Clare. Clare & Tayshia's season.
I thought productions travel plans fell through for the country after Ireland, which is why they switched the weeks for hometowns and overnights.
What!! Did not know this about Lauren and Arie
When did lauren say this
I watched it recently on Hulu
Hulu
Joe Bailey said on a podcast that he helped Kaitlyn sneak into Shawn’s room one night
Are they still together?
On Kaitlyns podcast a few weeks ago.
Oh ok, thank you so much for letting me know! I don’t have Hulu at the moment but that’s good to know.
Big no, they were on and off for a bit but tanked badly. Clare is married now though to some other guy (non BN) and they seem happy
LOL no they broke up and got back together a couple times but Clare celebrated her one year marriage anniversary to another man like last week  EDIT: anniversary of something. I assumed marriage lol
It’s been a while since I signed up, but I think you can get a free one week trial. Also, on Black Friday, they usually run deals where you can get it for $1 or $2/ month for a year. After that it goes back to its regular price. But you can also flip between two different emails and always get the deal. Also, the student Spotify connects to Hulu if that is an option for you
1 year anniversary of him showing up
Can’t have been the one year marriage anniversary. They just got married two months ago. But Clare kind of strikes me as a person who celebrates the anniversary of every milestone, so it was probably the one-year anniversary of something else.
Thank you so so much for all of that info, that’s really helpful!! I’m not a student but those other options are great! I really appreciate you taking the time to help me so much!!❤️
😂
*one year of peeing with the door open*  *Pops champagne*
Yep that post was for their two-month anniversary 😅 Clare clarified in a comment
Maybe one year dating anniversary.
Hey just chiming in to offer info - this isn’t a partnership or brand deal. Just the social media team sending the collab request on a pic of him (99% of the time because they want his reach from his account) and him accepting it! Not any official deal 🙂
and this is why they lost today
I left this man in 2021. Let’s keep him there please 😩
Idk if it helps, almost all of the responses on Twitter are just, "who the fuck is this guy?" and annoyance
Unfortunately, I don’t think the allegations against joe ever reached the general public outside of this sub. Not that that would stop some brands, some don’t care… but it always seemed like that scandal never hit the mainstream media like some other BN controversies. Which bugs me tbh. US weekly never misses an opportunity to break a racism scandal but ignores when a woman speaks out about being violated
JFC. After all the women who came forward???  ![gif](giphy|l0MYzxkg0o1tkGSaI)
He doesn’t get it consensually
Ugh, I hate that smug smile of his. 🖕🏾Can’t believe that there are organizations out there that actually want to be associated with this SOB. Joe belongs in jail, PERIOD.
Spill the tea guys
aint he a rapist
I swear Joe had a controversy. I'm surprised anyone acknowledges him.
This pisses me off.
Highly doubt wild fans even care about the bachelorette
Y’all even if the allegations against Joe reached the public, do we *really* think the NHL would give a single solitary fuck about them? I say this as someone who has been involved in hockey since birth, has been active in hockey communities through adulthood, who had to (for my own self-preservation) disavow the team I’ve loved and supported for decades because of a truly heinous sexual assault situation. Even IF they knew about the allegations? It wouldn’t even come close to being a dealbreaker. It probably wouldn’t even cross their minds that people might care.
> Joe Coleman gets it  And allegedly takes it
I literally forgot he existed.... thanks OP
I hate that it seems like some people are celebrating this creep. (Not on this sub, but outside of it)
I actually recoiled on seeing this.. and to think that he was my favourite on Michelle's season for her, just goes to show that even the nicest seeming guy can and will be a rapist and present a completely different, normal persona to gain your trust. Disgusting human, I hope he's locked up soon.
Between this and pride night, the wild are not one of my favorites rn
gross. I am never watching this sport again. Good luck operating without me
i literally flinched seeing him. ew ew ewwwwww!!
Wow I didn’t know about the allegations against him, he came off as fairly sweet on the show.
Ugh definitely feel a little triggered seeing his smug face. Gives me shivers.
Also I understand if this isn’t allowed but I hope it is, since this is basically the only place where BN fans actually care about serious issues. But…I understand if it’s not.
I liked it better when he was shunned from oblivion on this sub. If he gets posted here, at least block his face? I’m pretty sure some sub members rather not see this.
What’s the point of posting him?  He should be banned from this sub
Hell no I see exactly what they're doing
Ugh. Such a pos.
Hockeys really been using F list celebs. Some Florida team used Tc’s brother Ryan
Gross. It's really not necessary to post every little thing every person does..
[removed]
That’s a big relief tbh! He’s had other sponsorships that I’ve seen which sucks but I’m glad he’s not getting any money from them at least
Nonetheless it is disgusting, and he shouldn’t be getting any attention whatsoever, but it isn’t a deal of any sort!
But in true MN sport fashion they pulled off a spot in the playoffs… not that it will go anywhere, but we get to pretend!  Unrelated but ya know. Wild > him
LOL love this
I feel like the same thing happened with other men in the franchise—Lincoln, Eazy, and I’m sure there are others I’m forgetting. We’re still so far behind when it comes to listening to women
Seriously I hated that too. This one was worse than many that did hit the mainstream media.
So unfortunate and really irritating. Pisses me off, too. I feel like there was definitely enough chatter for it to be picked up.
Not during Sexual Assault Awareness Month too 😖
it seems like at least the other contestants have distanced themselves from him
I completely forgot what he did. Why do we not like Joe again?
Allegedly has many SA allegations and one of his survivors posted about their experience with him on this sub
Michelle and Fleiss were well aware of the allegations again Joe but Michelle was still drooling over him the whole season
We exist 🤣 but this partnership is weird af
Also a Blackhawks fan. I feel this😞
Right, the NHL is actually the worst of the major American sports leagues when it comes to this kind of thing - which really tells you something.
Okay book nerd here but Beartown by Frederick Bachman embodies exactly what you just said lol
I get this is meant to be a joke, but that's homophobic.
I guess a lot of people outside of this sub don't know about the allegations against him.
Honestly no, no one else is banned.  If we start banning BN the list who we can talk about is very short.
I’m calling out the Wild for working with a rapist, hope that’s cool with you. I don’t post *anything* this asshole does, I don’t see anyone else posting him either
No, that is an incorrect assumption. Source: https://www.rainn.org/statistics/criminal-justice-system
😭😭 you just summed it up perfectly
the stuff with lincoln definitely reached the general public. i remember the show having to issue a statement about it. that’s definitely an exception to the rule though.
It’s so exhausting and frustrating that you’re correct.
💯
He SAted a bunch of women when he was in college and got away with it (all because he was a star basketball player). Some of the survivors came here back in 2021 (during Michelle’s season) and posted their stories.
a woman came forward about him SAing her. I think if you search the sub you can find more on that
Michelle wasn’t aware and there was no indication the show knew before the season.   Unless I missed a report
How do we know Michelle knew ?
What? I'm talking about sexual assault allegations.
I guess you're right, but I'm just surprised word hasn't gotten out at this point
What are the allegations?
I think Chad still is but other than that, no one
Lincoln was prosecuted and found guilty, though.
Oh gawd, sorry. I knew about the allegations, but I've been dealing with some homophobia/transphobia recently so I think I projected on you and misunderstood. I'm so, SO sorry!! Yikes. Clearly I need some sleep...  ![gif](giphy|Qh4FSYVY3jvmeVjRur)
It's interesting. People outside of the fanbase literally know nothing.
How could they know? No one talks about it.
Long story short he's been accused for years by about a dozen (or more?) women of various sexual assaults and rapes. The basic gist is that it is so well-known in his community that women eventually got warned "Don't be left alone in a room with Joe Coleman".
Serial Rapist
I thought he was okay now.  I swear I have seen mentions of him recently now that he’s not putting himself in danger.     ETA: There was a post about him A month ago.
Wow HATE THAT. Almost glad I missed that story.
Nooo.  It still hurts this Cubs fans heart to see Rizzo as a Yankee.  But will love him always!
Kris Bryant (former Cub now Rockie) is Ben Higgins and you can’t convince me otherwise
forever a cub in my heart :'(
Respect the Rizz 😤 but honestly, I can see it
Anthony Rizzo is a God. Pilot Pete only wishes he could be like him.
Bachelor Nation AND diehard Yankees fan here 😄: I didn’t think so initially, but when you see Rizzo in motion, he and PP DO indeed have similar smiles/facial expressions!
Anthony Rizzo is an angel on earth.
please don't slander Anthony Rizzo like this
THANK YOU. I have been trying to place who Pilot Pete reminds me of since HB’s season.
My good Italian boy! Man I miss seeing him on the Cubs.  Respectfully though…no.
THAT’S MY BOY!!! (You leave Rizzo out of this lol)
LOL I was at the gym the other day and thought one of the athletes looked like PP and it was totally this guy, so I agree
So strange that when you first look he does resemble him a lot but the longer you stare, the more he starts to look way different.   But with any doppelgängers seeing them in real time and 3D always matters way more than one photo.
Peter wishes he was as wholesome as Rizzo! Now that you mention it they do look alike though 🥲
What game is everyone watching tonight?   My Rangers lost to the Orange Birds.   The Astros are losing to the Tigers.   But at least the Giants won! (They are my NL team because their manager is hot & I love watching Camilo Doval pitch.)
Oh no lol.
Aww, if it makes you feel better, we love and appreciate him here!!   Also, [this](https://pinstripesnation.com/anthony-rizzo-aaron-judge-bonding-is-special-due-to-their-dogs-2022-12-26/) was fate.
Kris>>>>>> Ben
💯💯
To be clear, fully agree that the physical resemblance is the ONLY similarity.   Rizzo exponentially > PP all day.
The Cubs v Reds game! My beloveds (the Cubs) are off to a shaky-ass start but I love them anyway.   Also, the Giants coach is SO HOT. Like, holy shit.
Love that!
Not disrespecting him at all!
YESSS. He was super hot -- a different kind of hot -- when he was a player too. #babekapler  https://preview.redd.it/crmyhnuhg0sa1.jpeg?width=537&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=69c7c0106c20ffc35058a35ce2ee9e7c761b8c60
Their talent management agency is doing a retreat in Nashville for a couple of days
Huh, they are all moms except Kelley
Is Catherine, Shaun’s Catherine?
I’m sure they’re there to join in the peaceful protests after the school shooting... Seriously, check in on Nashville politics right now. Peaceful protestors being called insurrectionists, and representatives being expelled for peacefully protesting. I get that photos like these are part of being an influencer but it looks so foolish with what’s actually happening there.
SNL saying all bachelorette parties happen in Nashville was so good
this is the most random group of BN people i've ever seen
Wow this is wildly random 😂
This talent agency represents a ton of BN people.  This is also the same talent company that people piled on Arie and Lauren for because the owner of the company said babies make the best influencers, meanwhile most of who he represents are parents.
Hampton Social is so fun—great drinks! Really good oysters too
I know Carly and Ashley are friends (both from Chris season) but the rest is super random!
Has anyone eaten at this restaurant? I’m planning a Nash Bash in June and was thinking this would be a good brunch spot.
Yup. Random group of women
For some reason I thought Carly was tall. Lol.
Ashley is aging well. She just looks better and better!
if we get an announcement in the next year, i’m remembering this comment 👀
Yes
Nashville resident here - glad to see someone saying it 🥺
As annoying as she is, at least Ali F is out there joining in on the protests at the capital.
Thank you for saying it! As a Nashville resident, former k teacher and now SAHM, this shit pisses me off. It’s been a week since everything happened.
That was my thought - oh are they there to join in the protests? No? Ok. Tennessee has quietly been making moves towards fascism rule, so it’s no surprise they don’t give a rat’s ass about the actual people living there.
Agreed. It feels very distractiony
How is this not being talked about more??? Oh wait, I forgot we could watch Trump's plane take off and land 😒
All of them are represented/managed by the same talent agency
As in "have a baby to extend your influencer brand?"
Tia and Krystal were also on the same season of bachelor and BIP lol
You need to make reservations early because it fills up! I enjoyed the food but it came out super quick ( we were in and out in 45 minutes). So, i think they premake a bunch and it waits to be ordered. But the rosé is good and it makes for cute pictures!
I’ve been there! The food is so good but omg the decor and view on the second floor is worth it!
I just want you to be prepared… Bach parties in Nashville look fun, lots of great photo ops and places to buy $10+ beers, but please know that you will be stuck in a sea of bodies almost everywhere you go. In June it STINKS to high heavens and it will be at least 95°, even hotter in the bars. Also, almost every bach party ends up with a cheater (or if you’re lucky, a single friend) making out with a “cowboy” and pissing everyone off. You will need to drink a LOT of water. I’ll spare you from the political mess that the honky tonks are a part of.
Nash resident here—it’s very touristy. I work in that building but I’ve never been. It’s literally catered to Bach parties so it’s perfect for that. But, it will be crowded AF so prepare in advance.   Beware though that June is also CMA fest in Nashville, so make sure you’re not going that week unless it’s intentional.   Also June will be hot as hades. Not sure where you’re coming from but the humidity don’t play. It will be disgusting and you will be sweaty and gross. lol Just an FYI.
Yes it’s super cute! Great food too!
Yes!! Super cute vibes and walls to take pics. Food and drinks were delish too!!
True! She is so beautiful!
I was pleasantly surprised to see this
Lol sorry, I have to laugh at the word “talent”. I don’t mean to be rude or the “b” word but talent for being on a reality tv show? I’m not that old (Millennial) and remember the times before influencers and when talent agencies were for athletes, musicians, actors/actresses, and models. Not a whole fan of the influencing thing but I do love the show and that’s why I follow this Reddit!
Gotcha
But are they friends? I know they were on the same season but it seems Ashley actually hangs out with Carly and Jade.
Personal Nashville favorite brunch spots is Butcher and Bee or the Mockingbird ❤️
I work at this location! There is a lot of prep work done for efficiency, but all the food is made fresh! On a brunch shift, there’s at least 25 people on the line making food 😂 it’s insane to walk through the kitchen those days
Which restaurant?
> Also, almost every bach party ends up with a cheater (or if you’re lucky, a single friend) making out with a “cowboy” and pissing everyone off.  I’m sure this is a serious thing, but it made me laugh. Why do people get pissed if the person is single? Kills the vibe of the party?
Lol yup new era ..considered a real job too
I’ll check those places out. Thank you!
Oh good to know!! The short rib Benedict was very yummmy!!
Hampton social
Good question! I think it boils down to drunken jealousy.  Mostly “this is supposed to be a girls trip!” or the unspoken “omg what a sloot”. Note, only the grossest local dudes go to prey on out of town hotties.   I should also mention that there are soooo many other reasons bach parties fight. Maybe because someone gets lost/separated from the group; they get too drunk and can’t hang/need to get an iv/crash their scooter and get carted away in an ambulance; or someone heard about a cool dive bar in east nashville and the group splits up to talk shit about each other.  10 years ago honky tonking was amazing but it’s just not that anymore. Nashville is literally in the shitter.
Sinema has great brunch too! They also do a Bloody Mary and mimosa bar. Love their grapefruit mimosa!! Make reservations.
I’d also check out Liberty Common for brunch - it’s right next to Hampton Social and honestly wayyyy better. Super cute too!
> crash their scooter and get carted away in an ambulance  I also know this isn’t funny. But I didn’t see it coming and laughed out loud.   Sounds like a lot of these women need to train to go to Nashville. Like a qualifying event similar to qualifying for a marathon.
I saw this one last week! And it wasn’t the first time!
Tried to watch it three separate occasions and my fiancée is unable to view a single episode without ordering pizza so it’s now banned in our household.
The reason why I avoided this show in particular was that it seemed too niche. JUST making pizza opposed to a variety of dishes seemed kinda boring, but I just finished the first episode and I’m liking it so far!  Wells is killing it! He’s charming, quick on his feet with the witty responses, and genuinely hilarious. I never would have guessed he’d do this well from what I’ve seen of him on paradise but he’s an incredible host. I found myself actually laughing out loud several times during the first episode.  I may still get sick of them just making pizza, but I love cooking competition shows and I legitimately ran out haha.   The first episode was 3 Italian nonnas competing and the second will be pizza influencers. The first round seems to be some bizarre pizza challenge, like pizza cupcakes, while the second is more traditional.
Top chef remains supreme, my favorite of all the cooking shows. Better than Hell’s Kitchen and master chef. I was a little bummed out at first when I learned this season was a world all stars with top placing chefs from all the versions of top chef around the world because I wouldn’t know half of them. But I’m actually really liking seeing the difference cultures of food and cooking.  Also surprisingly Gordon’s new show next level chef is pretty good. Richard Blais from top chef is one of the judges/mentors as is Nyesha Herrington who was also on top chef one season.
Y’all I just put on episode 1 to watch with you 😭🥰
I loved it! Got stoned, ate pizza, watched Wells eat pizza, it was a complete and fulfilling experience lol
I just watched it based on your post and the first episode was so fun!! I loved the nonnas
Im assuming youve watched the baking championships with Jesse Palmer as host :-) theyre so fun
He was fun to watch on worst cooks in America if you haven’t seen that!
I never even heard of this.
a small business from my city was on that!
If you're cooking show obsessed, it has nothing to do with The Bachelor, but I highly recommend Pressure Cooker on Netflix!! I just watched it and it was so good. A quick 9 episodes, it's a bit of a twist on the traditional cooking show where there's a social strategy game element like Big Brother.
I did as background noise. I actually like his podcast and listen to it and he was telling Brandi to watch it so I ended up giving it a go. There were funny moments but I rarely watch shows like that in general so I really wasn’t paying attention the entire time lol
I can see it causing an increase in pizza orders. 😂 maybe watch it once a month with pizza and make it a cute little tradition?
I actually have always really liked Wells. I’m from Nashville as well so maybe that helped but I’m a sucker for his goofy good guy schtick- and I like Sarah hyland and him together! They seem so into each other lol (I know they’re married now 🥰)
I love Top Chef! I binge-watched every season available on streaming. (Actually that's a lie. The first few seasons were such potato quality I had to skip them. I think I started on season 5.) I think I'm just two seasons behind now. I hope they hurry up and release them. I think I still like Masterchef a bit more though...   I think Next Level Chef has become my new favorite! I love all the Gordon Ramsay competition shows, but this one is just super cool and I love Richard and Nyesha. Richard's season is still my favorite of Top Chef.
Aww, let us know what you think! The nonnas are so funny haha.
Sounds magical.
The nonnas were hilarious, especially the one that was kind of a jerk haha.
No, I’ve never seen that!!
I haven’t! I skipped over that one too because I like watching people make… good food? Is the show good? I love cooking, so I don’t want to be infuriated haha.
It’s on Hulu!
Really?! Which episode?
I watched that one! I loved it, although my girl Lana went home way too early. The subterfuge did mildly upset me haha, but I’m happy one of the good guys won.
I have a soft spot for him for the same reason. I remember driving to work when he worked at Lightning 100 and hearing his “Good Morning, Nashville” made me happy haha
Wells was never a favorite of mine during his season, but he’s grown on me post-season! He and Sarah truly do seem to adore each other in a way not a lot of couples do. I hope they have a long and happy marriage!
Season 4 is definitely a must watch season.   Also, I’ve really been enjoying Tournament of a champions on food network
Richard was first on season 4 and came in second place. Then returned for all stars.   I agree the first couple seasons were such a low budget production when they were first starting out. They used that little wind up kitchen timer. It got good starting season 4. That’s the first season they have away a car and it was Richard Blais who won the car but lost the season. Season 6 was my favorite when they were in Vegas and started the high stakes quick fires giving away $10,000 with some of the challenge wins plus I loved the Voltagio brothers. I don’t think they’ve given away a car since the Houston season. 14? I think? I wish they still did it.
I really like Next Level Chef too👍
when that one nonna said >!”pizza cupcakes…? i’m not doing that”!< LOL
oh my gosh - you HAVE to. Jesse is such a fun host. I watch on hulu and Discovery+.  Jesse starts as the Host in Season 4 of Holiday Baking Championship!
It’s less infuriating as the season goes on because people really get better! It’s one of my favorites.
I watched it a while ago but it was entertaining that’s for sure haha but the cooking was sub par 🤣 plus there were some fun celebs on his season!
Thank you!
Episode 5! Their name is Devoured Pizza and the person who makes the pizzas name is Jhy.
Yes!! I'm from Delaware so Robbie had my heart from the beginning!!
I wish I had food network! I just have steaming right now. I wonder if I can just buy food network through the app…
I love Tournament of Chanpions. It’s my favorite food competition show right now (over the past three years). And I watch a lot of them.
Our family watches one match every night at dinner time. We love it! And it’s hilarious to hear my excessively picky teenage boy critique all the fancy dishes.
Yes, I watched the season where he won! I was rooting for him all season. I love his mind for innovation. Also, season one was filmed in 2005 and everything was kinda blurry back then by today's standards haha. Trying to watch it 15 years later just made me twitchy haha. The visual quality quickly increased though. Season 5 was a big difference than the 5 minutes I watched of season 1.   I love the Voltagio brothers, too! I'm really wishing Bryan won his last season. He deserved it and it's gotta be hard knowing your brother won the show and you didn't after multiple seasons.
I’m the anomaly who loved those first couple of seasons, and aside from restaurant wars, liked the earlier seasons better in many cases than the newer ones. I need to see if I can catch a recent season. The last one I watched was impacted by Covid, I think. I can’t even remember if I finished it.
LOL, that part was hilarious. She totally thought it would be an unholy abomination.
Yeah the first episode is always the worst lol but I love this show and I feel like I learn some small tricks too, it’s like dumbed down cooking lol but to answer OP the chefs do make good food!
I’ll root for them when I get to that episode haha.
Do you have Discovery Plus or Philo? Tournament of Champions is fantastic and has a lot of TC alums. I think Beat Bobby Flay has episodes on Hulu
Have you ever watched Chopped? on the food network? If you’re looking for a cooking show to watch there’s like 57 seasons of it 😁
I was rooting for Bryan too 😊
That season that Covid hit and they had to shoot differently and couldn’t go anywhere else for challenges was not as good. They couldn’t get out like they usually do and there weren’t any visiting judges like usual. They used the past winners and runners up for the guest judges. It was better than nothing but really wasn’t like the rest of the show. There were like 2 normal seasons after that plus this current one. I like a lot of the earlier seasons. The first season is strange though, especially with Katie Joel as the host instead of Padma. Katie had no personality and very little expression. She almost seemed robotic.
I’ll have to see if it’s on any of the streaming platform. I don’t have cable! But I haven’t watched it yet.
Yeah, I know people didn’t like her. I prefer Padma, too. But, for me, there’s something more wholesome about early seasons of shows before the contestants learn to “game” the system. Not in a bad way, just they adapt and learn to play the game. In those early seasons, there’s less/none of that. I’m not saying later seasons aren’t good. Just that I really liked those early seasons.
I think the only way split week could work if they increased the length of filming to like 30 days, so they’d actually be time afterward to make up for the lost days.   It doesn’t work with the 18 day filming timeline. I believe Brandon said in a podcast decision day was like four days after Serene and the other original women got back to the beach. That probably explains the lack of successful couples from BIP 8.
i remember on BIP 2021 where they had a few people on the beach go to a party where there were new people for them to mingle with, and i really enjoyed that because it’s kind of the same concept but it was only for one night instead of a few days.
Honestly I don't like it for this show. It's already only 2 weeks long, they're expecting engagements at the end, and now they wanna reduce the amount of time people have together even further??
The casa amor twist would have worked if the girls weren't so weepy over the guys that they knew for barely a week. We need a better group of girls not obsessed with these mediocre men and open to getting to know other guys.
Unfortunately on BIP, it translated into "Casa a-bore"
It’s so fun on Love Island, but it was not fun on BIP.  They used it as an opportunity to torture the women for drama and it wasn’t fun to watch.   I think it could be improved by making the men leave instead (they usually have the guys go to Casa Amor in Love Island). They should also send them to a resort that looks more like where BIP is filmed so it doesn’t feel so different & it’s more comfortable for everyone. They know who contestants are interested in and they need to bring in at least 1 viable match for each contestant. I think it could be better if they did those things, but idk it will always be bad if their goal is to film as many emotional breakdowns as possible.
I hope not. It was not executed well at all. I hope they start having challenges of some sort to decide who goes on dates.
I doubt it, it wasn’t well received last year, and a lot of the contestants complained on social media when those episodes aired.   and it seems like this year they want to take the franchise back to basics. Judging by how they advertised Zach’s season as “Classic Bachelor”, and they chose to just have one Bachelorette again. So I don’t see any twists in format happening this year.
It was a big bust, so I doubt it.
I hope not. It didn’t seem like anything really came of it because the women refused to participate lol. It just seemed like a lot of wallowing.
I want to see survivor-like partner challenges for things like date cards or fantasy suite date nights
i hope not it was pointless
They’ll just steal a different idea from another dating show.
They better freaking not
I hope not. And I actually like casa amor bur it’s a love island thing. It felt like the bachelor was just stealing material and it wasn’t even that good. Bachelor contestants are too afraid of the fanbase for true chaos like love island
BIP filming isn’t long enough for a successful casa amor/split week. I didn’t like it last year but I love it for LI…
I think it could have worked if the girls had played along and got involved. There was nothing wrong with the extra men they got there, but instead they just moped and whined.
Is there an option for I hope not 😭
Yes but make the men leave this time
If they are going to do it again, it needs bombshells bombshells. Last seasons cast that they brought in was not it
I think they will do some twist, but I desperately hope not.
It doesn’t work due to all the pre-arrangements and general fakeness that BIP has become.
They need to do it earlier in the season for it to be successful imo
I wouldn’t be a surprised if a lot of the big names they want for this season negotiate that they’ll only go to the beach if they don’t do split week again. The audience didn’t seem to enjoy it either, so I don’t think they have much motivation to do it again.
I didn’t mind it that much. It wasn’t great for the relationships though so if they want to act like it’s about love they probably shouldn’t do that. We did get jill and her crystals and Andrew and Aaron swimming together from it though and that was pretty funny
If they do, it better be for two days MAX.
I hope not. I don't watch love Island by it is my understanding that it actually works on there as opposed to the shit show that was last year's bip. If they do it, then I hope they reconsider the format and change it up.
It added a lot of drama. I like it
It was such a faillll lol
They need to. I liked it and it bought drama. The last season wasn’t great, but it would have been terrible without Casa
That would be crazy, weren’t split week kind of early on in the season? If they stretched out four days for that many episodes it would absolutely explain why this season was a pain in my behind and why I lost interest before the finale 😅
I think they need a better crop of guys for the twist. Alex and Tyler were the only good ones. Adam the Australian seemed cool but none of the girls were going to go for a guy they don’t know that lives on another continent.
I think it would go a long way that the men would now know that the women aren’t sitting around waiting on them. If both groups know there will be new options around they will behave differently.   This last season the men thought they could do anything since the women would have no options. And the women went into it focused on the men’s response to the new women.
They should steal the Perfect Match idea for selecting who comes to the beach next. I always hated how random it is and that nobody can come back.
I think it’s hard to bring in major players later in the process, because people know that their chances of forming a successful relationship and getting good screentime go way down after like Week 2. A lot of the more popular people have the power to tell production that if they aren’t an early arrival, they aren’t going, so you end up with the people who have the least bargaining power coming in late.
The problem is that the people who are going to be the most desirable aren't going to agree to come in for Casa since it's the worst position to enter the show in. It's different on Love Island because everyone is an unknown quantity but the real power players in the BN franchise are the ones with clout, who will negotiate earlier entrances.  I mean, last year they had Alex freaking Bordy and he was doggy-paddling in the pool by himself, so I don't think it's an issue of them not sending in hot enough folks to turn heads, it's just that clout is the thing that makes contestants most desirable on the beach and people like Becca or Nayte or Michelle will know that they don't have to be a Casa reject.
I feel this way too! Theyll only go to paradise if split week doesnt happen.
Most of the big names from Katie, Michelle, and Clayton’s seasons got their chance at Paradise already. All the drama contestants from Gabby and Rachel’s season were also on the beach last year.   I think it’ll primarily be Gabby and Rachel’s top 6, Zach’s girls, and Charity’s guys.
I agree - how were the women even supposed to be tempted by the B team?? I know Alex is really good looking but his season was on forever ago, I don’t feel like he’s that hot of a commodity and Tyler was fresh off of Rachel/Gabby’s season so none of the women knew who he was.
What about Rick? I didn't get his appeal but I thought the sub loved him?   The girls were lame. Gen and Jill were unsufferable. Serene was boring the whole season. Shanae and Brittany were the only sort of interesting ones. Come to think of it, this show has gotten boring in general. BIP lost its sparkle. The last good season was in 2019, hence my username. 🤣 I might head over to the LIB or Vanderpump sub for a while to get my drama fix lol.
Yeah I mean “big” is a relative term here lol. I do think people like Aven, Nayte, Gabi, Ariel, Jess, Brooklyn, Kat, Blake Moynes if they can get him, and any former leads like Rachel, Michelle, Gabby, or even Clayton would be priorities for them though.
Gabby and Rachel’s top 6? I don’t think Jason will go, Zach obvi won’t go, Johnny was there last season, so you’re thinking Erich, Tino, and Aven?
Rick sucks and definitely exposed how much he sucks recently by being an Erich stan.
I can kiiiind of understand with Adam because if you're looking for a serious relationship it's tricky to start off living on different continents, but damn, you don't wanna go down under for the summer for a man who looks like that? Absolutely could not be me.
Probably Aven, Meatball, Tyler Round 2, Spencer, Ethan, and Floppy Hair Nate at least  Erich is probably blackballed after the blackface thing, unless he’s willing to do a sit down with Dr. Kira Banks (from WTA) to discuss it.   Tino will probably be invited but the ball is in his court, whether he wants to try again after his relationship with Rachel ended due to his infidelity.
Isn't Tyler an Erich bestie too though? They got matching tattoos and practically skipped around holding hands in that Tik Tok. Why does he get a pass?
Tino posted with a new girlfriend not long ago so I'd be surprised if he went. I think Erich is still dating that model.   Johnny alluded that he might be going back on one of his IG lives.
He doesn’t get a pass. I think he sucks in real life but he at least has a personality that made split week interesting.
No classy person I know would every tweet “classless piece of shit” in any context, even if justified. Sometimes if you don’t have anything good to say, don’t say anything. But, I’m not surprised. I wonder if he comments the same about guys like Draymond Green (if you don’t know, he’s an NBA player known to stir up drama/fights).
Huge green flag, for men AND women, is hating Dave Portnoy. Not enough people hate him! #onebiteyoureugly
The number one response to the tweet lol  https://preview.redd.it/zr19pwiw1rra1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d4964028f6072cb3fdb8f77d3c412d3b5d53698c
Let these women talk their trash! It’s a basketball game, not midnight mass
Portnoy and Barstool are terrible. It’s ridiculous how many BN people go on CITO for interviews. The man is racist, sexist, and has been accused of sexual assault. He’s still very much involved with all of those Barstool shows, so why support such a trash brand?
I HATE Portnoy and love Rachel & Angel, but if “no u” classifies as a dunk we need to reevaluate lmao
who is dave portnoy to be talking about class lmao
One of the best pieces of advice that I ever saw on this sub was that if a potential partner tells you that they idolize this man to take a good hard look at them. lol   On a side note, with all the scandals this guy has, I'm surprised an exposé/major reckoning hasn't happened with his company yet. They must have some really good lawyers.
Caitlin hasn’t even said anything about it though?! I’m pretty sure she understands it’s just trash talk she does it too lol, people getting mad on her behalf are weird when she hasn’t shown any hard feelings 😭😭😭   Angel did nothing wrong, yeah I guess it was a bit too much following her around, but it’s part of the game 🤷🏽‍♀️. Both are great players and balled out, these grown ass man need to please stfu, one minute their hating women sports the next they are passionately criticizing a player 😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫
I fucking hate Portnoy so much
I shocked at some of these comments!   Why do we expect college level athletes to be calm and composed when they win the national title? Let then trash talk, especially at someone whose been trash talking all playoffs. She made a silly gesture which is the same gesture Caitlin had made. Caitlin herself even said she didn’t notice.   Do we get upset when Klay Thompson counts his rings? This is such a silly thing for people to be getting up in arms over, but I know the two main reasons they are.
His handle is stoolpresidente and he's calling someone else a piece of shit?
Calling a young woman a classless piece of shit is too absurd and this man, who has proved HE is the classless piece of shit, is backing this stance like his life depends on it.
Caitlin made it clear today Angel should not get any criticism   https://twitter.com/espn/status/1643311621861949441?s=46&t=JH9Pa7IP4qU76d2NwhEbmg
As is usually the case,  the truth lies somewhere in the middle.     First up-  there’s 100% some subtle racism and dog whistling with the criticism of Angel and anyone who pretends otherwise is naive or disingenuous.   And it’s not only Portnoy.  There’s a lot of media members and fans doing it right now.   It’s disappointing but not really surprising.     Secondly-  Caitlin Clark has absolutely been a trash talker and made gestures all season.  It’s only fair that she gets some it back.  Theres some validity to the argument that it’s usually not specifically directed at an opposing player but generally at ramping up the crowd.  BUT she is not some quiet innocent bystander and I guess to her credit she doesn’t pretend to be.  She didn’t seem to have much of an issue after the game yesterday with LSU.     Thirdly -  Angel literally followed Caitlin around for 20 sec taunting her with 5 sec in the championship game. It was mean spirited and she definitely took it too far in the emotions of the moment.  It’s completely fair to not like it and think it’s classless on some levels.    LSU’s coach has questionable character and there’s always been talk about the kind of team environment and morals she puts out there.   But the level of vitriol is overblown for the above mentioned reasons.
I’m just happy to see people talking about women’s sports
Where do these men get the audacity?
https://preview.redd.it/d8qmxuadsqra1.jpeg?width=1093&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6965ea890e6b3dd80a35245c9de5f6a6a6a09771  Men are so emotional.
I don’t understand. Why is it okay for John cena to do that gesture but not any of them? I just read an article on the situation and I basically have no idea why it’s even a situation
Here's a 12 minute video of John McEnroe losing his temper:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlGZmJrBtNc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlGZmJrBtNc)  He does everything from yelling at the refs, threatening the refs, threatening the other player, breaking his racket, and overall just getting pissy.  He's described as "passionate" and someone who "wants to win"  &#x200B;  ETA: Black women already go through a lot of shit in American society. It does not bother me seeing a Black woman own her talent. Perhaps people who are offended should work on getting more confidence, instead of claiming Angel did something wrong.
Dave Portnoy is definitely a supreme asshole, and glad Rachel told him off, but still have no fucking clue as to what's going on here. Or why this post has almost 300 comments. Also keep in mind that I am not a sports fan AT ALL (so I don’t keep up with this stuff).
Why is the internet trying to ruin trash talking in women’s sports? Can these women enjoy themselves without the racism and misogyny? Ugh.
I’m an iowa fan and this loss hurttt, I’m not a fan of taunting when it’s the end of the game just to rub salt in the wound, but the reactions have been atrocious towards angel reese. Why do women’s sports need to be ‘classy’? They’re passionate athletes. (But also, the reffing was horrendous. To me, it ruined the championship game.)
Successful male athletes are allowed and accepted to be cocky and arrogant and it’s just “part of the game” but the second a woman does the same……
It's in the name. He's the president of stool.
I don’t watch reality tv for displays of class and same goes for sports. And I think it’s an dumb quality to be measuring people by anyway.  If class means that I’m behaving in a way that a 64 yr old man approves of, then they can keep it.
The owner of Barstool Sports has something to say about class. lmao  Joe Scarborough from MSNBC made a similar stupid ass tweet like this last night. They are both morons
Men:  ![gif](giphy|5wNLa3G1ZcF92Ap9m3)
Why is Angel catching so much flack when Caitlin did it to a different team? I know two wrongs don’t make a right but geeeez can we just let them enjoy their win
My problem with this whole situation is the level of vitriol and disgusting comments coming mostly from middle age, garbage white men like Portnoy and Keith Olberman, aimed at Angel Reese. Not that this behavior is in anyway surprising or new to Black women - specifically black female athletes; and if you think this is not the case then Serena, Naomi Simone and even Flojo (Yes, she’s passed on but iykyk) would like a word.   Whether Caitlin did it first or to whom she did it to, is beside the point. Girlfriend is a tough competitor and gets in her opponents ass - as she should. She’s no shrinking violet that needs her honor defended by the likes of most of these POS that have no honor themselves. This situation is yet again just another dog whistle to racist misogynist looking for any excuse to call a black woman out of her name.
This is why I’ll continue to think anyone who likes Barstool is trash. Racist from the top down.
Dave Portnoy is in his mid 40s and there's multiple confirmed accusations of him playing out rape fantasies with 19 year olds. No one should listen to anything he says.
Portnoy is the worst.
Huge fan of Iowa and of Caitlin Clark here. I didn’t *love* Angel following Caitlin around for like 20 seconds and taunting her, but yeah. It’s been blown way out of proportion, and assholes like Portnoy are using it to fuel the angry black woman stereotype. Caitlin absolutely talks shit too. I’m sure she can handle someone doing it to her.
I assume Dave Portney gets this upset when male athletes (white males in particular) trash talk? Right??
What makes a grown man think it’s ok to bully A COLLEGE KID? He’s disgusting.
I just think its hilarious the sudden need to be “classy” in sports but I will bet if she lost and cried or something they would say she needs to toughen up and not be a baby. The goal post always moves. Dave Portnoy is racist sexist (insert every -ism/-ic) trash.
 "Unapologetically confident young women should be celebrated NOT hated," she added. "Get used to it." - Angel Reese     Probably my favorite quote from her during the whole debacle. I liked that she stood her ground.
I hate Dave Portnoy with a burning passion, he wrote an entire article about my guy friend who played on a woman’s field hockey team in Massachusetts. He was being misogynistic and homophobic in the entire article. My friend was not even 18 when that article was written about him. I literally hate him so much Dave Portnoy can kick rocks
I don't get the criticism. In the NBA I see the "too small" gesture and others super often. It's funny when they do it. But when a woman and especially a *black* woman does it..there's a problem? These people are elite athletes..I think cockiness comes with the territory. Let them be cocky!! It's deserved!
Jesus Christ- you can dislike what she did but “classless piece of shit”??? So gross.
I commented “fucking a” on the rangers sub when we lost a game we should’ve played better in. I got asked if I was a Barstool fan and I’ve never been so insulted and other people immediately stood up for me when I said fuck that noise. Cause fuck that noise and fuck Portnoy. Good on big Rach
Where is the outrage for Catilin doing the same to a South Carolina player?  I can't wait for Catilin to meet the Las Vegas Ace team on the court in 2024 or 2025  ![gif](giphy|h3cYGcGMzdTcxBqOiz)
Who wants “class” in sports. I want real hate on the court. Gimme some brawls and brouhahas, none of that handshake and happiness mumbo jumbo. It’s good for the game
His twitter feed looks like Trumps right now with all the #Classless tweets. He makes me fucking sick. What a dumb asshole piece of shit.
And this is why Rach will always be my fav
Me to Rachel Lindsay:  ![gif](giphy|ZeINRh9Vj3kTT6True)
“No, you” isn’t really a dunk, but Portnoy is garbage for a million different reasons and I will always support people getting after him.
anyone who calls someone classless likely has zero class
Only white women are allowed to make the hand gesture. It’s cute and funny when they do it, and rude and garish when black women do it. Fucking double standards.
The nerve of an alleged sexual assaulter/mediocre white man/looks-like-he-smells-all-the-time individual to call an athlete classless for a harmless gesture. Especially when similar claims are never made against male athletes (or Caitlin Clark earlier this week for that matter) for their actions in the midst of a competitive atmosphere.
porkboy
People on this sub are obsessed with bringing topics to this sub that the people here don’t have the range to discuss.  Why am I being subjected to terrible, uninformed opinions on Angel Reese and Caitlin Clarke on a sub about The Bachelor?? Because Rachel Lindsay replied to a tweet? Please BFFR.
I’ve been an LSU fan since I came out the womb and it’s been my lifelong dream to watch the lady tigers basketball win an NCAA championship.   That being said. I’m so tired of the discourse around Angel’s trash talking. First of all, she was very correct in saying if she was a man it wouldn’t even be a conversation. Second of all, Caitlin Clark has done PLENTY trash talking of her own. First telling an opposing player ‘you’re down by 15 points, shut up’. Then her dismissing an SC player and waving her off. Then SHE made that gesture first and apparently said some very rude things to Alexis Morris from our team. But this entire tournament the focus for her has been her (absolutely unbelievable) skill and performances.   But Angel Reese taunts and trash talks and all of a sudden she’s a classless piece of shit. No one talking about how she broke the double double record. No one talking about how LSU not only went to the championship for the first time in program history but WON. No one talking about how Kim Mulkey is the first woman coach to win multiple national championships at different schools.   Now why is that?
Funny, because Caitlin Clark did it first. Portnoy has no idea what he’s talking about.  https://preview.redd.it/szrlfzpzarra1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=869ca844009e525fb02a84a5f3e88c724e268bf8  When they say, “it’s not about race.” It’s usually about race. [https://www.npr.org/2023/04/03/1167704651/angel-reese-caitlin-clark-you-cant-see-me-gesture](https://www.npr.org/2023/04/03/1167704651/angel-reese-caitlin-clark-you-cant-see-me-gesture)
Oh man I used to talk to this kinda famous guy if you were into sports back in the day but stopped to start dating my current bf and my friends used to give my grief about it and always send me screenshots of what he was up to even though I didn't care. One day I find out he has a freaking barstool podcast now and I'm so thankful I dodged that bullet and am now with someone that doesn't like barstool at all.
I cannot wait to listen to tomorrow’s Higher Learning episode!  Van is going to be gleaming
The racism that I’m seeing in response to LSU is sickening. So Caitlin Clark can dish it out but not take it? I don’t care if Caitlin did it to her bench, it’s the same sentiment and she’s KNOWN for trash talk. Makes me upset how much media is running with this.
Rachel has faced so much misogynoir lately
Honestly this is why I had a lot of trouble hanging out with a lot of male dominated spaces(even as a guy). A lot of the hyper/toxic masculinity exists there, and I really don't want to hear someone talk about Dave Portnoy/Barstool/Joe Rogan/Jordan Peterson.  Either way Dave Portnoy is definitely a hypocrite. A Black woman taunting in sports is bothering him because she's a Black woman. I have no doubt if it was his favorite football team, he'd have no problem with it(and I know he's done that too). He's had a long racist streak, anti union behavior, sexist takes along with many other things.   &#x200B;  But when you have all the privilege and advantages and yet still end up as unimpressive as Dave Portnoy you lash out.
I just caught myself up on this. I still feel like I’m missing something though. So Angel did the same gesture back to Caitlin, but people are saying she did it for longer and more “in your face,” but the video clips I’m seeing it only seems like a few seconds? Am I not seeing the full clip? Or is it because Angel was on the winning team and that’s seen as especially disrespectful in the sporting world? To me “classless” seems like a pretty obvious dog whistle, whether it’s unconscious or not but I don’t understand the intricacies of sporting decorum.
Love that Portnoys lame ass isn’t verified on twitter.
i think two things can be true here (maybe even three lol). Caitlin Clark did a lot of shit talking and so did Reese. Maybe it’s not the most agreeable thing to continue to taunt the losing team for an extended period of time instead of celebrating with your team. But also treating black woman as aggressive or classless is a microagression rooted in racism. Dave is also not the best guy. So there we go three things are all true to where I think it’s not so clear cut whether LSU or Iowa should be supported. Rachel’s response was subpar at best lol. She definitely didn’t “dunk” but I see what she meant to do.  Overall the girls played a good game and they’re just kids. Let them play and then celebrate the achievements
daily reminder that tayisha’s zach is bff’s with this guy 🙃🙃

Was happy to see Rachel and Van call this pos out last night
He is literally so gross!
Honestly, I wasn’t okay with what Angel did, there’s a difference between trash talking during the game versus trash talking after winning. It’s just not good sportsmanship. But I understand it was probably a heat of the moment thing and emotions were so high, and she’s what, 22 years old?   That being said, Dave is like in his late 40s and is an asshole. Couldn’t agree more with Rach. He wouldn’t have tweeted that about a white man and we all know it.
Love her
I hope this ends him. He truly is the worst, classless piece of abusive shit.
Dave is such a toolbag
She ate that
Boycott Portnoy
On one hand, taunting/trash talking is a bit of a red flag.  On the other hand, Portnoy has sexual misconduct allegations against him, so he shouldn’t be schooling anyone on what appropriate behavior is, especially a woman. since he clearly doesn’t have the first clue himself.
What did she do? Dave sucks either way
I’m not a huge Rachel fan but this made me love her. Dave Portnoy is the worst.
Im not a huge Rachel fan but this is pretty funny, I gotta say.  👍👍👍
This isn’t enough. I need Portnoy on Rachel’s pod so she can expose him for the fraud he is
Damn I use to like his lil pizza reviews too 🥲

Keep going.

Porque no los dos?
💯 . You’re saying this…on Twitter…about a young college student. Regardless of her actions, the man needs to reasses
THIS! Exactly what I was going to say. The blatant racism and sexism of this whole debacle are just astounding. Not shocking. But astoundingly disappointing, just the same.
I’d say it about Trump. 😂
Considering he is a racist POS, I won't be suprised if he also says the same about Draymond. But now Luka Doncic on the other hand, these people would be falling all over themselves to praise him for the same behavior
You had me for second lol. I had reread it haha
Anything related to the Barstool brand is beyond toxic, including the endless slew of podcasts.
when I was on the apps before I met my fiance I would make sure to allude to barstool early on in the messaging phase to get a read on guys.
And it’s clear that’s part of the game. Caitlin wasn’t crying about it, she’s talked her shit too!
Right, I think people separate it from barstool because it’s seemingly liberal women doing the pod but that’s the whole problem! Women being out at the forefront to distract from the misogyny, it’s gross. It’s a very white feminism thing to do and I hate it!!!
I gained a lot of respect for Clare and Tayshia for refusing to go on and be associated with that brand
Do you think Ria and Fran are racist, sexist, and are pro-sexual assault? I’m not disagreeing at all with your sentiment on Portnoy but you should be able to separate him from CITO and can consume their content without a guilty conscience. I assume you watch Disney but don’t care for the misconduct of multiple past CEOs or Walt Disney himself. The same can be said for many many media companies (among other businesses) that you consume daily.
I'm not clever enough to come up with good titles 🥲
looking at you Zac Clark 😒
There have been exposes but no one seems to care. His followers are all rapists like him and will obliterate anyone on social media who criticizes him. So much of his support is on social media, which is very different than someone like Harvey Weinstein who’s biggest supporters are boomers who don’t know how to weaponize their hate in the modern age.
There was one. I think he ended up like live on Twitter or something breaking down the article and the allegations. I didn’t watch it but that live was a thing on twitter for a day and then people moved on.
as somebody who consumes Chicks in the Office and other Barstool podcasts I’m generally aware of what Dave is up to. He has had a lot of media trying to expose him but they end up fairly empty handed. He’s not secretive about that. He actually recently tried to sue business insider bc of a hit piece they wrote. He was totally willing for lawyers to dig through his background to show that business insider was lying which takes a lot of balls. We saw how the Amber/Depp trial exposed both of them as toxic despite having great lawyers. Not a comment or acceptance of his character, I just think if after so many years of people trying to take him down, maybe there’s not as much of a smoking gun there like we all think. Still not the best person ever but idk it’s sorta neutral to me now.
> these grown ass men need to please stfu  FOR REAL. These losers haven’t played a meaningful athletic game in their lives. They can zip it.
I literally cut my cousin’s wife out bc we had an argument and she was ride or die defending him.  It was when he was soliciting donations during Covid then taking credit like he was the one donating the money from his own pocket.  God, I hate him.
why has this never clicked in my head😭😭😭
LSU’s coach is the women’s game version of Rick Pitino with some added homophobia as a bonus. Happy for the LSU players but Kim Mulkey can fuck all the way off.
love to find the most nuanced take on this on bachelor reddit lol
Yes!!! 100% agree with you on all of this.
Absolutely.  I’m personally really annoyed that all of the viral videos I’ve seen are of displays of poor sportsmanship by a coach and multiple players. Heaven forbid the media highlight the actual talent of these incredible players like they do with the men—they’re too busy making sure the entire women’s league looks petty and “emotional” instead.
Caitlin’s was definitely directed at individual players - specifically I think Angel had said it was in response to one of Caitlin’s comments telling her opponent to shut up you’re down 15 at the final four game and the gesture for telling her opponent I’m giving you ground to take a 3. And she definitely has a history of it - the story is very unclear about what happened on her brother’s team but she definitely taunted opponents about getting beat by a girl.  It’s hard to separate racism from the affinity for Caitlin - most of the people I know who knew anything about NCAAW knew Caitlin and LSU’s coach. So attacking their favorite player = gets hate. Now did the fact she is white also lead to her media attention etc. leading to that visibility? Most likely.   Also no matter what people feel about LSU’s coach - she did go over to Caitlin after the game to tell her she is generational talent.
It’s more than just subtle racism. These fools have megaphones.  I don’t really get this argument that she shouldn’t have done this at the end of the game. It’s never a bad time to flex on your opponent in the national championship game. They won and she’s letting her know, it’s all in good fun.  It’s also really not mean-spirited nor is it a character problem. It’s typical sports showboating. Men in college and professionally act like this and people love it because part of sports *is* the trash talking, the gloating, this kind of entertainment.  I don’t like Mulky either but what Angel did isn’t a Mulky instilling poor character thing. This is Angel. She talks shit. That’s the type of ball environment she grew up in. There’s nothing wrong with it. Angel has given Caitlin her props, she’s never being malicious.
It’s just college kids being cocky dumbass college kids. March Madness is a hell of a lot of adrenaline and it’s not like she followed her around flipping the bird and screaming. I’ve seen way worse from professional players.
Yeah, I noticed that and I wasn't thrilled when I saw it. Curious if that will hurt her chances at WNBA. FWIW, I would have absolutely had the same reaction if this were a male player.
i agree with you on everything except for people calling it classless. it’s a garbage racist and misogynist term
>Theres some validity to the argument that it’s usually not specifically directed at an opposing player but generally at ramping up the crowd  Like when she told Hailey Van Lith to "*shut the fuck up,* you're down 15" or when she shoo-ed Raven Johnson mid game I guess those weren't specific players huh?   &#x200B;  > It’s completely fair to not like it and think it’s classless on some levels  It's not. & I wish cupcakes who think this way would stop watching sports bc they're ruining it for those of us who love competition. Athletes at the highest levels get to that point bc of their hypercompetitiveness & forcing them to dilute that for unwritten rules of "class" is lame.
I legit think some men are mad that the women’s tournament has more of a following than the men’s this year.
✨racism and misogyny ✨
Excellent point John McEnroe is someone who didn't receive criticism for his on-court antics, really astute comparison.
> It does not bother me seeing a Black woman own her talent.   Trash talking, I thought her talent was basketball? Putting her on a pedestal for trash talking? Don't try to spin this into some positive character trait. It's almost as bad as the people who are attacking her. It's trash talk, nothing more, let's move on.
Women’s national basketball championship game. Caitlin Clark is one of the best, if not the best, college basketball players right now and plays for Iowa. She did the “can’t see me” move towards her bench in a previous game and also waved off an opposing player from South Carolina in a previous game in a “don’t need to guard her” kind of way.   Angel Reese plays for LSU and didn’t like the move Caitlin pulled against South Carolina, she made a comment about it on social media or in the press. (That’s a weird SEC thing, they take particular offense whenever anyone non-SEC team disrespects conference teams.) LSU beat Iowa and Angel decided to talk her shit. Some people defending her because sports winners get to talk their shit logic, some hating it because it’s “classless,” not really a one-to-one to what Caitlin did.  Dave Portnoy bet on Iowa and thus upset. He says controversial stuff so he knows how to get the Rachel Lindsay’s and Jemele Hill’s to respond. His classless piece of shit comment is pretty rich considering he’s a Boston sports fan. That fan base and Boston teams have shoen themselves to have plenty of classless sports moments in the past couple of decades.  Caitlin’s not the first basketball player to “disrespect” an opponent by sagging off of them (see Russell Westbrook, Ben Simmons being defended in the NBA) Angel’s not the first to shit talk after winning or doing the see my ring to an opponent (see Travis Kelce, Luka Doncic, Klay Thompson). Dave Portnoy shit posts on the athletes he doesn’t like or bets against. This just has an added layer of having some racial biases because of the players involved but those have largely been from media and online reactions. The women’s tournament this year has had a lot of athlete-driven moments of players or teams shit talking. So all in all, it’s probably all been a net positive for exposure in this year’s women’s season because the championship game broke viewership records.
kim mulkey on the court pushing the ref not getting a T and caitlin getting one for tossing the ball was preposterous
Fuck those refs I'll die mad
I don't like when men do it either. Like when you've clearly won, why do you still need to act like that? Just enjoy your win.  Not defending Portney, obviously. Calling someone a classless POS is uncalled for.
In professional sports you're totally right, male athletes get away with it all the time. But in college basketball this type of thing generally gets the same reaction on the mens side too. When FAU was beating Fairleigh Dickinson with 10 seconds left, and while everyone else had accepted that the game was over and were standing around letting the clock run out, a FAU player took off and tried to do a fancy dunk as time expired, and the sports world was at the guys throat for the lack of sportsmanship.     Even in the pros most fans/media members don't like it when players are unnecessarily cocky and mean spirited after a win. There are a lot of things that are wrong about the responses to the game, but I don't think it's surprising that fans/media are upset at a player for doing what Angel did after the game, that's something that is generally disliked in all sports.
🏆
Because she is a black woman. It’s fucking nonsense. I was a university athlete and you trash talk
Keith Olbermann saying anything became even more wild when he followed up his tweets with the fact he doesn’t even watch basketball as a whole, at all.
Yup and have to include the Chicks in the Office in that group!
The chokehold this guy has on 30-45 year old men is so gross
Also an Iowa fan and agree. The only thing that continues to confuse me is LSU’s insistence that CC disrespected them? I didn’t see any of that so I assume it was one of those things a coach drills into your head to get your psyched for a game, but who knows.
This is what enraged and hyped up Alexis Morris. She was saying the way Clark waved off the perimeter shooting was disrespectful and that they would have to guard LSU’s shooters differently. Came to fruition when LSU 3-point shooters had a heyday. I think LSU just continued the disrespect argument all the way through their game around all aspects of Iowa’s play in order to keep up the hype. https://news.yahoo.com/caitlin-clarks-very-disrespectful-defense-205026911.html
There's the same double standard for women in tennis, and probably a million other things. Women can't get upset the way men can in sports.
ya he regularly calls out draymond green for being a dirty player and classless
Because the only people he hangs out with (and sleeps with) are college kids. He’s perpetually stuck at age 21, and the worst kind of 21-year-old too
Or use the image of her crying everywhere in perpetuity like they did with Aliyah Boston
Yeah I was switching between this and the bruins game, where there were multiple fist fights lol. Not even saying that that’s classless behavior (because I love to watch hockey fights) but how do you call this classless and not that? I thought taunting the other team was a pretty standard thing!
To be fair Reese does the too small gesture every time she scores and no one says anything. She does stuff like this every game. The issue with this specifically was that she followed Caitlin around after the game was over when Caitlin was trying to go to the bench and then followed it up with social media posts. I’ve never seen that happen in men’s sports tbh.
Lol no. Nobody cares about shit talk during the game. People don’t like that she did it after they destroyed Iowa and the game was over and followed Caitlin around the court mocking her.
Has barstool made people believe they came up with “fucking a”? Jeez
She could be playing for them!  She has no issue with what happened.  Let’s not put the blame where it doesn’t belong.  This is on white men in the media.
Exactly. Just wait for the big leagues when the taunting and shit talking is way worse. The outrage over this is ridiculous on both sides. The men do it all the time and no one says shit.
💪💪let’s go
Didn’t Caitlin Clark do the gesture first? (I’m trying to catch up on this whole thing)
ayyyy fellow foot soldier 🫡
Man. I don't know who forced you to click and read the post but I'm sorry you don't have the free will to completely overlook something you're not interested in looking at in the first place. Sounds pretty rough.
![gif](giphy|KvAKXViNfpU8fSDiF0|downsized)
Personally I think that as long as there’s no bigotry involved and no one is getting hurt, we should just let athletes talk their shit. They’re all adults, and honestly I kind of love the added drama that comes with a little personality conflict.
Iowa Fan here.  First congratulations on your win.    Caitlin has shown zero issues with Reese.  She didn’t react on the court or in the post game interviews she can dish and take it.  It’s the media not her making a big deal of this.  I have no issues with either.  As for waving off SC, that wasn’t disrespectful.  That was facts, Caitlin wasn’t going to be drawn out of the middle to guard a player who couldn’t hit a 3.  She proved that by passing the ball vs taking an open shot she had seconds to aim and shoot for.  Refs sucked all around yesterday and Kim needs to stay off the court.  LSU shot lights out, congrats
and all these people are getting mad on Caitlin Clark's behalf like Reese mortally offended her when Caitlin hasn't even indicated she's bothered! They're athletes, they trask talk, they both give as good as they get, stop projecting your racism and misogynoir on to them
Kim Mulkey is terrible. She’s lucky no one is talking about her right now.
I think both things can be true.  Portnoy is out of his depth chiming in here especially being from Boston and the amount of trash talk Boston fans spew.  However there is ton of discourse all the time about sportsmanship in men’s sports.  Because kids watch the games and emulate the athletes. From not shaking players hands after the game (Isiah Thomas to MJ) or tom Brady after losses.  Richard Sherman had a huge rant after a game that was discussed.  To touchdown celebrations act like you been there before.  tdlr Portnoy should have been quiet and Reese did not have to go so hard on catlin clark after winning the championship
I am a casual LSU fan. I went to Texas, but in the SEC, I always liked LSU.   You made great points. LSU made a historic run and all I heard about all tournament was Caitlin Clark and LSU’s coaches wardrobe.   Honestly, if someone lost their cool for a minute or two after being ignored for three weeks and continually hearing about someone else, so what?   I am happy for LSU and women’s basketball, in a historic year they shone the brightest.
I think the outrage stems from her literally following Clark around doing it instead of celebrating for winning the championship lol. Nobody is saying Caitlin didn’t also do it. I think the argument is if Reese should’ve done it for that long and in that moment. People legit thought she was following Clark into the locker room lol. I think race plays a role but I don’t think people are saying Clark is this perfect angel who has never shit talked in her life
[removed]
Oh you know he’s going to be on one for sure and I here for all of it! 😂
Actually Caitlin was unbothered by it on the court and in the interviews after!  It was the media making a big deal of it, not Clark. She can dish and take it.   My issue yesterday was the refs.  Bad calls on both sides (but mostly against Iowa). they were atrocious, just let them play, and get Kim off the court!
I agree with you, but caitlin clark has said nothing negative about reeses taunting. It’s pretty bizarre how the media created a narrative that clark ‘can’t take it’ I think she just doesn’t care lmao.
Also, it’s ok when white women do it and when men do it but now there is outrage when a black woman does it? The racism and misogyny is strong.
I think the main takeaway is Caitlin was talking trash—she did the hand over face gesture and was caught on camera saying “you’re down 15 stop talking shit” to Hailey Van Lith (white girl on Louisville who also was her roommate for Team USA) and it went viral.   The next game Caitlin Clark and Iowa played South Carolina, a school in the SEC just like LSU and Angel Reese. In this game, Caitlin’s coach told her that when the (black) girl she is guarding has the ball, to stand in the paint/lane and give her tons of room to shoot. *this is common to do if a player can’t shoot. NBA teams did this to Rondo on the Celtics and teams do it to Draymond Green right now. My HS Coach had us do it sometimes if a kid on the other team was a bad shooter*   So anyways, LSU players in pre-game interviews the day before the big game were saying what she did was disrespectful to their fellow SEC girls. It wasn’t. It’s a coaching strategy and the girl couldn’t shoot and they won so it worked. That’s like saying doing a pick and roll on the other teams worst player is disrespectful. At the end of the game, Angel Reese, unprovoked by Clark, did the same you can’t see me gesture that Caitlin did to HVL but she did it for an extended period of time, when the game was over, and followed her around instead of celebrate with teammates. Caitlin Clark did it for 3 seconds in response to something that HVL said directly to her face.   Portnoy deserves all the shit being poured on him for calling her a POS and classless. However everyone else on social media saying this has to do with race.. it doesn’t. Caitlin Clark was never disrespectful to anyone and her taunting gesture was too another white girl for those that throw the race card out there. What Angel Reese did wasn’t because Caitlin was white either. It was an emotional moment in the biggest games of her career. Did Angel Reese take it way too far then Clark did? Yes. Was it much more poor sportsmanship than Clark’s? Yes, it was. But if you say any of that online and you’re going to be called a bigot. Or like the black Loyola college player who said just as much, they called him an Uncle Tom.   People need to chill with making everything about race and politics. It was a basketball game and what happens on the court stays on the court and you shake up afterwards. Some players can’t control their emotions at times and most fans don’t get the concept of trash talking is fine  EDIT: it’s been 30 seconds and I’ve gotten 2  downvotes. No one reads that fast! SMH
Angel did run after Caitln which is different than what Caitlin did.  But as I have said I have no issues with either, nor does Caitlin.  It’s the media.
Caitlin never did it to Angel. She did it to her friend of a decade who had done something similar to her earlier in the game, a week before the game against Angel.   The issue isn’t Angel did it. The first time she did it was fine. The second time she did it was highly unusual as she followed Caitlin as she was leaving the court when the game was over to do it in her face. And has spent the last two days posting about it o social media.   My personal take was that it was weirdo behavior that did get unfairly criticized because of race but now is being overly defended and categorized as normal by people rightly pushing against the racists.
That was it. Angel did that gesture for a few seconds near the end of the game. There was nothing more than that.     Travis Kelce after he beat the Cincinnati Bengals, insulted Joe Burrow, and told the Cincy mayor to "Shut your mouth and know your role"   [https://www.cincinnati.com/story/sports/nfl/bengals/2023/01/30/burrowhead-my-ass-its-mahomes-house-travis-kelce-trolls-cincinnati-after-afc-championship-win/69853014007/](https://www.cincinnati.com/story/sports/nfl/bengals/2023/01/30/burrowhead-my-ass-its-mahomes-house-travis-kelce-trolls-cincinnati-after-afc-championship-win/69853014007/)  &#x200B;  Guess how many people were upset at Travis Kelce
He did it on purpose.
This isn’t an LSU vs Iowa thing.  It’s the media.
20 and 21 year old women, not kids.
Ooof, yikers
Nothing will end him. Stoolies are like a cult.
His cis white male supporters dont give a shit unfortunately
How is it a red flag? Lol
omg no why would u want to put Rachel thru that
There’s a video of the girl Caitlin doing the exact same thing soooo
Anyone who says “classless” unironically is usually a gigantic asshole. Why is it classless for Angel to do it but not Caitlin? Trash talking is a part of the game. If you don’t like that and can’t handle it, you shouldn’t watch. Caitlin doesn’t have a problem with it, so why are you boohooing for her?   This discourse is so fucking dumb. Both these women are insanely good athletes, known for bringing their personality and passion on the court. One is allowed to express that freely, and one gets called “classless” for doing it. Both of them brought eyes to women’s sports because of these things.   Was Angel supposed to curtsy after her win? Put on a monocle and ball gown? It’s fucking basketball. Trash talk happens.
No she didn’t https://twitter.com/traek_/status/1642907280935903232?s=46&t=0nNa4Kh260fWywMFC1n_9w
Because Angel didn’t do anything wrong.
He needs to just stop talking.
Yeah I should start doing that! And barstool/Dave holds itself out to be politically liberal so these liberal men think it’s fine to like it, or they just don’t really think about it critically. Like remember when Dave spoke in support of roe v wade being law? People were commending him as if he’s Gloria Steinem. Babes he just wants abortions to be legal so he can fuck 19 year olds without worrying about child support. It’s the idea that liberal men see women as public property, conservative men see them as private property.
Right, Caitlin isn’t some injured bird. I’m sure she’s upset about losing, but doesn’t care about the trash talk.
I stopped separating them when Ria decided to defend Dave after the sexual assault allegations along with a few other women at the company.   https://twitter.com/BarstoolRia/status/1456351439463325701?s=20  It's my opinion, I'm not trying to argue about it. You're welcome to disagree.
Hahaha
Ewwww does he really?
He literally said "i never condone rape, but if you're a size 6 and you're wearing skinny jeans, you kind of deserve to be raped" and when asked about it again he doubled down and said he stands by it and thinks it's a funny joke.
Yikes “still not the best person ever” but ur still gonna support them? Lol
With he as the face of the barstool fund raised and provided over 40 million dollars for small businesses facing challenges from Covid.  If you can’t appreciate that is a good thing I don’t know what to tell you.    I am not a fan of barstool’s content, but it has women in high profile talent and management positions.   I swear people on this sub think it is more important for a person to make a social media post they agree with instead of real world impact that is way more significant.
This is the real problem. Can’t just talk about the game and the amazing athleticism we saw….girls = drama 🙄
I’ve seen the men in the NBA *and* the MLB (not to mention other sports) clear the benches for less. She beat out the crowd favorite, that’s as good a time as any to flex on ‘em.
Great comment /u/youngandconfused22
Y’all don’t know much about basketball if you think this is hurting her chances at the WNBA.
Clearly this person has never watched basketball. All these people upset with Angel would be HORRIFIED to hear the shit Michael Jordan would say on the court. Talking shit in basketball is a mind game that can help you win games.
The men’s still 200% has more of a following lol. The woman’s tournament had the most numbers out of any past years but it’s still around 50% of what the men’s get. I think men just have opinions on women bc they think they can not bc it’s an underlying jealousy/competition thing
Oh 100% it goes against their argument that no one watches women’s sports which is why it’s ok to pay women less money. But then some of the highest watched sporting events are women’s events (soccer, ncaa basketball, Olympics gymnastics…)
What? That's not true I don't follow college basketball but all the news I've seen has been men's. Like the other redditor said men's has much larger viewership too. I didn't even know LSU won til this thread.
100%
= Misogynoir 🖤
That is literally so infuriating, especially because it is SO blatant and obvious, yet I know they would deny it had anything to do with racism and misogyny.  ![gif](giphy|mF55wFqnBoBlSiVW6R)
In this John McEnroe tantrum, the crowd cheers him on:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmJi\_oc7t10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmJi_oc7t10)  If you read the comments they're praising him and talking about his passion. He got praised quite a bit for being competitive and wanting to win during his career. So yes, I did make the correct comparison.
Thank you!
It was wild. I wanted iowa to win just so Kim Mulkey didn’t get the win as well ! She drives me nuts haha
Tbh me too 😂
I agree I’m not a fan of that behavior no matter who does it - but the comparison has to be made imo
This. Caitlyn did that shit ALL THE TIME. My parents have floor seats for another big 10 team and I sat there watching Caitlyn try to get in a fight with a fan it was insane lol. She is the cockiest player I’ve seen and to watch someone else get flack for the same shit she does was obnoxious.
It’s giving clown behavior!
Yeah, I didn’t get that either. I guess she could’ve said stuff during the game that we didn’t hear, but everything I heard her say about LSU before the game was complimentary.
They never said she disrespected them. It was just 2 instances they found “disrespectful” in general is what I’m gathering from what the players said. The first being how Iowa guarded SC and imo the second being that they took down SC at all. I really think SC is who the players wanted to see in the ‘ship so they sort of took SC losing and how they were guarded personally.
I don’t know what was said or done to LSU players during the game but I do know that they took offense to the way Iowa disrespected other teams, particularly USC, which is another team of predominantly black women.
I don’t see how that was disrespectful to LSU, Iowa did guard LSU differently.  LSU can shoot 3s the player she waved off couldn’t.  SC had an open shot with time on the clock and passed the ball vs shooting.  Is it disrespectful to call out a fact?  And even if SC was upset, how did it affect LSU.  I don’t get this line of thinking.
Every team guarded South Carolina like that this season. This is a reach.
Dillon Brooks, Patrick Beverly and Draymond Green are trolls even after the game is over lol but I get it left a bad taste in peoples mouth and people may have the same sentiments with men doing it but it was amplified by her being a woman!
This is not really true. Angel has expressed how she’s been covered overall for even doing something as simple as that.  To say what Angel did isn’t in men’s sports is also not true.
Happens in sports when men play alll the time don't hear about it then
Oh sorry if I wasn’t clear- I mean he’s disgusting for saying that and he absolutely is one
RIGHT I’m from jersey I’ve been saying that since I could crawl, fucking a
She ain't playing for Vegas unless they have a losing record. The ACE is trying to repeat for the next two years.
Has she spoken up in defense of Angel? Or in defense of how common the shit talk is in general?
I’ve watched a lotttt of men’s college basketball and I’ve never really seen players follow the other team after a devastating lost mocking them.
She did it against another player on another team in an earlier round. People have been trying to distinguish it but honestly, it's just BS. Caitlin Clark loves to trash talk as much as anyone. There's only one MAJOR difference between her and Angel Reese when it comes to trash talking. IYKYK.  The fact that it's mostly mediocre assfaces like this guy arguing otherwise says everything.
Yes!! The hypocrisy here has been interesting to watch, but clearly not surprising considering.
family
You tried so hard to be clever. And failed. Better luck next time.
![gif](giphy|li0dswKqIZNpm)
I agree it makes it way more fun. Honestly I like it when athletes talk their shit, especially when they're in the zone. If you got it, you got it.
Oh same, I mean come on, the players themselves don’t get offended by the trash talking and they all dish and take it, so why is it such a big deal? It’s gotten ridiculous
Oh I totally agree! Sorry, I wasn’t trying to critique Caitlin Clark at all, rather the people who are showing their ass with the double standard. I see your point also about the waving off, fair enough. And yes those refs were TERRIBLE and I personally thought calling the tech on Clark was ridiculous. Kim always goes on the court and I can’t believe she never gets called for it, it is pretty crazy!
Nah you’re not gonna disrespect Kim. She’s passionate and gets heated but she has made a world of difference in those players lives and in women’s basketball in general. She gives credit where credit is due and is always very complimentary and respectful to the opposing teams and players. She made a point to go to Caitlin Clark yesterday and sing her praises which she did not have to do. She’s mouthed off some in the past and she’s apologized for it. She’s an incredible coach and I won’t hear any slander  Edit: well damn I took a nap and this blew up. 1. Kim was instructed by HER bosses not to speak on Brittany Griner & Russia. 2. I’ve never heard her say anything about being anti mask or supporting Trump, not since she’s been at LSU and I started paying attention to her at least 3. The only thing I’ve heard on her homophobia was that she didn’t want players being ‘out’ but she also coached at a private Christian college? Idk I’m judging her off what I’ve seen since she came to LSU and since she came here she’s been phenomenal.
Clark is a showboat. Her teammates made a video about her. That’s ok! It’s actually great because it elevates the game/competitiveness.   Women should be allowed to do it. Black women should be allowed to do it too. Portnoy is a jerk. Rachel is correct.
It’s still showboating during a game. It’s all about being cocky and showing up your opponent. I don’t think either woman did anything wrong, the media is just blowing this up for nothing.
That’s what’s killing me about all this. I’ve seen “if she can dish it she should take it!!!! 🤬” everywhere. She is taking it like a champ. Hasn’t said a peep. Too bad media literacy is fucking ass
I agree that the officiating was horrible but it was horrible both ways. The fouls were 18 LSU and 19 IOWA.  And that includes Clark's technical/personal foul for delay of game.  I think the officials had no idea who the teams that were playing. They should have been required to watch tape on the teams before officiating the game.  The story of the game should have been the epic battle between two teams rather than the consistently poor officiating.
Yes came here to say this. We see this in men’s sports all the time. But women are classless when they do it. That game yesterday was epic down to these moments. Women’s basketball is having a major moment and I love it so much! I’m here for all of it!
Yeah, it seemed like it wasn’t a big deal at all to Caitlin, so thought I was missing something. I kind of love what seems like pretty mild trash talking tbh!
She didn’t it twice. Once for a few second at the free throw line and then again for 12 seconds following Caitlin off the court. She has since posted pictures of her the ring Caitlin on social media for two days.
Thank you for the info and extra context!
Lol twitter was filled with people talking about how annoying Travis Kelce is, but also he didn’t do it in joe burrows face.
Oh! What do I know lol
It’s also a LSU v Iowa thing lol. People are picking sides by team- it can be both a media thing and a team thing
Lol yes I know It’s college basketball. It’s just a phrase to say “let the kids play” they aren’t professional athletes they are still just young ladies that don’t need to be harassed by the public.
She’ll chew him up and spit him out, she’d probably enjoy it tbh
Yes the media (beyond Dave) is making a big deal if it.  But I think it’s important to note Caitlin isn’t.  She can give it, and take it.  She didn’t say anything about it.
[removed]
I wasn't defending Caitlin.
Yes trash talking happens, doesn't make it sportsmanlike or classy.      I'm not "boohooing" for her, she can take it how ever she wants. But, we can still call out bad behavior.       > One is allowed to express that freely, and one gets called “classless” for doing it.      That's Dave Portnoy's opinion. We're only discussing this topic because Rachel L commented on his post. Majority of the people don't care about the trash talk.
Exactlyyyy. One telling thing is she didn’t react to Angel even as it went on. LOL. Just like the girls she shaded didn’t react to her!
oh yeah he's a big DP supporter. He notoriously wore a barstool sports shirt (and posted himself wearing it) like days after the SA allegations came out and then commented on DPs Instagram post where he addressed the allegations saying "Keep Going"  [Here's a thread on it](https://www.reddit.com/r/thebachelor/comments/qq5wl6/tw_zacs_comment_on_dave_portnoy_post/)
I literally said not a comment or acceptance of his character. I was merely replying to the statement that “he must have good lawyers” bc a major expose should’ve happened by now. People are trying and failing. Idk what that means but I don’t think it’s his lawyers because he usually waits for them to come out and doesn’t stop them before they hit the press
I don’t penalize the employees of the company he started for his mistakes. There are people who work there that don’t agree with him nor accept his behavior but have built huge platforms and make money there. I support their content bc I like it simple as that. I’m not out here buying Dave Portnoy merch. I would hate for a female’s career to be ruined by a man and I won’t contribute to that.
He also encouraged his followers to leave fraudulent negative reviews of a small business after the owner spoke out against him. He spreads misogyny and punishes anyone who has a problem with it. Some hero.
Yes but much more media attention than the men’s.  Point overall still stands.
To add to this. Yesterday’s game tickets sold for more than the men’s.
>soccer, ncaa basketball  where are you getting these numbers? I'm seeing 3.5 billion viewers for the men's WC final, 1.2 billion for the women's WC final. 15 million for the men's NCAA final, 10 million for the women's.
Yeah a lot of people loved his tantrums and a lot of people thought he was unsportsmanlike and inappropriate. He was a white guy who got a lot of support and a lot of hate. I don't think he is a good example of a white guy who got a free pass because of his behavior.
she's one of just the worst people in all of sports. bummer she coaches LSU, otherwise i'd have been super happy for them, but she's just the worst.
Agree
Classic rules for thee but not for meee.
CC the cockiest player “ever”… I don’t think so lol, sounds like some sour grapes to me
That’s, objectively, insane.
If they took Caitlin waving off the girl beyond the arc as disrespectful then I guess NBA players are all the time. Scouting report said she either couldn’t or wouldn’t shoot that 3 so CC didn’t feel the need to guard her. Playing smart is not disrespectful and certainly has nothing to do with race, unless we’re talking about another incident I wasn’t aware of.
I want to learn, how did Iowa disrespect SC?  I truly don’t see not guarding against a 3 she didn’t even try for as disrespectful.  She gave them plenty of space and time to make the shot.  It happens in the NBA all the time.
Yeah. I think you are into something here and this backs up the hype argument. I’m very aware of how Mulkey operates, so there is a line of thinking here that doesn’t have to make sense - it just comes from a coach who knows how to motivate her players.
Omg did she literally wave someone off, that’s hilarious. Honestly I’m enjoying the swag these women have
No argument here that the hate was amplified by her being a woman, specifically a black women. At the same time, I stopped following men’s sports because of behavior like the guys you mentioned above so I’m torn.
Shit talking during game is different than shit talking after you destroy the other team. I watch a ton of sports that situation is for sure not the norm.  Most coaches don’t put up with that.
I fully misread your original comment and thought you said he instead of she/were taking offense to Rachel calling him a classless piece of shit -- deleted, my apologies!
I know but the point is she won’t have an issue with them.  She knows it’s part of the game.  Your post implies the opposite.
Not post game, but in those interviews it hadn’t blown up yet.  But she was unphased post game, when asked about it.    But she spoke about it post SC mentioning Angel specifically.  And yes mentions it’s part of the game.  https://twitter.com/tify330/status/1642898398524186625?s=20  ETA:  so back to my point let’s not pit the two women against each other when it’s (mostly) white men making it an issue and for sure neither of the 2 involved are.  2nd edit:  one of many quotes from todays press from Caitlin   "I don't think Angel should be criticized at all. No matter which way it goes, I don't think she should be criticized for what she did. ... She competed ... Everybody knew there would be trash talk in entire tournament. It's not just me and Angel."  https://twitter.com/espn/status/1643311621861949441?s=46&t=JH9Pa7IP4qU76d2NwhEbmg

I think that was you, but its okay. We're all wrong sometimes. :)
I went to Baylor & attended many basketball games during my time there. Yes, Kim is an iconic coach who really can put a team together. But I feel you may have blinders on. Kim pushes boundaries - a lot. The way she screams in the refs faces, stomps angrily on the court (even bumping the officials multiple times in just the game yesterday), is not ideal. I've always been confused how she manages to not get technicals for her behavior - many other coaches immediately get penalized for the same thing. Additionally, she coached Griner while at Baylor. I understand having different viewpoints, but the fact that Kim couldn't say a single positive thing about BG or that she's in her thoughts or she's hoping it works out for her or she's sorry to hear about the situation, etc etc, speaks volumes on character. BG was a record breaker and together she & Kim really propelled themselves (rightfully so) and earned hella respect. To seemingly not give a hoot about that individual when they are in a scary situation is hella weird. Again, I am assuming as I can only go off what Kim publicly shows. But remember, people pick what they choose to show you publicly. And her actions make her look a bit selfish and uncaring.   I did appreciate the respect and kind words she has had for opposing teams players. Just wish she had the same decency for some of her previous players. That helped her get the job she has today.
She’s a notorious homophobe who couldn’t even speak positively about Brittany Griner. No thanks.
She’s passionate about her homophobia, that’s for sure.
yes please don’t disrespect my anti-mask, trump supporting coach who leaves her star player out to dry in Russian prison because she’s gay! she wins us championships, so who cares 😍
> Nah you’re not gonna disrespect Kim.  the woman who wanted covid testing to end, to the point that she said even if players were positive they should stay? the woman who is an obvious homophobe?   the woman who refused to show any support to griner when she was arrested in russia despite everything griner did for kim's career?  well damn why don't you tell on yourself a little more.
Absolutely Caitlin talks just as much shit on the court. There is a lot of documentation of this just like there is of Angel, and you know what, good on them if they want to. These women, at this moment, are next level. They are elevating women’s basketball in a way that women’s sports have never been recognized- let them build this out in their way because they seem to have alllll the haters attention now.
Portnoy ultimately is run by his bets and is upset bc he bet on Iowa and LSU won. If he had bet on LSU he would be in favor of Reese lol. He’s not a complex human
Exactly!  She can dish and take.   I think yesterday was the first time many here have watched Clark.  She taunts (after being taunted) then backs it up.  Crowd yells “over rated to her”. She motions bring it on, then backs it up by having a 40+ point triple double in the Elite Eight.  First time ever for a man or woman to do that in the tournament.     All many here are seeing are clips of her taunting not the fact that she backs it up.  Yesterday was a down day and she still scores over 30 points
They've reffed multiple games of both teams before lol
Tom Brady threw threw his helmet and tablet (causing it to break) during a game and he was idolized for "caring about the sport"
Since when were athletes expected to be "classy" anyway? Celebrating a touchdown isn't exactly "classy." Trash talk isn't exactly "classy." But both those things are accepted as entertaining parts of the game. It's sports, not a tea party. Athletes can spit on the ground and slap each other's asses but god forbid a woman points at her finger.
Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese are both high earning professional athletes  with endorsements that bring in hundreds of thousands of dollars, with more to follow.  When they start taking endorsement money, they should think more like adults in terms of the impression they leave.  Caitlin Clark:  [https://www.sportingnews.com/us/ncaa-basketball/news/caitlin-clark-nil-deals-iowa-nike/xcueusluamjk66vqfbmsxnr2](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/ncaa-basketball/news/caitlin-clark-nil-deals-iowa-nike/xcueusluamjk66vqfbmsxnr2)  Angel Reese:  [https://ourcommunitynow.com/news/lsu-star-angel-reese-has-the-most-nil-endorsements-of-any-college-basketball-player](https://ourcommunitynow.com/news/lsu-star-angel-reese-has-the-most-nil-endorsements-of-any-college-basketball-player)
lol she def wouldn’t chew him up not bc he’s such a great guy or master arguer but bc Rachel isn’t that revolutionary. She’s way overhyped by BN
Caitlin’s done it to other teams as well as the bench.  I bleed black and gold and have been watching these women all year.  But I don’t have issues with either her or Angel doing it. And Caitlin hasn’t had an issue with Angel doing it either.  Here is a clip of Caitlin talking about trash talk after the SC game.  She respects it  https://twitter.com/tify330/status/1642898398524186625?s=61&t=rUmYTrMSGN8dkzP9Ur_WTQ
There are absolutely clips of Caitlin talking shit, too. You’re just wrong, lmao.
She did exactly what Caitlin Clark did and what every other athlete does. Talking about class during a sports game is stupid as hell to me.   People calling out her behavior don’t seem to pay attention to any other games, because this was very, very normal. Just easier to see in basketball. There is a reason why football players, basketball players, and NHL players alike are all coming to her defense.
🚮
🤢
I think Tayshia reposted that pic to her stories but she put a sticker over the logo on his shirt lol. Everyone was like “beginning of the end” for them.
Umm i highly disagree, they may claim to not be ok with his behavior but they continue to work there. If they really didn’t like it they would leave lol.
Idk I’ve seen more men’s so maybe it just depends what media you consume. Esp considering the men’s hasn’t happened yet (game tonight) most people will stop talking about Caitlin/Reese by tomorrow. I don’t think the point stands at all but like I said maybe depends what type of media you’re consuming
I’m a Hawkeye fan, and I was happy for LSU’s players (especially Jasmine Carson, holy shit what a first half)… they played a great tournament. I was also equally annoyed that Kim Mulkey got another championship. She’s the absolute pits.
Caitlin isn’t and hasn’t made this a thing.  The white men in the media and SM have.  She can give and take it.
I said she is the cockiest player I’VE ever seen. Indicating this is my experience and opinion. Just calling it like I literally saw it.
It’s really not. They wanted to show Iowa they wouldn’t be able to guard them the same. Also, coverage of both teams (SC and LSU) has had an element of racism all year, so it’s really not hard to see why the players would have liked to meet up with SC (among other reasons) and I guess sort of empathize with their loss.  And the general talk of disrespect has mainly been about how the media disregarded them. People have been taking that Alexis Morris clip out of context to make it seem like they’ve been saying they have a personal problem with Clark.
You can disagree, you’re an Iowa fan so I think you’re naturally going to want to defend your player, and that’s ok. I’m not here for an argument. I’m just telling you what I’ve read and at least one LSU player did feel that CC was disrespectful waving off the USC 3 pointer like that. That also came after the Iowa coach made a comment about playing USC is like being in a bar fight, which may have contributed. I don’t know, I’m not LSU, nor am I a fan of LSU. I’m just not a fan of the racism that has been a part of this tournament, as evidenced by members of the media overheard making racist comments, a top team being compared to thugs in a bar fight, and all of the “classless” comments towards the LSU player who did the same thing as CC. It’s frustrating to have that as part of the women’s tournament this year when we really should just be able to celebrate these ladies and their accomplishments. LSU has never won before, CC set some records this tourney, and finally we didn’t have to worry that UConn would win AGAIN. and that really should be what we get to talk about.
Honestly if playing smart according to the scouting report is seen as disrespectful then that’s soft as hell
This is the craziest tangent of this whole thing to me. Iowa had a very specific defensive strategy against SC and executed it flawlessly. It’s not lazy or disrespectful. It was good scouting, good coaching, good execution. SC doesn’t have the long range shooting so Iowa basically sat back and said make us come out and guard you. Iowa/SC was a GREAT game. Loved to see it.
She didn’t lol
Sagging off someone is inherently disrespectful at any level. The defender is quite literally not respecting their shot. But I think what’s getting lost is that these players don’t mean it in the sense that it’s intentionally mean or the wrong thing to do based on the scouting, it’s more like a personal disrespect where players gotta spend the off season making sure no one will ever guard them like that again lol  And Alexis clarified that she was basically saying if they tried to guard her the same way, she would take that personally. LSU probably would’ve guarded SC the same way (as they’ve been guarded all year) had that been the matchup so they’re def not speaking in the sense that it wasn’t smart.
She didn’t, she was telling her teammate that she was covered. People are making a way bigger deal out of it than it was.
Thanks! I agree with your point and wasn’t contesting it at all.  I’ve only seen brief snippets of what Angel has said so I was curious about what Caitlin has said, if anything. I think it’s good and important that she said that. I don’t watch college ball so haven’t followed this saga closely.
They're not different enough to applaud one person for it (saying she has the dog in her) and then call someone else a classless piece of shit. Trying to distinguish it, like Portnoy is, is just arguing for arguing's sake because he didn't like that people noticed his bias.
Not to mention the fact that LSU didn’t shake Iowa’s hands after the game. It was poor sportsmanship all around. The refs ruined that game. (Kim should have been penalized for being on the freaking court for most of the game AND running into a ref)
That’s not true, she did it to a player on Louisville. She taunted players all tourney. As she should, she’s fucking fantastic and it’s a battle on the court.   The BS is anyone giving Angel shit for doing the same thing
They aren’t really when Caitlin has been taunting all tournaments and it’s been touted as part of her greatness. And then when LSU replied with their own shit talking, people are all of a sudden upset that trash talking is “bad sportsmanship”. For crying out loud, it’s a game. It’s a sport. Trash talk is classic behavior and nobody should be called classless for doing it, especially when they can back it up. And Caitlin’s been disrespecting players all tournament by refusing to guard some players thinking their skills weren’t even worth her defense. And I’m not saying that’s a bad thing on Caitlin. You dish it, you better be able to take it when it gets returned. At the end of the day, the racism and misogyny displayed by the media is gross and problematic.   And men’s sports get to not shake hands or whatever all the time. Let them have their moment and celebrate how they want. Honestly, whenever I lost, I disliked having to shake hands with the other team. Have you also watched baseball. The end of a game, the winning team literally shakes their own hands and let the losers sit on their bench. Like come on. Don’t come here being upset about sportsmanship because there are plenty of examples to demonstrate that it’s ridiculous to get up in arms about it.
Did Clark say this? Because it very much looks like she did it to Van Lith as she passed her walking back to the Louisville bench.
Serious question, does Baylor have a policy on sexual orientation? I know they should not if they receive federal funds, but it is a strongly Baptist university. I am a Texas grad and honestly, Baylor was just so opposite. TCU and SMU never gave off the conservative Christian vibe I always felt from Baylor.   I think it would be an incredibly hard university to be gay at. Heck, they tanked the move of 6 teams to the PAC 12 from the Big 12, the California schools strongly opposed Baylor.
Not this particular crew.  The fact that they called 21 fouls in the first half was atrocious. A large part of the game became about the whistle rather than the play.
Yesterday better be their last.
Tom Brady is a douchebag. (I say that as a New Englander who hates the Patriots and Bellechick.)
This right here!!! Also why do we always put higher standards for WOC to be “classy” than others?? Classy is freaking code….
I believe both are millionaires at this point.  Caitlin is talking two more years at Iowa as she will make more playing there than WNBA.  Which is sad, but I am so happy to have her!
HOW DARE YOU DISRESPECT OUR QUEEN  ![gif](giphy|fTdnaYy9MW4KY)
Fellow Hawkeye here. I really hate that people refer to this as Angel v. Caitlin when it really hasn't been Caitlin blowing this up, but rather twitter blowhards.
HEYYY fellow Hawkeye. I think Clark said she didn't even notice lol. Following her around doing it when the game was over was probably overkill but like also who cares
I'm not defending Caitlin. Certain level of trash talking is tolerated. It adds to the excitement and drama. But, what you, I, or anybody else find acceptable may vary. If you're ok with it, fine, others may not be.      People calling out her behavior, especially people on here, probably don't watch sports. And, again, just because people are criticizing her behavior doesn't mean that they are accepting Caitlin's behavior.
The company owns their IP. I wouldn’t leave and give up my career/brand but you do you. I’m good with what I support and what I don’t 🤷🏼‍♀️
If SDSU wins tonight, the women’s final will be a distant memory.
That’s fair.  Rules for theee but not for sheee.   Still works lol.
Sure sure
Iowa wouldn’t guard them the same anyways. LSU doesn’t have a 6’5” 6’7” front court. There is no reason to think they would guard them the same.
Hey, I hear ya. I’m not here for any of the racist BS and am disappointed it’s taken away from such an awesome tournament. I have no real problem with Reese’s trash talking but admit I was salty about it for a minute because I’m biased. Looking forward to next season already!
UConn hasn’t won in a decade. Not even sure they have a women’s program anymore. It’s men’s only basketball championships.
This is the energy im here for lol
Literally. Get better if you want your opponents to respect you more lol
She very clearly waived her off, and it’s okay lol  Nothing is wrong with what either girl has done the whole tournament.
Ya agreed how do you not shake the hand do the team you just beat in the national championship
No handshaking is not a big deal at the end of a ‘ship game. Winning team is immediately celebrating and the losing team just wants to get back to the locker room. I know they lined up and all but I doubt anyone on Iowa really cared.
She did not do the hand in face to a player go look at the actual video instead of believing idiots on Reddit.
I disagree with you on some of this, I played a lot of sports for a long time. Trash talking is part of the game but that doesn’t mean it’s good sportsmanship, it’s just not. And I think there is a difference between trash talking before/during the game versus after. Not shaking their hands was also in bad taste, IMO. I only watched two of iowas games and don’t really follow women’s basketball, so I didn’t really see Caitlin’s trash talking, but if she did it it was also bad sportsmanship.   But I said this in another comment, Angels what, 22 years old? It was probably just in the heat of the moment and I get that. We would not be talking about this if a white man did it. It would just be another day.
Too be fair it wasn’t disrespectful to SC not to guard.  She was right to protect the middle.  SC had an open shot and didn’t take it because she knew she couldn’t make it.  If I was SC coach I would be mad they didn’t try for the open shot.    And Clark had no issues within Angel on the court or in post game interviews.  It’s the media not Clark.
Well you can tell you have never played basketball 😂 that was an actual strategy to not guard someone lol she wanted her to try and shoot it. Don’t be mad at Caitlin bc that girl can’t shoot. It’s literally  a very popular defensive strategy 😂
>And Caitlin’s been disrespecting players all tournament by refusing to guard some players thinking their skills weren’t even worth her defense.   Their skills were demonstrably not worth her defense. They were trash level shooters so Iowa packed the paint, showing that Iowa did in fact respect their game in the paint.
Sadly, you can punish as many gay students as you want as a Christian university and still get those sweet sweet federal bucks.  Religious liberty, baybeeeee  (god I hate this country 🤗).
They don't have a policy that I am aware of. Or at least one that is enforced. I knew/know quite a few openly gay students during my time there. I was there during the Ken Starr/Briles era (toxic) but I think since they made Linda the university president, things have gone in a good direction. They did a research study on the background of all their statues/building names/traditions and released a report to students & alumni with their findings. Along with actionable items they were taking to correct any wrongdoings.   Tbh I'm not sure how I ended up at Baylor. I don't personally jive with majority of conservative ideas and am very much the opposite of it. It felt like the differences didn't come up too much & ppl were just kind to their peers. I remember the day Obama came to Waco and was giving a speech down the road so well. All our teachers canceled class so we could go watch Obamas speech in person 🥹  Edited to add: I loved UT/OU and a lot of the bigger schools. I just personally get hella lost so I wanted to pick a smaller school & everyone seemed so kind. Looking back, yes, I think it would be uncomfortable to be a gay student there. And that is something I hope they are working to make a better environment.
Yes this particular crew is familiar with both teams. Just because they were terrible officials doesn't mean its because of lack of familiarity. Additionally, WCBB had terrible officiating all season so it's not a shock to anyone that actually watches the games all year.
I’ll say it as a New Englander who loves the pats! TB also had terrible sportsmanship and was constantly throwing stuff and yelling at his teammates.
Hes a weirdo who kisses his child on the mouth lol
I loved her as bachelorette her season was great I just think ppl treat her like she’s on par with Michelle Obama or Oprah and she isn’t
Right ! Fellow Hawk here, I’m bummed that in addition to the loss, these random men on Twitter are bringing our team into this issue that Caitlin and the team aren’t even upset about.
She absolutely said she didn’t even notice but I’m not sure I believe that lol I Don’t have any issues with ANYONE doing it. I think part of the reason everyone got their knickers in a knot is because while Reese’s entire team was celebrating, she was following Clark around pointing to her finger.  I honestly found it quite comical
That is where I think it crossed the line too, but if Caitlin doesn’t have a problem with it, I wish everyone could just move on at this point. I really like Caitlin from what I’ve seen, but she’s done her fair share of things on the court too. I can’t even open a single app without seeing something about this which is crazy.
I think if the players don’t have a problem with it, as Caitlin has said numerous times that she doesn’t, then the audience shouldn’t be pearl clutching on her behalf.
Who said they would have to give up their career? Again, seems like ur defending him and its odd
It’ll be a distant memory no matter what. It’s been huge tourney this year bc of all the underdogs, you’re totally right. But ultimately the difference in the media/social platforms of 5mil viewers vs roughly 13mil is vast lol the men’s is still destined to have more attention regardless
Cool ‘tude dude.
Lol…that’s an interesting take. The UConn WOMEN have won eleven championships. Four of those are 2013-now. They’ve made it to the final four nine times since 2013 and they were literally in the championship game last year.
I don’t like what either of them are doing. It’s cringe and embarrassing for them and whoever they are competing against.
That was the icing on the cake for me. The fact that LSU didn’t line up and show decent sportsmanship.
Most teams don’t shake after a championship. I’ve won championships you are too busy celebrating and hugging family to go shake a hand line. Not in HS, AAU, College or Pros  This is another media generated drama
I watch college basketball consistently and I’ve watched Clark all season…   There’s a reason she’s called the best trash talker in basketball
Speaking of videos: https://twitter.com/LeftSentThis/status/1642767205388681216?s=20
I have no gripe with Caitlin. If she dishes it, she has to be ready to take it. And she did take it. The media needs to understand that when a white woman does something, they can’t turn on the black woman for replying in the same manner.
I have played basketball. And when you choose not to guard someone, then it feels disrespectful to that player. And LSU took that and challenged Caitlin’s defense.   I’m fine with what Caitlin has been doing. She said I’m gonna back off and let you take those shots and I wish they capitalized on that.   But let’s not act like Caitlin is this star angel who hasn’t done anything that could be portrayed as taunting.
He was douchebag on and off the field. I was livid when I moved to Florida and he got traded to fucking Tampa. Bellechick allowed him to act like a petulant child only because he was the golden boy for so many years. He’s talented but talent doesn’t excuse poor sportsmanship.
Ok, mushroom. That’s enough out of you!  ![gif](giphy|ebYOIy12eMqDu427kI|downsized)
Right? Like stop showing me stuff let me wallow in the loss in peace.
That's fine, but that behavior may not be up to other peoples standards.    Anyway, the amount of outrage this has caused across social media is fucking ridiculous.
Right back at ya. For one, I’ll acknowledge that I’m biased as a Hawkeye fan, but this narrative that CC is this cocky asshole is so tired to me. I think it’s at best a sour grapes argument from opponents, at at worst a misogynist argument.
[removed]
I disagree but you’re allowed to have your opinion
no one calls her that
Do you know what a clap back is 😂 it means someone was trash talking her and she CLAPPED BACK
I agree with that part of your comments.  I just don’t agree that it’s disrespectful to know your opponent.  If SC wanted to show she was wrong they should have taken the shot.  They were baiting her out of the middle and it didn’t work.
[removed]
Lol no kidding. I thought Reddit would be safe if I avoided the Iowa subreddit 😆
Ughhhh this is how I feel, too. I’m bummed that we lost, the officiating was a mess, and now a bunch of asshole white men are pitting two female athletes against each other. Like just stop. This is the saddest I’ve been about a loss in a long time even WITHOUT this dumpster fire. Also, in addition to the very obvious racial undertones, I doubt we’d even be talking about this if it’d happened in the men’s championship.
Is she a great player and shooter?  Absolutely. Is she also a cocky asshole?   Actions say yes.   But like you said you’re biased and I get that. No point in arguing is further as we won’t agree.
I’m not sure why you’re acting like this. Don’t call me toots. And either know your facts or work on reading comprehension before you come at me with your bullshit. I’m done interacting with you.
Someone posted the ESPN set piece that ran before the final four game just below  Here’s an article after her Louisville game. I can find 5 other places where she herself prides herself on it  https://www.hawkcentral.com/videos/sports/college/iowa/basketball-women/2023/04/01/caitlin-clark-iowa-womens-basketball-trash-talk/11584560002/
You want to believe what you want to believe even with facts so it’s not worth it
They absolutely should’ve taken advantage of it. I think it’s about perspective. If I’m USC and Caitlin isn’t even bothering covering my players, I’d be feeling like damn she’s not respecting me and I would’ve punished her for that.   I’m not saying she’s awful and it’s not a good strategy. I’m saying from the perspective of a player, I’d have felt that was rude and I’d use that to my advantage. And LSU did that. They took all those notes and all the strategies Iowa did and said don’t mess.   It’s similar to if in football they choose to not cover a guy. If I was that guy, I’d feel like hey what about my game is warranting the respect to be covered and I’d try to make them wish they hadn’t.   Does that make sense? I’m using the term disrespect very very loosely here.
Bro no. What even. I said LSU used that disrespect and challenged Caitlin’s defensive skills. LSU really took a lot of stuff that Iowa did during the tournament to heart and used it to fire themselves up and beat them.   But people out here acting like LSU didn’t have the better team and trying to minimize them by putting Caitlin on a pedestal.   Again, I have no problem with how Caitlin defended USC. USC didn’t take advantage of that gap in coverage. But LSU took it and ran with it.   Y’all acting like I’m mad at Caitlin here. And I’m really not. I’m mad that the media is out here acting like LSU just invented trash talk and are using it to minimize their success. Caitlin’s a great player but the way the media have been touting her as the second coming of Jesus is annoying af and she’s been taunting all tournament long. So we shouldn’t act like this is new behavior or shocking behavior and just recognize the sport for what it is. A passionate game with high emotions and really fun interactions.
Hahahah at least the Iowa city one is back to your regularly scheduled storm posts!
I have wanted probably 30 Iowa games this year, I am well aware she is a trash talker. My point is that no one thinks she's the best at it. Most of her moments are lame and cringe.   Angel Reese is much more well known for making clever taunts and dances at people. As is Haley Van Lith. Just because Clark does it a lot doesn't mean anyone considers her the best at it.
I can maybe see it from SC (still a huge stretch), as it’s just knowing your opponent.  But will never see why LSU thought that was disrespectful to them.  Iowa literally said they would defend LSU differently, as you do every team.  But also it happens all the time in men’s bball including the NBA and isn’t considered disrespectful.  To me it’s good game plan, knowing your opponent.  Had  they made the shot Iowa would have changed the strategy.  They seem to be more upset their weakness (one of very few on an elite team) was called out.
If this man is ever the bachelor, he better be ready to meet my husband and kids when its time for hometown dates
The shorter hair and the shorter beard are doing wonders for him honestly
Lord, the way my cavewoman brain just knows he would defend the hell out of our cave
I’m an ally of Blake stans. Thirst on my friends!
He never really did it for me on the show, but he’s gotten way better post bachelorette.
![gif](giphy|elhmwUMsAUbScKLLzl)  Yeah, I can't hear a single word he says when he speaks but my eyes be SEEING

It’s giving AI generated sexy Brawny man/shirtless lumberjack in the best way possible 🥵🔥🔥
I really didn’t get the Blake thirst until he cut his hair
Best he’s ever looked and he knows it too
![gif](giphy|p3wMMqkPBFqsEGI32T|downsized)  BLAKE FOR PARADISE 2023
i want to know why him and katie broke up
https://preview.redd.it/mqy96tguopra1.jpeg?width=851&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9cb40167c732cc4eadbaa3db9d1123a4f93e4f8c
A paradise must
That’s it. This is the post that convinced me Blake is hot as hell.
As a longtime blake betch, here I am 😎
Put this man on paradise
He’s too fine I can’t look at him anymore
I’m a sucker for nice arms…. And he’s got some nice arms
He looks like Thanos and it’s working for me tbh
Did I just become a Blake’s betch? YUP
Honestly I'm not like this huge Blake fan but he would 1000% be a great bachelor. He has unique interests and passions, falls quick and is objectively attractive. Like a way better choice than Zach. Why.
Okay I’m not even into men that look like this irl but 🥵
I needed this today 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥵🥵🥵
That smile though!
Why does he look different? Is he just more muscular now?
i want him and gabi on paradise… idc make it happen!!!!!!!!
Always thought he was cute.
This man has always been fine. I genuinely cannot believe Katie was begging sad boy Greg to stay when Blake was right there.
Did he look like that on the show? 🫢😮‍💨
Still bummed he & Katie didn’t work out!
Blake Moynes Bachelor season WHEN
AHHHH the flair thanks mods 🫶
So he's recovered from his health scare? Is he back in Canada? (He lives in Canada right?)
Maybe he’ll show up on bachelor in paradise Canada
He’s so attractive. His shorter haircut certainly helps. I also think he doesn’t have the best sense of style so sometimes it hides it, but he’s really handsome.
Whoa, he transformed in the last couple years for sure. 🥵
Handsome but not for me
My boy from Hamilton! 😍
![gif](giphy|2junGn23xXTtui41ZR)
This man really went from not doing it at all for me to really doing it for me haha. 🥵
I know this man is cringe and I don’t care. He’s so fine. 🥵
Would like to see him as the Bachelor. I stopped didn't watch Zach's season because I had no interest in him. If they continue only picking contestants from the newest seasons, I'll have no reason to watch.  I'd really love for this show to bring back older, single contestants who truly want marriage -- basically another Arie season.  I don't know their relationship status but I'd love to see Blake, Ben or Zac as the Bachelor.
Hello there! 🥵

I love the gray in his beard; it gives him a more ~distinguished~ look
He’s had quite the glow up since Bachelorette.
It’s me. Hi, I’m the problem it’s me.
Came to the sub just for this
Not a fan of his, but this has me reconsidering that
I really wanted him as Bachelor. I hope he’s on Paradise this summer
WATER....GET YOUR WATER OVER HERE...REFRESHING, ICE COLD WATER OVER HERE... /JK
He kind of looks like Derek Peth.
He has gotten so much hotter since he left the show.
Yoooooooooo he looks pretty good here. Almost like his face/head shrunk.
My mom thinks he looks like Travis Kelce but idk I don’t see it 😂
I think im weird but when I see people tan like this I immediately worry about skin cancer, I hope it’s a spray on
Damn katie. Why did you leave this man 🫠
Yeah, he’s hot…better hair now too. Not so…..”messy” 😉
As long as he doesn’t talk
🥵🥵🥵  I would let him do whatever he wants to me.
I’d love to see him on paradise but this man is negative hot to me.
Why is he reminding me of Jax Taylor?
Doing nothing for me 🤷‍♀️
He’s hot, but I’ll be honest — his voice and inability to articulate himself without saying “like” every two seconds is what makes him unattractive to me. Not that anyone cares
Juice.   Don’t argue with me on this one.
No thanks
This sub has unrealistic body expectations for men
He really is my dream man 😩
I just do not find him attractive at all….
I don’t like that he works with the conservationists who chase Africans from ancestral lands but daaamnnnn
Blake has always been the same: hot until he talks
Him and Katie was the worst.... all the emotions for each other felt fake as hell.  Would never bother watching a season with him as Bachelor, would be a horrible horrible pick.
The way some people call Tyler Cameron ugly and thirst over Blake. It’s a no from me   edit: I’ll take all your downvotes cause I’ll die on this hill.
Why does this sub keep trying to make Blake happen? I don't understand it lol
He's definitely hot but being 32 and still living with your mom gives me the ick
[removed]
Omgggg I love this because it is so true for me too 😂😂😂
This deserves comment of the year!!!
I will storm the mansion.
This is exactly the appeal 💀💀
the scream I scrumpt 😭😭😭😭😭
💀💀💀 omg this is it
PLEASE ???😭
i’ve been laughing at this comment for hours
All time sub comment right here folks lol
For April fools day r/romancebooks did "books with this vibe," but I'm about to unironically post this comment with a vibes like this request. 🤣
You got a nice bush for the caveman to hide in?
😆  I can’t say that I disagree.
🫡
😂😂😂
HAHAHAH this is hilarious. I think all instagram pics are dumb but this one actually made me laugh.
You can find cosmo and wanda everywhere
This is also the best definition of my type that I’ve ever heard 😂
The beard got better too!
OMG 💀
Omg 😱 😭😂
Hahahahaha 😳
![gif](giphy|Y3jbbAszRGZTpQiTmr|downsized)  Me entering the beach like
Babe 💀
She pretty much said it in interviews and Blake has kind of hinted at it as well. He’s never really had a serious relationship before so he didn’t know how to prioritize it or be a partner. He was too independent. I do think there’s actual evidence to support this, but I’m sure Katie isn’t without her faults too.   I also just think it was likely very difficult for them to overcome the Greg stuff.
I listened to a recent podcast she did, and one of the things she said was that when he was about to go on his animal rescue trip he told her he probably wouldn't have service for calls or texts but that she could watch his Instagram stories 😂 like a fan lmao  I think she also said that they just didn't work in real life, like their lives and friends groups didn't mesh
I think Katie and Blake are both nice people, but that season was doomed when two of the Final 4 self eliminated.  and Katie’s appearance on Game of Roses gives the impression she’s still in love with Greg. She’s saying he was a producer plant for Bachelor now because she’s mad at herself for falling so hard for him, not because she sincerely believes that.
screaming
Your flair 🤌🏻😘
We are still here thriving
He falls in love so quick I feel like paradise would break his brain 😆
This SENT me
![gif](giphy|Q8auEgoR7x0CcgH4uQ)
I wouldnt be able to take it just because he adds the word "like" after every other word.
He also got rid of the pointy beard
Yes.
No
Yea I do not understand how that relationship failed
What was the health scare?
Id swoon
Same, like my brain recognizes that he’s an objectively good looking man but somehow does nothing for me.
Nothing about him interests me. I’m sure the feeling would be mutual lol, but I just don’t find him attractive
905, what up!
Ben 😍 yes please!
😂
That would be the messiest season ever. He'd say he was in love night one. I'm here for it.
If anyone on this show is making a fantasy suite baby it’s him
I’ll take one of each
I thought this too in this picture.
Plz don’t insult Derek’s intelligence…erm, looks, like that.
As someone who had melanoma cancer, I get it.
I doubt it, he's outside a lot.
ya i'm with you on that. I always think of south park when he talks lol
Same and it’s not his fault he just reminds me of creepy closeted Scientologist John travolta
Omgggg why did you have to ruin it for all of us? 😂
![gif](giphy|baPIkfAo0Iv5K|downsized)
I thought it was doing something for me finally, but I just don’t have my glasses on yet
Lmao. I had the same thought
?
So he's friendly and respectful to those who work in the food industry, I don't understand why that's an issue.
relax.
You seem fun
I feel you. Just different preferences. I personally think Blake has had a major glow up since Katie’s season.
TC is 🔥
Just like how others gush over Tyler C. To each their own 🤷🏼‍♀️
I don't get it either lol. They want him to be the next Tyler C so bad...
I think more and more people are staying home until they are ready to either move for work or get married. I don’t hate this tbh… it’s financially responsible and hopefully it means the kids the helping out. A lot of people don’t have the kind of money they thought they would at this age and some retirees are having to go back to work. It’s sad.
He has his own house, lol. He bought his own home but rents it out. He stays with his mom for the animals cause he's never there most of the time to take care of them. He's buying another one to rent out also.   My brother makes the most money out of our family but lives with our mom cause he travels for work a lot. It doesn't make sense for him to have a home when he doesn't have a wife yet.
in this economy?????
Judging people for their financial situation is 🤮
Kate is this you?
Well jokes on you them, he's going to be loaded whenever he does end up marrying someone, between the income on his rental properties and saving up living with his mom. Not to mention awesome family values! It's a very American thing to feel the ick for living with parents into adulthood. It's common in a lot of cultures to live with family until marriage.
This is such a lame thing to harp on
Don’t know why you’re being downvoted. People on this sub made fun of Pilot Pete for living with / close to his parents, but excuse it when it’s someone they like.
??? Those are pec muscles lol he’s in great shape
I remember either one or both saying Blake was super independent, and it didn’t help he was in Africa for work, and that hyper independence makes a relationship hard. Take it from me, also a hyper independent Leo who has never had a serious relationship 😅
I know he’s a real life human person, but this is why I’d love to watch.
They (or at least Katie) claimed long distance was the issue but honestly I don’t think she was ever invested and was looking for a reason to bounce. She moved to San Diego right after the show and in her interviews about them she would say things like “we’re focusing on ourselves and if it works out, it works out.” I think she was likely the one to pull the ripcord.  I know there are a lot of factors in making a relationship work but Blake is sexy and seems like he’d be a really dedicated partner, plus he’s the only one who specifically went on the show for her. I think if not for the Greg drama she would have been more open to making things work for longer. That’s all speculation, of course.
His mom posted he was quite sick when he was away working with animals. (I can't remember what country).
Most of the men in the franchise have that effect on me but Blake is 100% my type!
This made me realize that I don’t know which Ben you’re necessarily talking about, but all of them in BN are so cute and unproblematic. Let’s cast more Bens!!!
I can see it now “so Jessie… what if we did fantasy suites BEFORE hometowns 😉
He looks like a cartoon lol. And I don’t like his personality either - when he was on Katie’s season talking about how ~sex positive~ she was I got an immediate ick that cannot be overcome. I think he’d be fun to watch on paradise tho lol
I don’t see it at all. Jax looks washed up. Blake looks like a zaddy
Vanderpump has been constantly on my mind since Scamdoval broke
![gif](giphy|QZOaeparxsNOfKWbER)
Look it up. He’s juiced.
You can be friendly and respectful without having a 15 minute convo in the drive thru line. I'm kind of with the OP, it's good that he is kind, but it's a little disrespectful to the other people in line. Especially at a coffee place, where a lot of people are in a rush trying to get to work. And the angry people end up taking out their frustration with the wait on the employees anyway.
I'm well aware haha it doesn't change the fact that it gives me the ick though.
>He's buying another one to rent out also.   Just what this province needs - landlords who own a few properties and don't live in any of them.
Yep.
Sure, although he can afford to live on his own or with roommates (he's buying a second house just to rent it out). I'm sure he's not upset that some stranger on the internet has the ick because he still lives with his mom lol
💀 you caught me 😂
We're both Canadian... And I don't need a "loaded" partner because I've been self-sufficient for years. Not like we would date anyway, lol
Agree to disagree.
Haha I expected it but my point still stands. It's a thirst post of a sub fave so bound to be a UO

I always felt like he moved his mouth awkwardly when he spoke. I couldn’t get over it lol
YES. I get such an ick with Blake.
You and my both!!! Haha I appreciate the crossover lol
Does that mean steroids?
damn ok moneybags
Tell me you've never seen a male body without telling me you've never seen a male body. Just like women's breasts come in all shapes and sizes, men's pecs also come in a variety of shapes and sizes
He's about to own a second house just for the purpose of renting it out. He's doing fine.
This is BS.  Her kid can’t possibly be 14. I’m still the same age that I was when Trista’s season aired.
![gif](giphy|TfseOfhwd6BJC)
Ten years until she’s our first ✨Legacy Bachelorette✨
HOLY CANNOLI. 😲🤯 Hard to believe that Trista and Ryan's kids are teenagers now. Time really does fly, huh? I remember watching Trista's season (and the wedding) with my mom when I was a Sophomore in HS. Isn't this year their 20th anniversary? I feel seriously OLD now. 🤣  ETA: She's always been one of my fave Bachelorettes; definitely GOAT. Trista and Ryan make an epic couple.
unrelated but Trista looks insanely gorgeous as both a blonde *and* a brunette which is so rare
I just adore trista. She replied to my dm on IG once lol. Her daughter is beautiful just like her!
Trista is beautiful and looks just radiant. I see so much of Ryan in their daughter.
No way she's 14 already 😭😭 happy birthday to the Blueprint Bachelorette's baby!
Omg! She looks soooo much like her dad! Beautiful girl. 💗
Wow she has her dad’s eyes. ❤️
![gif](giphy|xzKjC4FVISI9dGIaQJ)
14 🤯🤯🤯 I am mind blown rn.
This is so cute. She seems like a wonderful, supportive mom
I know I am already an ancient 40 years old but somehow this makes me feel even older.  Random but the name Blakely has become a super popular name in my area and every time I see it I think about Trisha's daughter Blakesly.
Awe. This is so sweet. I feel old 😪
Aww, they are both sooo beautiful!
Trista looks the same
They are both beautiful (Blakesley looks so much like her dad) and I'm staring at Trista's teeth. They're so perfect.
Has she attended any filmings lately? It used to feel that she was very active in the show directly, whether good morning america or after final rose type shows. Not that she has to be
14? With a face full of makeup and red lip?
Me too, let’s go get some Candies jeans together! 🤣
Oh, I'm like the Crypt Keeper!!! Great Freaky Friday reference BTW. 😁😂
Same same same
Ahaha I just had the same thought  I both hope this does and does not happen
I've oddly haven't met any Blakeslys, but I know three Henleys, which makes me think of Doug and Jamie Hehner's daughter, haha. I know they call her by her middle name but Henley Hehner is a horrible name.
We have a blakeleigh at my kids school 😳
Exactly what I was going to say, this is so sweet, except when my daughter turns 14 I’ll actually be old😭
They never asked her
🙄   Looks to be a dance recital with the makeup paired with the hair slicked back in a bun.
I don’t even know if she does dance, but it pretty clearly looks like dance team makeup. And if it’s not, who cares lmao? A lot of 14 year olds wear makeup
Ok I didn’t want to be judgey, but I had the same thought! Glad others are pointing out it’s for dance. I’m certainly just projecting, but I wore a lot of makeup at that age, wouldn’t be caught without eyeliner all through HS, and regret that I couldn’t just love my baby face for what it was.
I'm in the south so I think adding a Ly or lyn to any name or root word to make it a name it just very common. Sometimes it works... Sometimes not so much lol But as a photographer I have 3 Blakely clients with various spellings.
That's so interesting! I'm on the East coast so this is new to me. Now I want to hear more "Ly" names!
I assume he took his niece, he's talked on his blog before about getting her tickets to Taylor Swift concerts. The NYT profiled Steve a while ago and he lives pretty modestly, I think it's wholesome that he spends his money on this kinda stuff.
This sparked joy for me and I am unashamed
I love this for Rita Skeeter.
This man is an enigma
Love this 😂 I love seeing fanboy Steve. He’s also thinking of going back in the summer because of how much fun he had 🥺 I live for ppl having a blast
ngl this is some wholesome Steve content. i'm here for it! love that he's sharing this side of himself with us.
This is actually hilarious and I love it
What an enigma.
I love seeing people really loving a concert!
Swiftie Steve is my favorite Steve!
i love this crossover content lol get it steve ✨✨✨
Jumpscare
Reality Steve got tickets and *I DIDN’T* !!??? What is this world
I would have been sooo disappointed if I missed Death by A Thousand Cuts and Clean by one night!
Swiftie Steve living his best life out here
Best thing about him.
Him turning the camera onto himself for the OOOOHs has me literally DEAD
i’m not really a fan of tswift, but i’m having fomo seeing everyone at her concerts and having so much fun looool
Shoot I’d be right there with him. Sing it Steve! 🎤
Haha good for him. This is so fun
I can't fully hate RS and it's because of our shared love of Taylor Swift
Nice seats!  Sing it!
Wow, this actually makes Steve almost somewhat likable/relatable. 😁😂 Why can't he be cool like this more often (instead of salty and petty)?
as he should! 💅🏼 and im v jealous
Straight man who loves reality TV and Taylor swift? We have no choice but to stan
Bro said, team no sleep 😤🙅🏻‍♀️
LOL OMG Reality Steve. I listen to his daily's most mornings and enjoy them. He's such a Taylor Swift fan and has been talking about her and her shows for months.
\*him  ![gif](giphy|AgPt9udT567spxbSHf)
The range of types of people who are huge fans of Taylor swift is absolutely mind blowing. From 13 year old girls to older white men like reality Steve & Dave portnoy, is there another artist that has this diverse of a fan base?
Besides the point but if I heard the lucky one live I would never recover
Respectfully why does everyone in this video look awkward
Bless him, this is so wholesome, I love it!
I kind of have a soft spot for him idc
Could RS be any more of a basic bitch if he tried
i just can’t get over how he creeped on demi b 🤨🤨
Why does he look like he has 2 black eyes?
Is he there solo?
I hope he's with his kids or something lol
He’s a huge fan - this is his fifth TS concert. No idea if he went alone or not, but he would definitely go alone.
Yet the whole video is just him 🤔😂
Yet the whole video is just him 🤔😂
it’s so wholesome
Rhubarb Salad
Hahaha just wrote this. I’ve been following him for so long.
I loved it and watching the random bf/guy behind him looking absolutely miserable in every single story had me absolutely losing it laughing.
especially after the pandemic, seeing this like this really warms my heart
Those are my all time 2 favorite songs and I could have sobbed when I found out she played them
This is really the concert for the fair weathered fans! It’s all her well known hits so you’re more likely to know the set list than maybe an album specific tour. 10/10 recommend.
Same haha. I like two songs but was never a swiftie
even real superfans had to give our blood sweat and tears to get tickets lol
I’m the opposite; I like the majority of her music but I’m not big on concerts unless they’re pretty small and lowkey because I get overstimulated and crowded places stress me out. I’m glad to see people are having so much fun though; it makes me wish I liked this stuff more.
same because her costumes and all of the special effects and staging look incredible. wish i enjoyed her music lol
Girl- truly you just made my day!😂🥰
i don’t keep up with him and i didn’t know anything about him, so to see him described this way makes so much sense and cracked me up
Seriously tho.   I got tickets in Philly on the second chance thing since I signed up for the presale. I saw prices on resell sites and saiid fuckkkkk I could really use some extra money. So I figured let me list it for the cheapest price on the site, if they sell then I can use that money for something more important, if not then im souped I get to see her!!!!   They sold in 24 hours. Im like what the fuck. Who can actually pay that much for nose bleeds??   Then I found out I don’t get the money til the shows over. Which sucks but at least I’ll get some money back. I felt really guilty bc I love Taylor and I also didn’t want to be a “reseller”. I had no intentions to do that but I mean im broke and could use it better than the actual resellers listing each ticket for what I sold 2 for.
Many. Beyoncé to name one.
I know. Anytime I see him I just think he’s a creep and wish SOMEONE ANYONE else could’ve spoiled the show and done the job. Makes me sick he’s such a creep and made his living off the backs of this show with a mainly female audience.
i have eyes like his. he has no fat under his eyes, making them look really sunken in. the fact that he has plump cheeks makes the sunken part stand out more as well.
Those of us in the Dark Circle Community appreciate the representation 🤣
Body shaming extends to men, as well.
Who cares
I’m sure he went by himself since he’s seen her a few times in the past. A lot of us go to concerts by ourselves 😂
Why?  Taylor is for everyone!
He used to take his niece and nephew
why? men can enjoy concerts too!
Omg lol. Not everyone could go to a concert alone. I have a friend who went to a Harry Styles concert by himself once and I can't imagine.
I think she's a teenager, it's probably better that he doesn't post her. Just look at the mean things being said here about his appearance.
So adorable 😂❤️
Omg I looked at his highlights after seeing this comment and it's hilarious. That is way too long of a show to go to if you're not a fan!
I was gutted when I saw that combo
I maybe know one song but I’m obsessed with everything about this tour. Hahaha
🥰🥰
While tearing the women apArt on every aspect. Especially physically? Come onnnn
I know my dark circles are because of my autoimmune disease, but I didn’t think about how his are so pronounced because his under eyes are sunken in. Interesting
His are the darkest I’ve ever seen. Does this man sleep? 😂
I wasn’t aware he had dark circles…I’ve genuinely never seen him before. Not sure how my comment would be perceived as body shaming when I’m not making fun of him, but asking a genuine question…
He just looks awkward by himself surrounded by teenage girls.
I didn’t go to 1989 because I had just moved overseas and had no one to go with - I regret it to this day and promised myself I’d never miss out again just because I was worried about being alone. Obviously some people’s anxiety just straight up doesn’t let them though!
Yeah he definitely didn't take this video at a flattering angle😂 As someone part of the dark circle gang he should have known better LOL. But at least it's something some good filler can fix for those who really don't like them!💉
Sometimes your skin just wants to scream “I’m a capo in the mob!” even if your brain just wants to belt TS 🤷🏻‍♀️
Taylor is 33 and has plenty of older fans
My brain belts TS on a 24/7 basis. I wake up at 1 am and there will be a song in my head 😂
I don’t mind taking on extra work. What gets to me is being asked to do something by a colleague, and then it gets completely critiqued. If you have all these strong opinions, just do it yourself in the first place?
NASA and the Canadian Space Agency just announced the 4 astronauts who are going on Artemis II to the moon. Surreal to think we're going back to the moon again.
So I was invited to be on the interview committee for a social studies teacher today. The current department chair is "checked out" and didn't show up, so I ended up being the de facto "deparmtnet representative". The candidate wasn't a good fit, we all agreed upon that, but they're interviewing some other internal candidates that I don't think will be a good fit mainly because they won't have any experience and I'll end up doing all the lesson planning and legwork for the team...and I don't want that. So I feel like I'm having to put myself out there to be on each of these upcoming interviews so I end up with a teaching partner that won't expect me to do all the work...it's a lot to worry about.  Also, I got the sense in today's interview, and have been getting the sense based on comments made and offers for conferences extended to me, that they're planning to offer me department chair when this one leaves. It's very flattering, but my worry is that our 8th grade team has a lot of people staying that wouldn't be very good grade level team leads (I wanted that position because of that reason) and if I take one, I don't think I can take the other. Do I want to be department chair and have that title but potentially work under a team lead I don't like or work well with, or do I still shoot for team lead (even knowing the coworkers I'm worried about will fight me on pretty much every decision I make as team lead anyway).   Or do I just deal with whatever team lead we get, and take department chair and just focus on trying to build up the department (because I'm one of only two people staying, so the department is going to be in "rebuild" mode)?  Much to think about.
I sat down to watch tonight and then I rememberedt
Skiing in Saas-Fee might have been the most challenging thing I've ever done in my life. Today we went Alpine Canyoning which was so fun but also physically difficult for someone who isn't as active as they used to be. I am very proud of myself for doing all these things I never thought I would do in my life. Next stop: paragliding 😅
I interviewed for an internal position last week, I’m interested in the job but I have NO experience in a lot of it. I assumed I wouldn’t get it and put my guard up about it.   Fast forward to today, I got pulled into an impromptu meeting with the people I interviewed with and literally started to shake to the point I started to cry 😵‍💫 I expected to get a no and was embarrassed. After about 15 minutes of us talking and me in and out of nervous tears they offered me the position.   I’m very torn. I love my current boss and the work I do, but this would give me more of an opportunity long term to grow. I keep going back to “what if position xxx opened tomorrow, how would I feel” there’s one other position I’m interested in which is more inline with what I’m doing.   So the question I’m trying to answer is: is comfort and trust with my boss (literally the main reason I don’t want to leave) worth learning something completely new. I’m great at my job, what if I fail doing this.   Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
Does anyone have any tips for sticking to a budget. I overspent last month and I have to stick to $110 per week for food and any other unnecessary purchases this month. This doesn’t include gas or bills or anything that money is set aside already. I’m dog walking in my spare time so I think I’ll actually have more than $110 per week but I just know myself and overspend so easily
anyone have any good recommendations for a solo weekend trip? it would be my first one so looking to stay in the us. i'm in new england, but was thinking maybe asheville? austin? i'm open to recommendations!
The political discourse surround my city’s mayoral campaign is so disheartening. I’m not a fan of either candidates but I feel like so much coded language is being used against the black candidate. I’m so disgusted that these are my neighbors
What’s everyone watching tonight? I had a rough day and was hoping to just loaf on the couch and watch Jesse Palmer, but the season is over!  I have the first episodes of Farmer Wants a Wife saved, might try those. Would love to hear your off-season recs!
One of my favorite things I learned this weekend:  [Bryce Harper reads romance novels.](https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/128n9bk/lugardo_bryce_harper_is_a_big_romance_novel_guy/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1)  He reads Elle Kennedy. I’ve never read any of books — have y’all? She seems to be a sports romance writer? I can see how that would appeal to Bryce.  The top comment in that r/baseball post says romance novels are LDS-accepted forms of entertainment (as compared to pornography).  You learn something new everyday on this here Reddit!  ETA: Elle Kennedy posted this earlier! This must be fun for her. Lol.  https://preview.redd.it/chbt6a5zkrra1.jpeg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=aa0140c1ec1fe87f72de3060a9c58dd35e358492
Which of these currently single or unresolved Love Is Blind contestants would have the best Bachelor season?   Sal, Jarrette, Kyle, Marshall, Paul, Kwame, or suggest  another…  I didn’t include Brett because I will sob if he and Tiffany break up.
Super excited!!
What do you want to do? What does your gut say?  Personally, I feel like a lot of jobs involve learning while on the job, and having a safety net in doing so.  Do you trust that your new manager would provide the support you need? I feel like having a good manager does make a huge difference in your work experience.  Lastly, if they didn’t think you could do the job, they wouldn’t offer it to you. Trust yourself and that you bring something to the table! 🙂
I use an app called You Need a Budget (paid) but there are freemium alternatives out there. Mint comes to mind. Or you could search Etsy for an Excel template you like. YNAB also has lots of free resources on the blog and YouTube channel.  It took me a while to get the hang of it, but it did help me build a budget and learn the skills to stick to it.
Try and be creative and think of alternatives of your normal big spenders! For me, instead of inviting friends for drinks, I invite them to my place for drinks and a movie night (or crafts, etc.). For museums, I check out the library to see if they have free passes. If I like coffee every day, I try and make a treat at home instead! Or instead of working at a coffee shop, I’ll work at the library and pack a lunch. Stuff like that.   Also I learned that normally people get 80% of the joy of shopping from carrying the item around the store (or in your cart) and then putting it back. That helps me sometimes!
Something I did when creating a budget was having an excel sheet that had all my budget limits. I made the totals at the top and whenever I spent money I subtracted that amount from the total. I think visually seeing that number drop helped me hold back, and I was able to stop myself from going over it when it got to close to 0.
My fav solo was Nashville. City is pretty walkable and I never felt unsafe walking. Ubers were cheap when I was in a food coma lol mostly eating, drinking and music. DC might be fun to do solo as well. I’ve done it with a group but I imagine by yourself, you could really take your time and explore the museums you’re interested in the most.
I live in NC and Asheville is great! Lots of hiking and there's a  River Arts District with awesome art studios. There's good food and beer, but it's also just pretty scenery if you don't want to hang out downtown
What do you want to do?
Boulder! So cute, great nature.
Sedona, it’s magical
I love to solo travel. I am now based in Colorado but Denver is great for a solo trip. I also have done Sedona, Santa Fe, Albuquerque and Cheyenne. Omaha is also an underrated city, great food options and one of my favorite zoos.
NYC!
I loved Arizona. Stayed in a resort in Cave Creek. Very relaxing. Great deal on the resort too using Hotwire hot rate
Succession and baseball
Yellowjackets and Succession.
I’ve read every single one of her off campus books at least twice. Also some of her other books from Briar U and others. They’re comfort reads for me! Pretty good, but not amazing or mind blowing tbh!
It is now my headcanon that Bryce Harper is part of a real life [Bromance Book Club](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/44019067)
I think Marshall. Seems very serious but also emotional enough he would probably cry and give us some good tv
I love Marshall and he had the connection of being a cousin of Justin’s from Katie’s season.
I'm going with Kwame. He is very charismatic and entertaining to watch and I think he would have a super messy season. I can see him choosing someone and then being with someone else by ATFR.  I absolutely cannot watch Sal sing to people for an entire season. STOP SINGING ON REALITY TELEVISION.
Lauren's parents on the senior version pls!
That’s good advice I think I have been waiting until the end of the month to tally my spending because it would make me to anxious to see I had no money left but I think if I can just do it daily it will go by much better
On that note, Alexandria isn’t too far from DC and is a beautiful place to walk around.
one of my best friends lives in dc so i've been a number of times, but nashville might be a good option!! i went twice when i was a lot younger and remember liking it a lot. thanks for your input!!
i'd love to go somewhere where i can go on a good hike or two, eat some good food, and maybe see some live music!
Santa Fe is soooo nice! It’s just so relaxing and almost feels European with the architecture continuity. Denver is fun but I think it’s better with a buddy (I live there now).
i live in connecticut, so i go there somewhat often! great option for others, though!
Great episode!
I think Kwame's going to love all the female attention coming his way.  May not need the lotion and rag so much...
I had the same issue too, where I didn't want to look at my credit card until the end of the month, because I feared I overspent. Doing it daily made it much easier to digest. Way easier to accept I spent 50 bucks at target, then seeing my credit card bill in the thousands
Seattle! Gorrrrgeous hiking, tons of live music venues, and excellent seafood. Portland is a short drive as well if you want two awesome cities in one trip.  Missoula Montana is also a favorite place of mine if you want a smaller city vibe. Montana is breathtaking and Missoula is actually really hip. They had sweet potato fries before I saw them anywhere else in the country. Sweet little farmer's markets and flea markets when the weather's nice as well.
😂
RS update:  - Doesn’t know who got the one on one but got a description of what he looked like so he has an idea   - Got a pic of where he can see about six guys leaving the lobby to head to the group date yesterday but doesn’t have them all identified yet but has a good idea of who they were. Doesn’t believe there was only six but that’s just who was in the pic.   - One on One today and Rose Ceremony tomorrow!
Shoutout to our queen bachelorwhatever for getting confirmation that Aaron B got the first group date rose!  https://preview.redd.it/wnufgxjn4ura1.jpeg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=895db61d00194851222c46c84f0e9b6fe1292ebb
Who do we think Charity’s front runners are so far?
Jesse said something unique happens on y the finale   Seemed like a boring finale to me  What was he teasing?
When do the seasons usually start traveling internationally? I’m asking because if they’re filming in the US right now during week 4, is that not normal?
Since they’re not doing international travel for Charity’s season, is it safe to assume BIP will go back to the normal 11-13 episode count again, as another cost saving measure?
Can he at least described how his general physical features looked like instead of teasing that he knows how he looks like? Black, white, Asian, etc? Blonde hair or Dark Hair? At least we can pinpoint based on who’s still there.
Hopefully he leaks the pic
Hmmm with 6 coming out of the lobby I wonder if that was a Bachelor Bowl date and the teams were separated? What time of day were they spotted? If it’s night I wonder if it’s the winning team getting to go to the after party?
![gif](giphy|xT0Cyhi8GCSU91PvtC|downsized)
I personally don't think I've seen enough of Charity with her men to be able to tell who the frontrunners are. At this poing I only feel safe saying I'm fairly certain that Brayden won't be F1, & neither will Joey. Other than that I don't really know. I hope we can get more pics & vids.
I think Michael, John B and a guy we haven't seen yet.
Joey, John B, Michael based on sources who’ve seen them in person at group dates and what we see in videos. Though, people have been noticing that Joey didn’t look like a frontrunner in one video but then a couple people said they could see her romantic connection with Joey on that same group date not caught on camera. A couple people mentioned that John B and Charity have crazy chemistry on stage, and that video kinda gave a glimpse of that. And Charity looked most at ease with Michael on both group dates he’s been in.   I’m actually not sure about Brayden (Edit: who is only one we know for a solo 1-on-1 not coming from a group date) because when I saw the videos of them in baseball field, they didn’t really have great chemistry 😬 maybe the producers will edit it better. Idk which Aaron won the first group date. And really don’t see the chemistry between her and Sean based on the interaction I’ve seen so far, girl looked disappointed he won that group date lol.
Maybe the F2 arriving to the final rose ceremony knowing she wasn't the one & being super open/making comments about it? Gabi didn't even let Zach deliver his prepared break up speech lol. Idk that's all I can think of, but they always say stuff like that no matter what happens...
IDK, an Bachelor engagement happens? The man has only been host for less than two years. Maybe this is shocking to him lol.  Cause outside of Gabi knowing that it wasn't her at the final rose ceremony, knowing about that finale was unique.
they showed part of charity’s night 1 maybe he was referring to that?
I’m guessing Gabi’s attitude at the Final Rose ceremony, knowing it wasn’t her and not letting Zach do his pre-planned breakup speech.
Domestic travel for week 4 is pretty common. Although I wouldn’t be shocked if the next location is also domestic. If I was an international city, I would not be inviting the franchise to my city right now on taxpayers‘ dime (or however they fund their tourism boards). I don’t think the tourism return is worth it.  While no international travel definitely sucks for the contestants, I don’t think it matters much for this show anymore. They don’t really make use of the locations anymore. A fake therapy date in the US hits just the same as a fake therapy date in Europe, etc etc etc.
It in common for them to film week 4 in the US. They typically start international travel episode 5
Wait, is that confirmed?
I hope they can at least go to Greece even if it’s after hometowns, as Charity has expressed that’s her dream location. As for staying domestic, it would be great if they can try Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and U.S. Virgin Islands.
Though most seasons would have at least 1-3 states with 2-3 international locations.  Seasons have traveled in the last 20+ seasons:  * Zach: Bahamas, London, Estonia, Budapest * G&R: Le Havre, Bruges, IJMuiden/Amsterdam (all taken via cruise ship) * Clayton: Houston, Toronto, Croatia, Vienna * Four seasons (Michelle, Katie, Matt James and Clayshia) were all impacted by COVID but Michelle traveled to her hometown of Minneapolis, as The Bachelor Mansion was restricted from using for filming purposes due to the pandemic * Peter: Cleveland, Costa Rica, Chile, Peru * Hannah: Rhode Island, Scotland, Latvia, Netherlands * Colton: Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Denver * Becca: Utah, Las Vegas, Richmond, Bahamas * Arie: Lake Tahoe, Florida, Paris, Tuscany * Rachel: South Carolina, Norway, Denmark, Geneva * Nick: Wisconsin, New Orleans, Saint Thomas, Bimini * JoJo: Pennsylvania, Uruguay, Buenos Aires, Pampas * Ben Higgins: Las Vegas, Mexico City, Exuma, Indiana * Kaitlyn: New York City, San Antonio, Dublin * Chris: New Mexico, Badlands, Iowa * Andi: Connecticut, South of France, Venice, Belgium * Juan Pablo: Seoul, Vietnam, New Zealand, Miami * Desiree: Atlantic City, Munich, Barcelona, Madeira * Sean: Montana, Lake Louise, St. Croix * Emily: Bermuda, London, Croatia, Prague (the season was filmed in North Carolina instead of usual The Bachelor Mansion in California due to Emily taking care of her daughter, who was a child at the time) * Ben Flajnik: Sonoma, San Francisco, Utah, Puerto Rico, Panama City, Belize * Ashley: Las Vegas (dates only), Thailand (x2), Hong Kong, Taiwan * Brad 2.0: Las Vegas, Costa Rica, Anguilla * Ali: New York City, Iceland, Istanbul, Lisbon * Jake's season visited entirely in California with a cross state road trip in week 4, then to San Francisco in week 5 * Jillian: Vancouver, Okanagan Valley, Banff (only the last two locations taken on a train)  Earlier seasons such as Travis Stork and Lorenzo Borghese, those had started outside of the US. Travis's season filmed mostly in France and Lorenzo's season also filmed in Italy because of his Italian heritage.
Agreed. I'm sure we could figure out who they are😂
Probably won’t unless he figures out who is who. I wish people would send pics to bachelor whatever too.
Could also just be for transportation if they have to split all the guys plus producers across multiple vans
What’s F1?
Those are my 3 as well. I’ve seen some good comments about Tanner too but we haven’t seen many photos or videos of him yet.   I saw more chemistry between Charity and John B in that clip of them just standing together, compared to the clip of her and Brayden hugging in the middle of the stadium 😭 I have a hard time predicting Brayden because imo he’s either getting eliminated next week or he somehow pulls a Dean on Rachel’s season and makes it to top 4. Could go either way.
What's the video? I've seen it referenced a few times but I don't recall if I've seen it 🤔
Michael and Joey looked like top 4 when the pics dropped. Lol John replaced Warwick.
So essentially people may be worried for nothing?
Even in L.A, if they made use of the location, there’s better dates they could be doing than say … Gabby and Nate in a randomly placed hot tub in the middle of nowhere.
It's not confirmed but Disney/ABC is  doing budget cuts. I'm sure they will travel this season. It would weird if they don't.
It’s not confirmed
Reminds me of when RS had pics of Michelle and Brandon during filming of the LCDs and couldn't figure out who he was, and he wouldn't share the pics. Like we probably would've identified him in SECONDS.
Right like please send me pics. I’m not going to hold on to them, I’ll share them here with y’all so we can find out the contestants 😂
Final 1/winner.
That hug in middle of stadium looked inorganic 🫣 like they were trying to be nice to each other instead of actually wanting to hug each other. I have heard of a Tanner being a frontrunner but I haven’t really seen much of him in the videos or in group date photos.
Sixth slide on this post https://www.instagram.com/p/CqZeBrBM4H1/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y= She's standing directly in front of John B., with Joey to John's left.
I had John B and Warwick in my top 5 along with Joey, Michael, and John Henry, before any of the dates started getting spoiled on video. There’s no replacement between John and Warwick on my end. My two East Asian men are equal in my heart 🫶
I think people are more concerned based on spoiler sites saying they heard it would be all domestic as opposed to where they actually are now
I LIVE IN VANCOUVER WA! I wonder where they’re at!
I’m guessing they’ll do domestic travel until hometowns and then go somewhere international for fantasy suites and final rose ceremonies.
Oh ok. It makes no sense for them to not travel for charity. Part of the experience is the travel and deserves it as much as the other bachelor and bachelorettes
Didn’t he say it was Pizza Peter or something absurd like that?
Yeah. Your original comment also just made me realize that Brayden got the first 1-on-1?? I totally missed that, I thought it was the second. Just based off that I think Charity just found him cute and gave him a date right away lol. The nerves of it being the first date may have got to both of them, so hopefully if he lasts long on the show they become more comfortable with each other.
ooh, thank you for sharing! John B may have just become one of my faves, something about the way they interacted and he was smiling was so pure :”)
Thank you!
"They" heard that Zach and Jess were together as well!
Hello from across the river in Portland! He posted an update saying that they did the day portion of the date at Mt. Hood ski bowl and the night portion at Skamania Lodge in Stevenson, WA.
Yeah likely. I hope they go to Europe again.
![gif](giphy|3oriO99KfBG0Iuedk4|downsized)
She said she would love to go to Greece so I hope they make that happen for her!
That was the date at Michelle's parent's house. I believe he did confuse Brandon for Peter 😌.
One of the Aaron’s got 1-on-1 after winning a group date. And then it was Joey getting 1-on-1 after winning a group date. Not sure who got first solo date that first week. (Still in LA mansion).  The Barbie group date 5 days ago was on second week. Edit: Brayden got solo date this week. We know that Sean got 1-on-1 from the Barbie group date. Don’t know if there were 2 solo dates or 2 group dates, not sure yet. (Still in LA mansion).   Third week is starting off in OR and WA right around now, or I guess they already started with a 1-on-1 this recent Saturday.
Thanks for the details! I figured Mt Hood was for sure. I wondered if they’d film anything at the waterfront
Omg that’s almost worse
I’m pretty sure someone got a solo 1 on 1 before Brayden but don’t know who
I think this is week 4, not week 3. The first 3 episodes are at the mansion.
They definitely missed an opportunity with the cherry blossoms!
Fixed my timeline! 👍 Brayden’s was posted very close to kissing group date which I know was Week 1 and everyone still has no idea who got a solo that first week. But looks like there’s a good enough 2-day gap in between for 2nd rose ceremony before Brayden’s date, so yea he’s in second week!
Yeah, it’s week 4 since this will be the 4th rose ceremony.
You’re going by episodes. I’m going by actual weeks. I don’t count first night as week 1. I know it’s confusing lol. Yes, this is episode 4, but in literal sense, it’s the third week.  Edit for those downvoting:  https://preview.redd.it/3v334nn7nqra1.jpeg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=62813d27ca4a9524adf2b50488359cd09280dc86  This was posted yesterday. Like I said it’s Episode 4 they are currently on.  Night one - Episode 1 with RC 1  First week start to finish - Episode 2 ending with RC 2  Second week start to finish - Episode 3 ending with RC 3  Third Week start to finish - Episode 4 ending with RC 4  Like iSaid, confusing but in real time it’s third week right now but will be presented as Episode 4; and that’s what I’m going by when I was listing out the dates for each week 👍
Just wanted to say Ali is someone who talks the talk and walks the walk wen it comes to these things, out protesting again,  shes been advocating since uvalde   https://preview.redd.it/gamh4or16rra1.jpeg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=744dcd8b024cc3f1fbc78cf8ebe1f50d82e1c62f
Listening to Rosecast’s recap of the last episode. Am at the part where AB shares the news about Fleiss leaving the show. Rim’s response “is he going to jail?” is cracking me up. 😂😂😂
Listened to Jason’s 100th episode with Kaitlyn and it was a great good listen. She was truly broke as shit when she went on the show and is now one of the most successful bachelorettes. I’m surprised the show paid her $1500 between finishing the bachelor to announcing her as bachelorette. I wish kaitlyn would share her numbers.
Jason during his podcast when Kaitlyn says Shawn dragged out their relationship to start his gym and business  ![gif](giphy|xT5LMPj8P20jjOqZ5C)  &#x200B;  (Poking fun at all the theories here he’s only with her for the clout. Behave yourselves…)
Found that interesting as well in a recap I read.     Tyler Cameron shared a similar experience post filming Hannah’s season. Now easily one of the most lucrative non leads. It’s no wonder there’s hardly anyone actually finding love though. It’s all a spectacle for the opportunity!
I hope we get a recap post after part 2 comes out. This was an interesting episode for sure!
He did seem not thrilled when KB said she wouldn't go into a business venture with him.
KB seems too smart for this. Tbh I felt Shawn felt more for her than Jason does and I wasn’t a Shawn fan but nothing about Jason feels genuine to me  Tbh a few of the bachelorette are with men I don’t trust, add Rachel, and Becca, and Hannah b…  The men scream opportunists
Oo Clare if only you knew what was coming! I feel like she has a much more calm presence now when she talks about her husband vs the nervous/anxious energy in this clip.
Narrator: *the feeling was not mutual*
I still wonder what it was that made Claire so obsessed with this man… like was he just super attractive to her or what because she literally looked like she fell in love at first sight
Dale's reaction when she says "babies!" 😂 Dude belongs on r/watchpeopledieinside
I’m trying to gauge Dale’s sincerity throughout the whole thing— 40%, 30%, 50%…? I can’t decide. Still mind boggling that he kept going through the steps despite seeming like a deer in headlights the entire season.   Only in BN will you hear a newly engaged couple say— ‘we’re excited to get to know each other more.’
Omg Chelsea from LIB is this
The way Dale just pretends like he didnt hear her say she wants his babies is hilarious. And then I love that CH calls him out immediately! What a mess.
I think everyone but Clare knew he wasn't that into her. Yikes.
Deer in the headlights look in his eyes when babies enter the conversation. Perfectly encapsulates the real reality of reality TV.
Her clock was TICKING. Their age gap just emphasized that he was in his party and play phase and she's in crunch time. This was doomed from the start
If you guys haven’t realized Claire is the real life Jan Levinson Gould
Chills. So glad Clare finally figured it all out but woof that was hard to watch go down
Oof, I forgot how awful this was to watch 🥴
He might not have been ready for serious and their timeline was crazy accelerated for an engagement but I do think Dale liked Clare a lot. He didn't have to propose to her. And I think they tried again once after they broke up. UO: there have been more forced final couples than Dale/Clare.
Always forget about these two lmaooo this was insane, even for the bachelor franchise it was so insane
I’m still mad that I was SO excited when she was chosen, I was defending her and rallying against the naysayers that claimed she was too dramatic and her season would be too messy 😭    I love her but my heart sank when she fixated on Dale so quickly. He seemed -so- uncomfortable and confused with her obsessing over him from the beginning. Everyone here could tell he wasn’t that into her but played along out of guilt/obligation/panic.     I wish she had never stalked her cast’s social media and  just allowed things to unfold organically :( Dale is handsome and seemed like a good guy, but they were not good together and it was a train wreck. I’m glad she’s happy now though!
It was so awkward when he proposed. Chris Harrison basically said she’s expecting a proposal. Like you HAVE to get engaged to leave the set of the show even if it’s week 3?? And his proposal was so short and vague because he really didn’t know her at all. They’d spent so little time together.
Ohhh Clare. She was the most lacking in self-awareness of any lead. It’s hard for me to wrap my head around why she couldn’t check herself on attaching herself to Dale so quickly and just how cringey the whole thing was. Especially being 39. I’m close in age to her when she was on the show and she acted more like she was 16 to me. Anyway I’m also more happy for her than anyone that she found love, she wanted it so badly. But damn haha.
Bless Clare and her eternal optimism that made her a little too blind in her hopes for love. I’m so glad for her that the man she did eventually find and marry seems to have the same energy for her, though. She was a little OTT with the naïveté on the franchise sometimes, but that’s honestly a part of the reason I was really hoping for her to find what she wanted.
He was already so done with her ☠️
It’s my time to remind everyone when i said he wasn’t acting like an engaged man (he hooked up with my neighbor) and everyone was SOO mad at me on here and saying it was “disgusting” that i wasnt supporting their relationship LOL now just to see everyone saying it’s clear he wasn’t into her from the get 🙇‍♀️ ok off my soapbox now
It feels weird watching back on this, but I like to think that their Bachelor experience led them to where they are today.
I want to start by saying that I have nothing against Clare and I am rooting for her. That said, I really don't think she has matured the way the sub believes she has. I was randomly listening to her interview by BHH a few days ago...(it was after her engagement) and she really took no accountability and accused Dale of "stealing" time from her. It really felt like she blamed him solely and completely and saw no value in learning important lessons from the relationship. It sounded bitter. Looking at interviews like this...I can absolutely see how someone could feel suffocated because I would have been. I wish her nothing but the best but that interview really didn't fully sit right with me.
- I don’t think it’s fair that Dale wasn’t being authentic to Claire. Perhaps it was the fast pace of the show and just not knowing what to expect with the whole process… but I don’t think he was ready to get engaged but proposed anyways. - I don’t think it’s fair that Clare did not warn Dale prior to the interview that she wants babies. Seems like they haven’t really had those major and very important conversations prior to this interview.
What’s Dale up to these days
Can someone tell me what happened with them, I missed the tea
He was almost choking on his words saying that the feeling was mutual 😬
They were both so annoying in this lol. They know this relationship is going nowhere and they’re not really getting along and they’re so bad at pretending they’re fine. Forget happy. Just fine lol.
I adore Clare. But her season was BIZARRE. The fact that she picked HIM (aka= not an adult), the way she handled all of that… the whole thing was SO weird!!
In every interview and every IG live, Dale stated he was not forced into engagement and truly loved clare.  I actually believed him. 🤷‍♀️
I will never forget that video of her trying to blow out a candle in front of him
Clare was not my favorite bachelorette by a long shot when I watched her season. I hadn’t seen her previous appearances before her season so that could have had something to do with it. BUT after how crazy her season was and her and Dale breaking up, I am SOOOO happy to see her happy and thriving. She really does seem so sweet.
my first experience watching clare was during this season of the bachelorette and i remember thinking oh lord this woman is neurotic and insufferable. i’ve checked out her insta a few times and she seems so much calmer and more stable with her current husband. not sure why dale had that sort of impact on her!
I know she’s married now but has she been the most engaged person on BN?
this what the first season i watched when my girlfriend put me on this show. man lol
If only we knew then what we know now...
Whatever happened to that guy she went on the first one-on-one with? He seemed genuine
Sorry ladies but y’all need to talk to your man about babies BEFORE getting engaged. Not everyone’s ideal partnership involves baby in the first 12 months of knowing someone. I have a friend who was happily child free for 10 years, wife gave ultimatum, now they’re having a kid and he looks absolutely miserable, like he’s already broken down. He’s drinking excessively, doing drugs kids did at 17, and is clearly not handling it well.   Just because babies are in someone’s plan doesn’t mean you HAVE to make it a part of yours. This scene is the ultimate cringe because it highlights how absolutely incompatible they were and how in lust Clare was.
Greatest season of the show ever
I had to stop even glancing at comments on Clare and Dale's posts during this time because I couldn't believe how NASTY some people were about Clare's age. I remember somebody commenting to Dale "I guess you don't want kids" because Clare was apparently Estelle Getty. In New York City, almost everyone gets married and has kids later in live and there ARE options if you can't have children naturally (egg donor, fostering) and I just thought it was so cruel and terrible to put a woman's worth on her ability to conceive a child.  Also people saying Clare looked like Dale's mom and stuff, which is absurd, because they look the same age, and if the man was eight years older, NOBODY would think twice!  Just a rant. People can be miserable and awful.  Glad Dale and Clare both seem to be in happy relationships now!
In my opinion, there was always something off about Dale. He seems like a disingenuous person, searching for any kind of attention he can receive. I definitely think he manipulated Clare.
I feel like there’s something “off” about his current relationship too. Can’t put my finger on it
Poor Clare C - she was always there for the right reasons
And what a surprise, they are not together.  Which is why when all those declarations of true love happen, even with Kaity and Zach, I laugh.  You just don't know each other in that compressed time period enough to say you love someone with every ounce of your being.
Are they still together
Definitely well spotted, she is way less neurotic about her now-husband which is a really positive sign.
I always thought this scene was gonna end with her jumping on the couch a la Tom Cruise.
I was thinking the same! Happy for Clare being with someone who seems to make her feel calm and secure, I want everyone to have that :)
I think she did some deep dives into her contestants Instagram during lockdown and saw how similar Dale seemed to her ( having lost a parent and being in a caretaker role with this family ) and also he’s an attractive guy. I think she probably built him up a ton in her head and obviously was smitten with him before he even stepped out of the limo
She blew up her own show for this man! It boggles the mind.
She was horny! Period. She knew nothing about him. It was all hormones and limerence.
She IG-stalked him lol
BayBEEEEEEZ!
Narrator: it was that moment that Dale realized he had made a grave mistake
0%
I was very against Dale, until I started following his current relationship (big Galey Alix fan) and he seems to be so good to her! She’s extremely reserved and guarded yet somehow ended up with Dale so I’m more inclined to believe now that Dale got swept up in it so fast with Clare that he had to just go along with it in fear of public backlash. But who knows, we’re just speculating from afar.
Clare is hot and nice so I doubt he wasn’t into her.
Spot on
Not gonna lie, I did enjoy Chris Harrison when he was messy and made things extra uncomfortable. So damn shady.
Bigggg yikes
My clock never ticked. I find it intriguing to watch other people go baby crazy.
And this is why she’s my fav bachelorette.
she has always reminded me of her! Thank you!! Haha
It's also giving me flashbacks to Scheana and Robrobrob 🤣
Yes!!!!
GIRL, we couldn’t say a damn thing about this couple even though the red flags were everywhere. I loved when Claire was cast because I loved that they cast someone her age, but then she started acting SO WEIRD and obsessing over this stranger who seemed SO uncomfortable and people downvoted me to hell lmao.   Like, both of them were off. He seemed shady and not into her. She seemed juvenile and obsessed. Meanwhile, after they broke up people were like LOVE IS DEAD. Huh? 🥴
LMAOO wait he hooked up w your neighbor while he was engaged to Clare?
PS go clare so happy she is with someone better for her now
Yeah, it just seems like revisionist history from her.   Guys on her season, such as Bennett have talked about how she was only 100% in on Dale, which was frustrating for some of them.   And now she's saying she didn't want to leave with him?
> accused Dale of "stealing" time from her  Girl??? Lmao this is so silly when she is the one who more or less hogtied him into an engagement. She stole her OWN time with other guys to be with him and shut down her own season to run off when they knew nothing about each other.
Exactly! She forgets that she gave him no choice. Production tried really hard to talk her into meeting the other guys and she was completely fixated on Dale. They couldn’t reason with her. She abandoned her season for a man she didn’t know at all. Like I said in another comment, if you’re The Bachelorette, you’re not shopping for a man. You’re being given the opportunity to meet several guys at the same time, spend time with them and see who’s more compatible with you. What exactly made her think that Dale was “the one” if she hadn’t talked to him at all? It’s weird to treat someone like the man of your dreams when you haven’t asked him anything about him yet. You know nothing about him. It feels very objectifying and weird.   I think this is something that happens more commonly to women. When a guy thinks you’re his dream girl and not once has he asked anything about you or has tried to really get to know you. But he’s SO horny for you and thinks you’re supposed to be down for it. No, it’s weird and it’s weird when women do it too. I don’t think Clare treated Dale like a person. She was just super horny for him. Idk, it was gross watching her sniff his shorts on national TV and never ask him anything about him.
What makes you think he was inauthentic? It looks like he gave it a shot
Dating an influencer who the internet has never seen without a hat on ever lol
Apparently, opening up a restaurant in NYC
It was super weird. He gets out of the limo and introduces himself and walks inside, she immediately says “that’s my person” and becomes obsessed with Dale. She fixated on him (everyone suspects they DMed or she stalked him on Insta before filming) from the very first moment and doesn’t give any other guys the time of day. She literally sneaks off to spend more time with Dale or is thinking about him during her other dates. She essentially tells Harrison like week 2-3 that Dale is the one and she’s certain. Harrison tells Dale that “Clare has picked you, you’re the one, she’s ready for a proposal and to leave the show.” Dale looks kinda gobsmacked, in shock. It’s obvious that he wants to stay and continue the process normally, but he goes with it. He throws together a short proposal since he doesn’t really know Clare that deeply. She accepts. This awkward af interview above is filmed. They leave the show.   He starts slacking with his commitment to her, going out, not spending a lot of time together, rumors he’s been cheating / out with other women. She’s photo’ed with and without her ring. They go back and forth, back and forth on if they’re together or not. Every week it’s different. Then iirc he posts a full on PR breakup announcement on Insta without telling Clare… he might have signed it? She’s under the impression they were still working through things. She’s embarrassed and devastated. This is obviously the true end now. She lays low for a while, he goes out more. Eventually she pops up and announces a serious relationship with someone new (her now husband). The end.
I some remember this
Probably because she sensed that he wasn’t as into her and it made her even more anxious and neurotic.
Not sure she’s actually changed much—- still remember her tagging Abigail in the post about her mother 😵‍💫
I think the most engaged person is probably Becca? (Arie, Garrett, Thomas) Clare was only engaged twice, to Benoit and Dale
Didn't he leave when tayshia arrived because he was still into Clare?
Jason Foster! seems like he’s basically just lived a normal life since the show
You can’t compromise on children. It’s just not possible.
It's fucked up for your friend to have a baby when he doesn't actually want one. But yes let's blame the woman here. Not saying she doesn't play a role in her own relationship but come on, no one forced him to stay in an incompatible relationship and bring a kid into the world
I think Dale might want kids, he just didn't want to have them with Clare.
Your friend sounds like he has very poor problem-solving skills. Maybe it’s good to find out early on that someone’s reaction to agreeing to something they felt pressured into is excessive drinking and doing drugs “kids [do] at 17.” Better to know now than when the shit really hits the fan that the guy can’t cope.   But thanks for the head’s up to us “ladies.”  ETA: in case, the poster I’m replying to changes his OP. The original post did not include any mention of mental illness, but that has evolved into the story.
Sounds like he made that choice.
Okay, I’m totally against ageism especially against women but there’s no way they look the same age lol. I would never guess Dale was 31 if it wasn’t displayed on his chyron. Dale looks mid-twenties tbh and Clare doesn’t.
I don’t like him at all and I’m the first to say he was there for clout and followers, but I also believe that he was put in a very weird situation the minute Clare fixated on him because we forget that while yes, it’s a dating show, the lead is not shopping for a man. HE has to be into her too. They need to both want each other. That’s why there’s several dates and they have to spend all this time together, talking, and ALSO meeting other people. I don’t think it was fair to basically corner him into proposing that soon. You could tell he felt VERY uncomfortable and it became a Cassie and Colton situation. If you leave, you’re ruining the season and becoming the villain. If you stay, you’re basically committing to something you don’t want. It’s a lose-lose situation and just because you went on this show doesn’t mean you have to stay with someone you don’t love. The whole point is to date and get to know each other.   I think Dale should have never gotten back together with her after the first time they broke up, and he should have been honest about feeling rushed and pressured. But people wouldn’t have liked that either. Clare was treated like a victim and a saint even though she acted like a weirdo her entire season. And this is coming from someone who was so excited for this season! Clare was a mistake. It should have been Tayshia from the start.
Clare never really gave Dale a choice though.
The rest of the guys in the house said that Dale was always giving empty advice like he was on a stage and talking like he was Tony Robbins. He’s just a cringe dude. Somehow he gets away with it because he’s attractive.
She has an anxious attachment style to the extreme, so I think she always just tried to push that she’s HAPPY AND IN LOVE so much, that it just doesn’t seem real.  Like hopefully she is happy and in love, but I wish she’d stop feeling like she needs to prove it to everyone else.
1000% agree. Super smart of them to choose living together and have a three-year engagement….
I call this the Jordan Catalano/Dylan McKay effect (apologies, kids, I’m old).   These mysterious guys who don’t talk (in this case, he couldn’t talk because she was looking at his filtered online content), have women projecting ideas of who they are onto them. Because they don’t speak enough to tell you who they really are (or correct you), it’s left open to interpretation. And women assume the silence is deep thought, not just an uninteresting or unengaged person.   Not trying to drag Dale here. I was going through my own stuff after they got engaged and didn’t watch their relationship closely. But it seems he’s just saying very little, and she’s assuming his lack of argument means he agrees.   I suspect he probably liked her and her energy. I like Clare for that. But they just weren’t the match she’d created in her mind.
This is exactly what happened. Watching his instastories day after day, from her burner account, and falling in love with him before even meeting. No one else stood a chance.  I wonder how things would've gone had she had a more traditional season, meaning she didn't get to know much about Dale or the other guys before arriving to the mansion. I think he still might've won, but she wouldn't have been so obsessed with him, and would've given other guys a proper chance.  I still can't get over her sniffing his pants on live tv. Smh.
This 👆🏼👆🏼👆🏼
![gif](giphy|GpyS1lJXJYupG)
I like them together too. I don’t dislike Dale at all, it just seemed like he got in over his head and fast with Clare!
Same, he had no shame when it came to stuff like that 😂
Haha yes I loved that aspect of him
Same. I’m content being the fun auntie.
Some women want kids. Clare always wanted that. Unfortunately, for women that clock ticks. Dale is a fuck boi lol Its sad she wasted 2 years on his dumbass but anyone with eyeballs could tell he was in this show for clout.
RIGHT?! i was downvoted to fucking hell right with you for daring to question their love
Yes!!! well, to be fair - it was before their announcement at least. People were speculating that they were no longer engaged, and so i commented re: my neighbor, and that’s when i was cyberbullied LOL
What is with the hat? Has anyone figured it out?
Dont dis Galey like that. She’s awesome.
Excellent recap; you just missed the part when they got back together *after* that messy, Dale-signed breakup. 😂
Yikes 😳 that sounds rough
Thank you kind stranger
Omggg I forgot about that. She was sooo unhinged
ooooh i don’t remember this, what happened?
Omggg I forgot about Benoit he was so sweet! Also can we talk about how winter games was superior
Ahh yes so they are tied but Becca just had more Bach fiancés haha
Plus twice before Juan Pablo’s season and once to her current husband (5x total, only 2 in BN)
Absolutely, I would never want to bring a child into the world with someone who wasn’t sure, even if it’s something I really wanted. Not fair to either partners and especially the child
This. He was kid free for ten years and in a marriage with someone he must have known would eventually want children. I don’t know how to feel sorry for this person? Lol.
When you are with someone for half of your life and they threaten to leave you over a baby, believe it or not, they go through with it - look at divorce rate and absent father rates. It doesn’t mean they’ll be able to sustain after, but the fear of losing someone you’ve known since high school can be terrifying. I have also been with my partner half my life, so I totally understand his fear of leaving vs having a child. She knows that he is not mentally well and is unable to be more than a paycheck. When someone is unwell in the marriage, often the other partner should be the voice of reason. Unfortunately she’s no longer on that same journey as him, so who knows what will happen. But as his friend who has known him since childhood, my concern is for him and me wanting him to stay alive.
I can see that. Either way, their reactions make it clear it wasn’t something they discussed clearly.
If his immediate reaction is to drink and do drugs to cope, it’s pretty obvious there’s an underlying mental health issue at hand. If he is afraid to talk to his wife or afraid to leave the marriage, that points to mental health issues too. Doesn’t excuse his behavior at all, not remotely arguing that. But your edit low key made me lol because mentally well people don’t do what he’s doing. Anyways, his wife is unfortunately about to be raising two babies. I wonder if she’ll stay once she realizes the amount of emotional labor she is doing for him.   And to the OOP: “Mental illness isn’t your fault but it is your responsibility.” I feel for your friend, but he needs to get himself some help…
He has a mental illness that his wife has been aware of that was something they worked together on 5 years before marriage. Because of his mental illness, children were off the table because he knew he could not manage through life without this. No sane person would have a child with his condition, and in the life he’s been able to build. He did not want kids and we all knew that, especially his wife. He self manages well and all I am here to do is show friendship and be there for him, but it’s not my place to give more than that. I support my friend and think it’s absolutely absurd that she pressured him into this.   Maybe instead of being defensive, understand that people live with conditions that render them unable to cope healthily, thus why they often make MATURE decisions to not bring a child into that environment.
Eh, I would definitely guess he was over 30.   She DEFINITELY doesn't look old enough to be his mom, though.
I completely agree. Clare seems like a genuine, good person, but people give her way too much of a pass on this sub.
I felt like Dale realized how attached Clare was to him and even though he wasn’t feeling it, there’s some pressure to have a show. So in his position I could have seen myself just getting caught up in it and then panicking and feeling super trapped. Imagine if the producers went to Dale telling him she’s here just for you and you need to propose and it was only week 3… imagine just cutting out like NOPE. I bet he wanted to but needed to provide material. It would have been interesting tv if he just said sorry and left though 😅
Thomas was also described the same was...look how that turned out. Some people are just self conscious and don't realize they don't thrive in that environment till they get there. Then you add the Clare fixation on top of that.
Maybe that’s it. Any influencer that only ever posts about how amazing their life is gives me red flags
My mom will still make jokes about "the boiler room". So clearly was a mom to teen girls in the 1990s, hahahaha.
Clare would totally believe she was Red.
Dale hasn't done anything else with BN even though I'm sure they'd be frothing at the mouth to get him back, and seems to spend most of his time doing charity work with his serious girlfriend. I don't really see the fuckboi or clout-chaser accusations.
I’m a woman lol. Without a clock. But yes he was not the right one.
No but I’m morbidly curious
Sorry can you explain how stating a fact that she never doesn’t wear a hat on instagram is a diss?
I think she thought Abigail and Dale hooked up?  https://www.reddit.com/r/thebachelor/comments/pyrcwj/clares_most_recent_ig_post_about_her_mom_why_is/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf
I miss Winter Games! I need to see more international contestants. The Bachelor Canada girls are GREAT. Well, the girls from the last season they did. Such a fantastic cast. What a waste to not invite them to BIP or do another Winter Games. If they want to make the show exciting again, they need to do more of that.
If we’re counting all total engagements, I think Nick has had 3 also! One pre show, Vanessa, and Natalie now
Clare has been engaged 5 times!
Damnnnn really? I was thinking BN only at first but I didn’t know about those first two
Your response is pretty gross. He made his bed. This is NOT the woman’s fault.
I actually see the opposite - that they’ve had many conversations about it and Dale is annoyed and embarrassed with her pushing it and Clare is oblivious
Incorrect. Dale sold her a dream and then switched up the second it was real.
So why did he never get a vasectomy? I'm sorry but if you know you could never handle having a kid then you should do something to help prevent that.
I am not defensive thanks. I’m long-married and done having kids.   Your friend had two adult options: when presented why the ultimatum, say “no”, and/or get a vasectomy. If his mental health is as fragile as you describe, he should make the choice to get sterilized to preserve his own peace of mind.
She’s shallow and not very bright… if she truly wanted a good man she had that French Canadian dying to be with her for years. Forgetting his name
that's bc BN exiled him. BN loves Clare. Not sure why. But they do 🤷🏽‍♀️ and also every post of his is, is some form of marketing. Chasing that @ money
Agreed! Definitely the best spin off of the show!
Yas loved Winter Games (minus the rigged figure skating comp). I liked having more international cast members. More jacuzzigate!!
Emily Maynard has had four engagements! One pre-show, two from the show and one from her now-husband.
Oh yes how could I forget! I used to think Nick and Clare would be perfect for each other
To who else?!
You must have missed the part where I said he has a mental illness. He is not able to think logically and rationally, and often has paranoid delusions.
Do you know a lot of people with severe mental illnesses who make rational and logical decisions regularly? Because that’s sort of the whole premise of what a mental illness is.  He is the type of person who thinks the government is going to chip you.
Personally I have to wonder how strong she is if she’s just always rambling about how strong she is, and how she “won’t settle!”
Benoit! I wonder what happened there
Who exiled him? He’s hung out with contestants here and there. Producers would certainly *love* to have him back because a man like that is going to cause chaos. He’d have been the first person on the beach following his season if he wanted to be involved again.  Sharing your projects and business endeavors separate from the show isn’t clout-chasing. It’s the people who want to extend their 15 minutes and specifically suckle on the teat of their show appearance(s) that are considered clout-chasers. People like Nick or James Taylor. People who go off and use their platform to pursue their own careers out of the BN limelight and out of the entertainment industry in general are not clout-chasers.
How is this at all relevant to Clare's situation? Because according to you, your friend is so mentally ill that he's been incapable of making rational decisions to the point where he can't even understand what a vasectomy is. It's not at all comparable to Clare and for another thing, with every comment i'm even more baffled that your takeaway is to blame women and to say we need to change our behavior around men. your friend needs a lot of help and support, probably treatment, and appears to have gone without any of that for years. it has nothing to do with simply not having a conversation about babies.
I guess I’m confused why your one specific story about one very specific instance of severe mental illness, began with the phrase “sorry, ladies“ and what seemed to be a warning to women to stop pressuring men? I guess there is a chance that any woman on the street could end up with another man with severe, untreated mental illness and addiction issues. But that’s not really a broad “sorry, ladies” warning story, or a Clare-related story. It’s more a “my poor friend” story. We have an off-topic thread in the sub btw.
I actually do know a handful of people with severe mental illness who have managed to not have children. He was with his wife for half of his life and she never got pregnant before, he knows how to prevent babies.
Yeah, I don’t know… the poster has said that the wife who supposedly badgered his friend into having a kid knows the friend is “unable to be more than a paycheck.” Huge MRA/MGTOW vibes to me there. I have known and been related to a few people who (as the poster describes in a couple of other posts) have paranoid delusions and think the government has chipped them etc. I’m unsure how that level of disability— which also does not allow his friend to even understand what a vasectomy is—allows for a large enough, steady enough paycheck that it’s the incentive to have a child with this particular unwilling man. He may be the most brilliant person on earth, but if he’s able to keep steady, remunerative employment, he’s a bit of an outlier. Odd story….
It’s not about knowing how to prevent it. Lol there is no educational issue here. I’m glad all the people every single person on this sub fits into the monolith opinion of what someone with a mental illness looks like and I’m glad y’all know excellent coping skills at work, but not everyone is a monolith of mental illness and some people need more support than others.
I think I prefer her with darker hair.  Might be the lighting but the new color makes her look pale
I wish I had the guts/boob size to wear outfits like that
yall coming at her haircolor like shes not allowed to live in peace with her own preferences.
Lol I love her sense of humor
The hair!
Whoa
She looks stunning!!!
I am sooo glad that Gabby gets to make choices for herself and that she doesn't give two hoots about what we think.  Certainly there are those whose opinions make a difference to her, but it certainly isn't any of us on Reddit!  As if we have a say...no charge for dreams.
Gabbys still is literally “ wear less, totally”
Her shoulders looks very pointy
blonde suits her, tbh. it makes her look more youthful.
[removed]
Y’all know she’s said previously that that’s a natural blonde right? To all those commenting that they “prefer her hair darker”
Does anyone else believe that Rachel’s recent breast reduction was because of her inner insecurities comparing herself with Gabby?  During their season, Gabby consistently had a great styled wardrobe and was repeatedly complimented online. Meanwhile, the styles that Rachel wore didn’t accent her beautiful curves. Instead she got a lot of negative online comments.  She also seemed to frequently judge herself harshly compared to Gabby during some of the episodes because of her perception at the guys’ interest in her. And I’m sure it hurt to read some of the unflattering comments as the season aired …. But most of the negative comments were because of how the show’s stylist dressed her, not her personally. Interestingly, the comments dramatically changed after the AFR episode, and as she started posting beautiful pics after moving to Cali and was wearing her own clothing. So I was shocked when she posted about the surgery. I don’t mean this disrespectfully at all. I myself am a curvy girl and frequently am envious of girls to have smaller hips and chests because they can wear anything and look absolutely gorgeous. I have trouble even wearing a simple button-down shirt because of the size of my breasts. I end up looking like a toad because the shirt hangs down like a tent from my chest, and makes me look 40 pounds heavier.   The thing is that all of us are unique and individual people all and we all have different body types. I really hope that she is happy with the results of her surgery but I also really hope that she can be happy with herself in general, and doesn’t let her insecurities over her figure and curves convince her that’s why she has difficulties dating.
Ya. This post is totally about her hair color. Ha. Gabby has boobs. We get it.
I agree, but I also think it somehow makes her tan look too much at the same time? It reminds me of the mid-2000s stereotype of girls who would bleach their hair and frequent the tanning salons to look as “sun-kissed” as possible. Gabby is gorgeous and can pull off anything but I think she pulls off dark hair better.
It really washes her out.
Girl, I wish I had small enough breasts to wear outfits like this. But my H cups could never. 😭
Amen to that. I always laugh when I imagine what I would look like in a top like that.
Not everyone can pull off every color it’s not that crazy that some people have opinions! You are also on Reddit lmao
The blonde is starting to grow on me! I didn't like it much at first, but she's looking pretty ethereal.
I have shoulders like that, can confirm they’re very pointy lol. I’ve gotten numerous comments when receiving massages.
Her natural hair color isn’t nearly this light. You can scroll way back on her Instagram. It’s a honey brown.
No. Rachel said she has wanted a B.R. for literally yeaaars
Gabby definitely could have inspired or encouraged her to go through with the breast reduction. She did say somewhere that she’s been wanting one since high school… But I’m sure there was also a bit of fear there. Sometimes people have bad results or don’t heal well.   A breast reduction surgery is also a dream of mine. I have H cups and my style is more along the lines of Gabby’s top. I just want to wear cute spaghetti strap and backless things but I can’t with boobs that nearly hang to my belly button without a bra haha.  If I were on a season with Gabby and seeing what she could wear and I couldn’t, it would probably inspire me to get the surgery ASAP too.
Firstly… the post was about her outfit and the ethereal glow radiating off of her face. Secondly, I’m a straight woman so I’m not boob-obsessed. If all you can think about are her boobs when you see this, then… 🤷🏻‍♀️
I was going to comment but my E cup would seem like a joke to you.
If I bent over in that outfit my entire chest would be out lmao I’m so envious of flatter chests. Idk why people want big boobs they’re not great
this is not a matter of her not being able to pull off being blonde. she can clearly pull it off.
I still don’t 😞
I hope you get the opportunity to get the surgery 💜 I had to wait about 15 years and save for it, but, even with the scars, I’m so glad I did.
Put a x on the center of the shot. 🤷‍♂️
LOL, honestly anything after a D is kind of a curse when it comes to fashion.
They are NOT great at all. I would get a breast reduction un a heartbeat
They’re really not… I’m hoping I can get a reduction one day soon and walk around with cute spaghetti straps and no bra haha.
I think most people here aren’t saying they don’t like the blonde just that they prefer darker on her! That’s okay!
I prefer the brunette look on her too. I think it suits her better. Was she blonde or brunette on Clayton season?
I still like her brunette more… idk, I just love a girly who keeps her natural dark hair. But I definitely don’t dislike the blonde anymore haha.
She looks like every other blonde girl in the franchise
so is that she cant pull it off or that they prefer her brown hair cause youre contradicting yourself right now
She was brunette but she's also shared on social media that her natural hair color is much more blonde
I agree brunette suits her way more, although she recently said blonde is her natural hair color and TPTB made her dye it brunette for the show
she is naturally blonde though. the roots were always there
How so? Besides the hair color?
![gif](giphy|DZyxZgmcbC264)
She has a photo when she first went dark again and captioned that one “back to my roots” so I’m confused lol is she naturally blonde or not
I think that was a joke. There are a few photos of her as a blonde in the past with grown out dark roots, and when she went brunette again in 2020 she literally captioned it “back to my roots” on the reveal photo haha.  https://preview.redd.it/g2c90oxnqora1.jpeg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=aaa6d45da074184f7c36c480745818f1bc2ae05f
Agreed that darker suits her much better. On DWTS they showed a few pics of her from high school and her hair wasn't as dark as it was on the show but she was definitely brunette. If she prefers it lighter than her natural brown I think the Broncos-era highlights are better than what she's got currently -- I feel like the ultra-blonde doesn't work with her skin tone at all.
![gif](giphy|7UyiYeDdLFIW3yX3Id)
I think she has naturally lighter/honey brown hair. If you scroll way back on her Instagram you can see it. So the very dark brown isn’t her natural hair color, but this light blonde isn’t either.
how can’t both things exist at the same time ? Lmao girl
I didn’t say she was naturally platinum. I was responding to the commenter who said she was naturally blonde. Her natural hair color is a light brown, and she’s said brown in her natural color.  https://preview.redd.it/nw4l4tg0uura1.jpeg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=728f424a65a4ec5dcd56c1b6a740624c57b5d660
because the first statement isnt true in the first place which is why you changed your argument. though "this is reddit" so i am getting used to arguing in circles and knowing when its not worth it anymore...  ![gif](giphy|KctrWMQ7u9D2du0YmD|downsized)
First statement was general about how people feel when other people change their hair colors. It’s natural. The second was in response to people’s comments in this thread after more time. Idk why Gabby’s hair color or people commenting on it is so important to you. You: “Queue Reddit with opinions on someone’s hair ” YES ITS REDDIT ITS A PLACE FOR OPINIONS. Girl I’m done
Literally every time I watch ATFR or WTA I think of the Hunger Games!!
I shed a tear laughing at this 😹
Stanley Tucci said he watched “certain reality shows” to prepare for this role and I do think his character has so many Chris Harrison mannerisms and little things. He played an exaggerated, unhinged version of him that’s reeking of insincerity, like Chris.
Lol thank you. It felt very accurate to me 😂
Her last name is blitzer yall late af
I guess when you’re Jewish yourself, you catch onto others being Jewish lmao. Specially with the last name Blitzer….. Also some of these comments are wild
All I know about Greer is that she REALLY REALLY loves tea and will cry if she doesn’t get it lmao
I thought people knew this. Her Ashkenazi surname + her family posting observing Jewish traditions
Love how whoever sent her this was trying to Christian girl kiki with her and she’s like nah fam
She’s already said she’s Jewish before, I’m pretty sure she mentioned it on the first episode during her introduction part or whatever
So now are ppl gonna start shipping her with jason too?
Whaaaaa??
I mean her name is Greer Blitzer which is a very Jewish name. I don't know why people would assume she's Christian. And what a weird question from the fan. Favorite book of the Bible? Making a lot of assumptions.  Maybe they assumed her Black face debacle meant she was a white conservative MAGA lover. She's probably all those things; she's just also Jewish.
Greer is a very Jewish name so I’m not very surprised.   Ok but also who tf is asking Instagram influencers their favorite book of the Bible???
“Both sets of parents” 🤔🤓
Huh not surprisingly,  just found out I'm Jewish  all around . Ukrainian Jewish, Italian jewish. My Italian last name means Hebrew Please don't come at me but it was definitely a find.
I know non white and non Christian Trump supporters. People of all races and religions and genders can be ignorant/racist, (and grow). Don't put ppl in a box!
I’m super surprised. Then again I know that TPTB can only barely handle a maximum of one Jewish person per season. Or maybe she just didn’t care to share
A Jewish trump supporter? Not something I would have guessed about her.
i actually had no idea. between the blackface scandal and trump endorsing i just figured she was another middle american white woman with the ol traditional christian values but…the more u know i guess 😭
This has been known for awhile, yeah. Not much discussed though since it didn’t come up on the show.
Forgive my ignorance, but does she mean that she is Jewish ethnically or religiously? There is a difference between claiming a religion nominally and actually practicing it.
why surprising? i know TPTB are bigots but it's not like the contestants are self hating
Why does her religion matter again
Half of the Bible is books Jews know and love so idk why she didn’t answer lol
Could just be of German descent.
Lmao when they showed the tattoo I died.
lmao same
Lol
My Ariel - Jason shipping has more to do with them both seeming like they are well-traveled-rich-liberal
Being candid that her actions were racist and publicly being furious at abortion restrictions makes me think her heart is in the right place
She called her past actions racist at WTA - I doubt she's a conservative MAGA anymore. I'd be shocked if someone MAGA did that. I think she was just young and dumb.
Greer is Celtic  Edit: I meant the name is Celtic
It is? I'm Jewish, never heard it before
Honestly knowing this shows fan base not shocked at all loo
I thought it was a celtic name? That's the only other context I've ever heard the name in?
I’ve never heard of a Jewish Greer
Right? What a stupid question
Really? I’ve never heard of it as a name. Do those of Jewish faith try to name their kids after biblical folks?
grandparents, maybe?
Wow,  cool! I just learned recently that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright didn't learn she was Jewish until her 50s (her parents converted after escaping Czechoslovakia during WW2). I imagine it must be disconcerting to learn late in life about something that's such a big part of so many people's identity!
Why would someone come at you? Lol   I’m just curious if you don’t mind sharing - but how did you just find out you’re Jewish on both sides? Wouldn’t that be something you saw expressed as a kid?
How interesting! Welcome!
Yeah that doesn’t discriminate.
You’re putting her in a box with this comment though?
This sub over states how much religion is discussed on the show.  There are many contestants we never see discuss it.  From a range of backgrounds and then this sub just makes assumptions
There’s a ton of conservative Jews who LOVE trump because they think he’s “good for Israel”
Every Netanyahu supporter is usually a trump supporter ( cough my father ) most Jews are democrats though. Tikkun olam and all that. The trumpies tend to be super orthodox or hasid, similar to Evangelicals.
I know anyone can be a Trump supporter but I guess I just assumed because she’s from Texas and was maga that automatically meant Christian.
Ivanka did marry into a Jewish family, so maybe that's where some of the support comes from?
Same. (Jew myself) Any jewish MAGA fans care to identify yourselves for proof of concept?
Is she still a Trump supporter, or was that when she was younger/lived in the south?
Just because she’s Jewish doesn’t mean she still isn’t trump endorsing racist
Jews can be racists too…
It seems like she's grown up a lot
she doesn’t explain either way but it could be both, or she could be non-practicing at this point of her life!
The fact that this is heavily downvoted says a lot about this sub. If someone is trying to learn, encourage it. When people are punished for asking questions, they stop asking questions.
She doesn’t provide enough information to infer either way.
Could be either I guess. I am ethnically Jewish meaning I have some Jewish heritage, but I don’t claim the religion, even from a cultural perspective. If you ask me what religion I identify with the only answer you’ll ever get from me is “none” or “agnostic” lol. So to me they are two very different things, but it depends on the person I guess.
Not necessarily. It's complicated.
Uh. This doesn’t matter in Judaism. It’s an ethnoreligion.
I don’t really see why it matters….
if you can’t figure out the answer to that question based on this screenshot alone, why do you think we could?
Well, considering she didn't answer the question (aren't there books in the Hebrew Bible?), I'm assuming she's not that religious? Although I don't know if Jewish people have favorite "books" like some Christians do.
you must not be a jew, but for fellow jewish people, it’s FASCINATING to discover when other people are jewish, especially when you didn’t expect it.
Well they made the central part of Ariel’s story about her Judaism. Greer just liked working and was really sad when she got covid.
[removed]
Your comment makes no sense lol
What makes Ariel less Jewish?
How is she truly Jewish?
What does this even mean? I’m so confused. 😵‍💫🥴
Greer isn’t from NY, she’s from Houston.
New York over California? Must be #1 and 2.
She did answer the question, she doesn't have a favorite book of the Bible because she's Jewish.
She's mentioned on her stories before that she's Jewish.
I think you’re confused we call it the Torah. Her answer was appropriate. We don’t have a Bible.
I went to Hebrew school for 7 years and still attend services occasionally. Legit couldn't tell you one book anymore - not even my Torah portion 🙈. Genisis..?
Jewish people don’t call it the Bible. That’s why.
You’re talking about the 5 books of Moses. I’m not gunna lie it’s annoying af to be told by Christian’s it’s “the Hebrew bible and you love those books!” Like no it’s not a bible. It costs zero dollars to be respectful
So if someone asked what you’re favorite part of the Torah is, you’d have an answer?
We don’t have an “Old Testament”. We have one Torah.
I mean I think she's picking up on the fact that the question is asked by a Christian who assumes she is Christian.   For the record Bereshit is the best book of the Torah lol
It’s not “the Old Testament” in Judaism. That’s a Christian-centric perspective. She didn’t answer the question because it’s not relevant to her since she doesn’t practice Christianity. She provided context (she’s Jewish) for why she wasn’t answering the question.
So if someone asked what you’re favorite part of the Torah is, you’d have an answer?
Me too 🤣🤣 she was in tears and I was in tears from laughing 😆
I was screaming when I saw the tattoo and it looked like something you’d draw on yourself back in 2012 🤣
![gif](giphy|l4EoRjS6gq9Yh9ahO|downsized)
That’s like everyone in nyc
Yeah-- I was shipping them partly bc they're both Jewish, I admit, but I also think they both seem mature, smart, and intimidatingly sophisticated. Ariel also reminds me a bit of Jason's sister,  so I think she would fit right in! I can't see Jason and Greer-- somehow she just seems MUCH younger to me.
Also thinking about how she grew up in conservative areas; being young, dumb, *and* impressionable is quite a combo. It seems like she earnestly wants to learn, grow, and change and I think she has the space for that now. I feel like a lot of young people tend to do and say things their peers/community believes in at the fear of being ostracized. Albeit that’s still not an excuse for what she did but perhaps just an insight into why
I’m not Jewish so I can’t speak to personal history of it but I spend a lot of time lurking on r/namenerds and I have seen it mentioned as a commonly used Jewish name.
I’m Jewish and my middle name is Greer.
Why is it stupid?!
Jews don’t call it the Bible. Their collection of scriptures is called the Tanakh.
To the same degree anyone else does
Or step parents? Not sure
My Ukrainian fam as well converted to Ukrainian orthodox during ww2
Sounds like they mean they are ethnically jewish, but their family isnt necessarily religiously jewish
It’s only about 20 to 25% of American Jews though. Most of us are Democrats. Has been that way as long as I’ve been alive and I’m in my 40s.
Zionism really is a new concept on this sub huh 😂
Hi from a fellow child of a Jewish Trump supporter, I feel your pain
I'm in a sorority with a Jewish girl from Waco Texas, and she is 💯 republican. Her parents are from Israel and love Trump.
Surprise! Anyone from any religion can be hateful. Christian, Jew, Muslim, atheist, agnostic…
Yeah, I assumed the same thing.
Definitely makes it easier for them to justify the support.
My parents, sadly. Ooof.  Also my orthodox cousin (baal tshuvah).   And,  unfortunately,  most people who vote for Bibi in Israel.
My Jewish in laws voted for trump the first time and highly regretted it. Most Jews I know (including myself) are liberal.
I’m pretty sure my boomer relatives and their friends are not on Reddit but trust, the concept has been proven too many times over in my own life (sadly).   And I’m from New York. Any white, wealthy person from Texas being a trump supporter should be 0% surprising.
i used to babysit a wealthy jewish family who lives on the uws of nyc. the dad would give me rides home after the gig and would go off about how much he likes trump
Half Jewish, grew up in Long Island.  Unfortunately quite a few Facebook friends from my hometown are big Trump supporters.  I don’t get it.
If you’re familiar with Real Housewives, Siggy Flicker was on New Jersey for two seasons. She’s an absolute batshit MAGA, J6 crazy, self-professed Jexit supporter.
I know a few VERY MAGA Jewish people. Granted I don’t know many MAGA folks at all but 2 women I know who come to mind are conservative Jews. It takes all kinds to make a world, I suppose.
Most Jewish response ever ❤️ thank you
Thank you. It was literally just a question. Guess I’ll Google it.
It’s not called the “bible” in Judaism so there’s really no need for her to answer that?
Lol very true. And then when we meet Jewish people we try to figure out which other Jewish people we mutually know haha
I may not be Jewish but i must link [my favorite bit of media](https://clickhole.com/only-some-people-are-jewish-1825124001/) to joke about with my Jewish friends when this comes up
Does she have any relation to Wolf?
She also really loved tea.
I think this sub made Judaism the central part of Ariel’s story lol
Mentioning her Judaism a few times makes that her entire story?
Uh. It’s just representation. It has nothing to do with Ariel.
Literally what
They’re also not called bibles though lol. It’s the 5 Books of Moses and you nailed it! Lol genesis is one.
No I’m talking about the Torah, the Nevi’im and the Ketuvim. My girlfriend is Jewish, I’m not trying to be disrespectful here.
Yeah… I definitely would. Lol. It’s Genesis if you’re wondering. Didn’t realize this would be such a hated response, I’m actually pretty suprised reading it.
It would be an answerable question even if I said I don’t have a favorite one. If someone asked my my favorite part of the Quran I’d say I’m Jewish. If they asked me my favorite part of the Bible I’d say I’m Jewish. Make sense?
I always like to say I don’t know shit about the sequel
I’d say Genesis and Exodus, but point taken. That was ignorant of me. Not Christian by the way.
But not everyone on the show.
Thank you for name dropping that sub. If I ever have a kid, now I know where to search their name lol but wait also is that the right name for the sub? Looks like it only has two members?
Well for one you are assuming the person gives a shit about the Bible like its a given.
I didn’t know that! I thought it was called the Torah
Yes thankyou that is what I meant.🥰
I have some Ashkenazi Jewish present in my tests but I’d literally never claim it since it’s like 3% lol. I see what you’re saying. There’s actually a hilarious South Park skit about that which I won’t link here but look it up. 😅
Yeah there are a number of very loud jewish conservatives but jewish women are one of the most dem leaning groups in the country (IIRC the only more dem leaning group is black women)
Lmfao I’m glad the common idea of Jews is that we’re all lefty but it is simply not the case
Or they’re just commenting surprise because the vast majority of American Jews are democrats? Like over 70%.  Also, not all Jews are zionists. And not all zionists believe in full blind support of the Israeli government. In fact, most Jews I know (including myself) support the idea that israel should exist, but are highly critical of the Israeli government.
Yeah, orthodox are definitely more inclined to support Trump and Netanyahu. Greer certainly doesn't seem orthodox. If she isn't still a Trumper (which I'm guessing she isn't since she called her past actions racist) then I'm guessing the Trump support was just from when she was young and dumb.
At least they regretted it! My dad still thinks the 2020 election was stolen, oof
I don’t understand why some people feel the need to be snarky, pedantic, talk down to others, impose their own personal absolutist viewpoint on the world, etc. Your question was totally fine and valid and no one needs to be rude.
Interesting, that’s not really my experience. I’m a Jew in NY and most of my Jewish friends consider themselves ethnically Jewish but atheist/not religious. They observe all/most holidays and traditions, but aren’t religious. If anything, I think the ethnic vs religious dichotomy is somewhat unique to Judaism. Not that it really matters at the end of the day, but I don’t see it as an offensive or outrageous question.
Seriously. The down votes seem to disagree lol 🙄🙄. And then people complain about why this sub isn’t equipped to discuss Israel and Palestine.
lol, I need to send this to my mother
This is everything. Thanks for sharing.
Yes, in bachelor nation, it does.
Hahaha I was looking it up last night. I thought I remembered the number 5. I was so proud of myself, lol.
TBH your girlfriend being Jewish doesn’t make you an expert? Lol. Your comments come off and condescending
LOL that’s hilarious
Jewish people don’t call the Torah, Midrash or Talmud the Bible. So that would just be weird.
My bad just fixed it I was missing the s lol it’s really fun looking at what people plan to name their kids and pets even though I don’t plan on having kids for another 10 ish years
r/namenerds
Torah is part of it: Genesis - Deut
Yeah,  I give people passes for things they do when they are young, dumb, and trying to be edge-lords. She might also have been influenced by her parents.    My dad is in his 70s and reform, fwiw.
Not mine either, also a NYer. I don’t get what people are so confused about-ethnicity is a fixed point; it’s what’s in your blood, it’s how you were born. You can however determine and declare your religious beliefs, cultural affiliations, traditions you do or don’t practice, etc. With Judaism they don’t always go hand in hand- one can claim the heritage without the religion/culture/whatever, or vice versa (such as a person without a drop of Jewish blood who converts). It’s a really interesting conversation and personally, as with anything in my life, I’d rather be asked than have assumptions made. It’s definitely not offensive or outrageous to ask IMO.
[removed]
Not trying to be condescending, I just don’t understand.
Meh. I'm sorry. That's gotta be hard.
Well you’re still Jewish even if you don’t practice or believe. “Declaring” is a Christian thing
Right, I think we’re agreeing that the lines are blurred, but disagreeing that it’s somehow outrageous/offensive to ask. It’s just a question. And while no one particularly cares about the distinction from a judgmental standpoint, it is still a distinction unique to Judaism. And, unfortunately, does have some practical consequence (e.g., you have to be practicing to become a member of a synagogue typically, and on the flip side some antisemitic persecution cares more about the ethnic-side of things).   Idk, I think when i say no one cares I mean no one (at least in my Jewish circles) makes any judgment about it, but it can be interesting to talk to fellow Jews about. I personally find the different ways of being Jewish really fascinating. I was just perplexed people seemed so offended by the ask, since it’s really not out of bounds to talk about in any way in my experience (maybe that’s more of an NYC thing though, idk).
I don’t think it’s a bad or ridiculous question though. Some people are ethnically Jewish and don’t consider themselves religious OR observant of culture practices/holidays. It’s an individual preference really and personally I would appreciate being asked the ethnicity versus religion question as I am very anti-any organized religion for myself personally and draw a clear distinction between the two.
I’m really confused by what you’re saying. How is being ethnically Jewish somehow Christian-centric? That’s kind of offensive, tbh. And honestly the idea that Jewishness is both a religion and/or ethnicity is so uniquely Jewish, I’m really not sure how you’re bringing Christianity into it. Can you elaborate? I’m really not following.
That’s kind of what I am saying though. One’s ethnicity/heritage is a fixed point, even if they don’t claim associated religious beliefs or traditions. With Judaism a person can claim one or the other or both; it’s a bit murkier than with other religions, to the best of my knowledge. Idk about “declaring” as a phrase being a Christian thing, so replace it with any similar word that suits; I just don’t feel comfortable identifying with or practicing any organized religion, whether it’s Judaism or Christianity or anything else.
I don’t think it’s necessarily offensive, but she clearly stated she is Jewish, so I don’t really get why nitpick whether she is “claiming it nominally or actually practicing”
[removed]
I think "declaring" is a Christian thing in that,  according to most Christian sects, you have to declare your faith to become a Christian-- you have to "accept Jesus" or be baptized or get communion or something like that.  According to Jewish law, you can become Jewish one of two ways-- you can be born to a Jewish mother (some forms also say Jewish father,  traditionally it's only the mother, though) or you can convert, which is a long and difficult process involving lifestyle changes,  study, and interviews with a panel of rabbis. If you are born to a Jewish mother,  by contrast,  you are considered Jewish by Jewish religious law even if you never practice Judaism or in fact even if you convert to a different religion.   Ethnicity is just a bit different-- in my case my dad is Jewish but my mom converted (reform) long after having kids,  so I actually went through the orthodox conversion process in college.  My kids were born 100% Jewish by Jewish religious law bc of this; "ethnically," they are 3/4 Jewish, but "religiously" would not have been considered Jewish by most interpretations of Jewish religious law if I hadn't converted before they were born. My nieces and nephews are 1/4 Jewish by ethnicity (a fixed point), and technically wouldn't be considered Jewish by Jewish law, but whether or not they choose to claim some Jewish ethnicity/identity is up to them. Had they been ethnically 1/4 Jewish but their mother's mother was Jewish, they would technically be considered 100% Jewish by Jewish law even if they were practicing Catholics.   My read is that Greer is claiming a strong Jewish identity here by emphasizing that she is both ethnically and religiously (according to religious law, prob also to some extent by religious practice) 100% Jewish.   Happy passover everyone!
That’s not it. I’m Jewish. The RELIGION is by birth, as much as an ethnicity is. A Jew can say “no thanks,” but, according to Judaism, they are still Jewish. But it’s NOT an ethnicity because there are dozens of Jewish ethnicities.. most Jews in the US are Sephardic or Ashkenazi but there’s Eritrean Jews from North Africa, Jewish tribes in China etc. it’s a religion. But it’s defined by birth and not belief. We are used to thinking about religion as defined by belief. That’s the Christian-centric view. Many Jews in the West don’t even get this bc we grow up around Christians. It’s not MURKY. But it’s different than what Christian’s understand as religion
Ethnically Jewish isn’t nominal. It’s an ethnicity. Judaism can be both an ethnicity and a religion, or just one or the other. For example, I’m ethnically ashkenazi Jewish but I’m not religious at all. I don’t think the distinction matters in terms of, say, determining someone’s actual Jewishness, but it can be totally relevant to a Jew’s identity.
But how is it ridiculous/naive/ignorant? I really don’t think any apply, speaking as a Jew (if you don’t mind me asking, are you Jewish? I’m just curious). There is a distinction between ethnic/religious Jewishness (some Jews are both, some are only one). For example, I’m ethnically Jewish, but if someone assumed I was religiously Jewish, that’d be inaccurate. It’s not something you can know just from looking at someone, so better to ask than assume, I think.   Just because the distinction doesn’t always matter doesn’t mean it never does, to anyone. And asking certainly doesn’t = they have no awareness in Jewish culture. And I really don’t follow how asking a uniquely Jewish question reinforces Christian normativity? I may just be misunderstanding your point, but I’m genuinely not following.
I would say there’s also the difference between those who’s families have been in the states longer than recent immigrants. A lot of friends who’s families moved to the states generations ago are less culturally jewish because of how prevalent and default Christianity is in this country. Friends who’s parents or grandparents or they themselves are immigrants tend to be significantly more culturally jewish in my experience, as the communities abroad were more insular.
I mean, neither was I, and I think it’s important to let people self-identity and speak to that rather than have assumptions made about them. Personally I don’t feel comfortable with religious practices of any stripe and would appreciate being asked about the distinction between ethnicity and religion- I’d appreciate being asked and encouraged to speak for myself rather than have assumptions made about what I do or don’t practice, participate in, etc. If you think it’s a ridiculous question then just…don’t ask it. I’m not trying to argue here, just wanting to show another side.
There are absolutely Jewish subgroups, which is actually pretty common in various ethnicities. An ethnicity can stem from (among other things) shared traditions, language, or, in this case religion and land of origin (Israel), with possibly very little shared genetic ancestry presently. What you’re describing is not inconsistent with the concept of ethnicity at all. So Jewish ethnicity (and various subgroups) may stem from, in part, a shared religion, but that does not mean it’s not an ethnicity or that all people within that ethnic group share the same religion. There are ethnically Jewish Christians for example. That’s the point, Judaism is not just a religion and not just an ethnicity, it’s both.   And a big part of that stems from millennia of persecution and forced migration, and Jews essentially existing for centuries as a diaspora. That’s significant to why judaism and Jewish identity is so unique. So I’d imagine most Jewish people who identify as ethnically Jewish identify with the traditions//cultures/language of their subgroup in particular, with the shared ethnic identity of . That’s pretty normal. If you’re Jewish and personally identify with it a different way, I think that’s totally cool for you, but part of what’s fascinating about Jewish identity is a lot of Jews will define it differently.
I can say “no thanks” to religion, as a nonbeliever and a person with agency. I don’t particularly care if someone who feels differently doesn’t agree with me; I’m explaining my perspective and how I feel as an individual. Honestly, how is coming at a stranger saying “that’s not it” going to get you anywhere? Good day.
I’m not saying it’s not a thing…I just don’t get why if someone says they are Jewish we wouldn’t just take their word for it? Like if they want to share more, great. If not, why not just leave it at that.  Eta: I was quoting the OP, I never said it was nominal.
For what it’s worth I agree completely and think your take is spot on.
Ah I think that’s the disconnect. I don’t think asking about whether someone is religiously or ethnically Jewish (or both) is in anyway questioning the legitimacy of their Jewishness or not taking their word for it. I can’t speak to the OP and how they meant it (and reading their post again, the use of “nominally” is questionable). I’m more so pushing back on the idea that it’s somehow beyond the pale/ignorant in jewish circles to ask or talk about, when that’s not been my experience.
Nah, now you’re just sounding ignorant. I’m claiming ethnic heritage, not claiming religious beliefs/practices/traditions. I can have Jewish heritage without having been raised in a family with a religious identity.
“the end!” Lmao…girl…
Des and Jillian Harris are probably the closest to this archetype I guess. But yes I certainly can't think of a Bachelor who fits that mould and it would be interesting to see. At this point I'll take anything that isn't "played football in college" since that's every bachelor since Colton except Peter.
I know a lot of creative people and i think those type of folk would be either A) too down to earth and sensible to go on the show or B) entirely full of themselves and would not take direction.  Or you could get a comedian but they wouldn't take it seriously. 🤷
Nick wanted to be an actor, though I wouldn't call him particularly creative or artistic. They also considered Luke Pell, who shot himself in the foot by trying to make his season a vehicle for his music career.  I think the audience would be suspicious of a lead who was openly in the film industry. People would likely assume they were just there to boost their brand or gain connections. That's why they often tweak their job titles, like calling Katie a "bank marketing manager" even though her primary gig was TikTok comedy videos. Some friends and I got scouted for a reality show about friendship a while back and they asked us all to come up with non-acting professions for our application even though most of us are actors. I think reality shows actively want to distance themselves from the idea that the people on them might have a foot in the field already.  I also personally find men in film insufferable in their own way, but that's my personal trauma. Art bros are just finance bros with less money and glasses.
It's not about the field. You can have boring people in finance or the arts; you can have interesting people in finance or the arts. No reason a finance person can't visit a film set for a date (especially when the producers set up the dates).   They just need to cast people with personalities. Someone is who funny, interesting, and engaging.      The short-cut they get by casting the types that they do is that a) they are coachable, b) they don't outshine the contestants (where the real drama comes from) and c) they don't actively turn off any the contestants or the audience. It's much easier to layer in a veneer of 'this person is a really great person/ready to settle down' when they are starting from a blank canvas than one that's already painted.
Justin could have been a great lead, and he was F2. and i am in the slew of people who found him unproblematic on BIP
Andi made her own dress recently for Amanda's wedding, so she has to be somewhat artsy haha
One of the finalists in Katie's season was a three time Academy Award winner and starred in some classics, if that counts?
Don’t give Peter too much grace here. He played in high school
They kind of tried the comedian with Bob Gurney (comedian)
I don’t believe Nick wanted to be an actor when he was cast on Andi’s season. By the time he was lead, he had moved to LA, right? Or shortly after did.
He was a software salesmen when he first got cast but I think he always planned on leaving his day job. Not sure exactly when his actual acting aspirations started.
I thought he was still at that job, even with Kaitlyn. I’m not saying he didn’t want to retire early or work less (who doesn’t), but I got the impression on Andi or Kaitlyn’s season (can’t remember which), he was pretty proud of his job. Not that he shouldn’t be. Sounds like he was decent at it and made good money.  It seemed to me the show made him want to capitalize on the opportunity. Which is also nothing new. But back in Andi’s day, that wasn’t so much a thing as it is now. I think had he not gone on K’s season, he’d be married with a couple of kids, and living in the north US somewhere.
Hard to say since his LinkedIn says he's still technically employed there lol.  Nick seems to me like he's always been spotlight-hungry. If he wanted to settle down with a yard and two and a half kids, he'd have done that after Andi's season instead of going back on reality television. I do think Kaitlyn's season totally broke him in terms of a normal life but if he didn't already see the show as an opportunity he wouldn't have been on her season at all. Even pre-social media people did make careers out of appearing on reality shows.
Fair enough. We will certainly never know. I do disagree, but respect your differing opinion, and don’t think I’m more right.
Fair! I think we probably can agree that Nick has had quite the journey.
Yep, we absolutely can!
Arie and Lauren's date suggestion app is getting weird.
Also it’s like a six second ride. Idk why people spend money on it!
There’s a town named “Buda” that’s a quasi-suburb of Austin & I was so lost for a minute until I kept reading. *I didn’t see it say “Budapest” at the top until I fully opened the pic. Lol.   I was like, “WHERE IN BUDA IS THIS?! I’ve never seen it when I’ve been!”  I thought Kaity & Zach were in Buda or moving there. Lol.  Also: I thought I was in r/Austin for a second. 🙃
The walk up the hill is also very pretty, fyi!
I’m going to Budapest in a month so this was helpful! Would take any other tips from y’all that you want to share 🫶
The Buda in Budapest is actually pronounced Buda, unlike the Austin one 😂 I lived a year in Buda (hungary) and now live in Austin and the first time I made that mistake everyone shunned me lol
An unforeseen benefit to not being uber wealthy is that I am allowed to have color in my home
Do you think there’s enough neutral tchotchkes?
This looks more like a house done for staging for a sale than a home for a couple to live in.  It’s devoid of anything genuine and real.
Oh to be rich enough to be surprised by your own home decor.
Ya know, if this is your style more power to you. But personally, it’s incredible to me that anyone with their amount of wealth would choose to furnish their home with items that (while likely way more expensive than what I could ever afford) look like they could be bought at any big box store like target or cb2.
Whew, this is sterile.
I’ve never seen two people play grownup more than these two
I’m picturing gobs of self tanner all over the white furniture
Shocking there is no personality
This is all very 2015 but if they like it good for them
I wouldn’t say this looks cheap, but it looks extremely generic. Does their designer only stage homes for real estate cause it literally looks like it was staged to sell lol nothing in it is unique. I actually am a neutrals person in my home, but I am all for adding color in rugs, art, pillows or accent walls. You can still be neutral without being completely bland.  But good for them they seem happy
Why do rich people hate color
I hate these beige rich people houses
I’m definitely petty for this but it pisses me off that these two who have never had a real job can afford a house like that. I’ve worked my ass off for 15 years and I’m still years away from even potentially affording that, if ever.
I like some of the pieces, but it seems pretty devoid of personality. But I’ve never been one for a lack of color
Must be nice for this to be your first home 🙄. As a Christian myself I hate when Christian’s attribute their success and material things they’ve gotten to God. Doesn’t work that way or I wouldn’t still be single living in a 900 sq ft house.
I think my favorite part of any house reveal is the decorations that were seemingly out there just for show. Like the three books on the shelf. Or to use a different example Dakota Johnson’s bowl full of limes in her Architectural Digest tour
Looks like my orthodontist office
I am so over this trend of houses looking like sterile operating rooms. Like where is the fun and color these days?
The tea from the snark sub is that Troutt sr bought the house and put it in Grants name solely before the marriage. Thought that was interesting!   As for the design, I fucking hate it. To each their own but it’s way too bland for me. Then again I’ve had my house for almost 20 years and my living room has been 6 different colours through that time. I like playing with colour and styles. So obviously this ain’t my cup o tea
Glad to see that unlike all the other influencers whose houses look incredibly generic and inhospitable with all the spartan beige and white furnishing, they really created a warm and welcoming living space by adding black.
They just seem too young to have a house like this 😂
looks like a house a family from abnegation in divergent would live in
This looks like every other insta influencers house
This could not look more like I’d imagine it would
It feels very un-personal? Beautiful but in a very generic way?
The designer did them dirty or only has experiences in home staging ; it’s objectively bad, even for this specific ‘relaxed neutral California design’.
Tom Ford and Coco Chanel would be sad to be in that completely generic Instagram aesthetic house.
It’s just so tone deaf - putting this song behind this montage of completely impersonal decor branding yourself as a Christian influencer.. I’m a Christian and I feel like even though she’s really trying to sound holy, it comes off as… irreverent? I don’t even know if that’s the right word, but it bothers me.
All that wealth and they’re still decorating with that Tom Ford book?
I rolled my eyes so hard at the “Chanel” book that will never be touched and is mostly for instagram aesthetic. Everything is so fake looking
He looks like a 13 year old boy that hit the growth spurt part of puberty but nothing else.
This looks *exactly* like the house the Meijer nepo children (midwest IYKYK) built in my parents’ neighborhood  white mcmansion cookie cutter that epitomizes no taste, just HGTV and ‘resale value’
This looks like a showroom, not a house for people to actually live in lol
Why does he full-blown grab his wee-wee when he sees it and yell “nOoOoOoO 😍🤪💅🏼” like that….. be so fr right now
Always love dropping this biblical nugget on these greedy christian billionaires and their lavish lifestyles as they profit off an imaginary friend to people.    **Luke 18:25**  "it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God" (Jesus and the rich young man)
My favorite is when really super rich and Christian people you can tell don’t know much about their decor they are having put in their house.  Example - the Tom Ford 002 book they have. I see the original Tom Ford coffee table book in a TON of homes, and the first Tom Ford book has a LOT of naked men in it, some men on men naked. I can imagine Tom Ford 002 book he made similar stuff inside. So Maddi and Grant have this book for decor that has all this male nudity in it that you KNOW they would think is “sinful” in their house. Lol
I hate this cold, generic style so much. It could be anyone’s. To each their own but this is just not it imo
Cheugy af
There’s an influencer who created a pet toy company that sells beige colored toys because she didn’t like having colorful dog toys all over her house. This house would be perfect for those boring dog toys.
When did houses go from all white kitchens to all white EVERYTHING!! Couple of black accents, and then just white, white, white. Don’t have to go crazy with tons of color, but what happened to a nice accent wall here or there? Or some furniture that actually has some color?? I don’t get it
Trying to chill on how absolutely offended I am that a couple of twenty something's are walking through their mansion, surprised by all the new things that were bought with money they did not earn lol
Surprisingly basic.
This is just the decor I wanna see the layout, how many rooms, bathrooms, come onnnn
I think if I were working with a designer I'd want them to help me create a bold yet cohesive color palette throughout my home. It's something I'm not confident to do myself. We have one accent wall and now I don't know how to paint the rest of my house so it all kinda flows. All that to say, that's a lotta white, especially for a home a pro designed!
I cringe with the “eyes closed, tongue out” smile… every time
Wacko Texas
Every time an influencer says they wanted to “make their house into a home” they end up revealing a house that couldn’t look less like a home.
It’s so boring. It doesn’t look like a home - it looks like an AI-generated model house from a brochure for a development that hasn’t been built yet. I don’t think I even saw one photo. I keep my house clutter free and fairly neutral colour wise as well but i at least have some of our wedding pictures in frames
This is the hearth and hand section of target
Wow so humble & real
$100 says they eat boneless, skinless chicken breast for dinner with unflavored shaved ice for dessert.  ![gif](giphy|3oriffz82y6RzFYVLG|downsized)
It’s a beautiful home, no doubt, it’s just weird seeing 2 20-something’s living in a home like this. Clearly they both come from money, so money would never be an issue, but not sure how godly it is to show off your wealth in this manner.
I continue to be confused by this aesthetic. I'm not saying you have to go crazy with color, but where is the personality? Why are people so fine living in a house that could literally belong to anyone else? Every single thing I saw in the video is straight from a trendy tiktok video. No originality. No intention. Just "black and white with gold accent" copy-paste home.
What in the prosperity gospel did I just watch
The three books… and then a stack with the spines facing the wall…
*cries in poor*
incredibly basic :/
Why does the background music make me want to donate to the humane society?
This isn't a house reveal, it's an ad and you know she got a huge discount from that company for doing it. 😭 Literally nothing she posts is genuine and real.
Oh wow a white bland farmhouse glad this got revealed
It's boring and unoriginal but surprisingly practical (seems like an affordable home without tons of frills for Wacco)   Why do I always feel like these two are playing "grown ups?" They seem like little kids playing house
Oh, a bland neutral McMansion with Jesus decor? How unexpected.
It’s sooooo boring.
Looks cheap like HomeGoods. Nothing special :(
Imagine them trying to pray in a studio apartment
This house feels so cold still. Like zero warmth/homey/home feeling.   Also I’m no interior designer but if this home were a person they would literally be the type of person who buys everything brand name to look good but doesn’t know how to put it all together so the clothes wear the person, yanno?
I mean… it’s okay but like why did they need interior designers to create this look? HAHA It’s straight off Pinterest. The Tom Ford and Chanel books too like so damn predictable
The whole thing—furniture, color palette—is aggressively boring. So yeah, that suits them.
This decor is more basic than Zach Shallcross.
omg grant is just happy to be there…like a kid truly 😭
The type of house where I would be too afraid to sit on the furniture or touch anything
Every time I see Grant, my immediate thought is girly pop
No color at all 😂
I would be thrilled if she never showed up on this sub ever again
i can’t even imagine how cool my house would be if i had that kind of money lol i get they like this but damn, at least put a few personal and unique touches in
She is so young and vibrant, why not add some color and personality? Or are they afraid of the rainbow? Sad beige it is!
This is literally just an ad
r/tvtoohigh
The fact they moved to Waco and didn’t get Joanna Gaines to decorate is BEYOND me.  Edit: Spelling.
ok but im just surprised they didnt hire chip and joanna's company Magnolia since they're in Waco and pitch to have it be an episode of a show or something since madi is so thirsty
Imagine this being your starter home 🤯
Exactly as beige as I would’ve expected
It doesn’t look rich, it doesn’t look comfy, it just looks boring. Also trizzy is wearing a crop top
why is everyone so afraid of color
Ok, initially I was happy for Madi meeting her person and thought people on this sub were just being haters but the more I learn about this couple the more weird I find them.   Madi seemed like such an intelligent, together girl on the show and now she seems immature and stuck in her young adult influencer stage.
Why does every influencer live in the exact same house?!?!?! 🤯
I don’t get the all white instagram houses with people who plan to have little kids running around. They’re going to need a maid there 24/7 to deal with that situation.
Me, waiting for them to have children enter into <all that> 🤭
Someone get this man a stylist
I learned the word “cheugy” on TikTok and it has never described anyone better than Madi & this house.
They still have to live in Waco 🫠
I just don't understand where all of your actual stuff goes. Like don't they have anything that needs a place? It's all fake books and clear surfaces.
I am envisioning a $3000 beige Goldendoodle puppy in their near future ✨
All the cat hair we have would really pop in a house like this
Isn’t a tenant of Christianity supposed to be… humility?
It’s SO BLAND
There is such dissonance between how young they look and dress and their house, which seems like it could be owned by 50-something empty nesters.
the giant empty teacups are sending me though
goes to show that being rich can’t buy style 😟
They must feel so accomplished after working SO hard for this.
It looks like an AirBnB…
They could have kept their Wedding Guest Seating Chart Headstone as an art installation in their home. Would've fit the neutral decor lol.
Does anyone else look at every item in this video and assign a price to it that’s like a hundred times what you think it should be
Looks like the house equivalent of a mayo sandwich
Geez it's boring AF 😴 😒
Do you think they know that their designers basically just recreated a CB2 catalogue from 2021, image-for-image?
How long until Madi gets pregnant and then starts family vlogging?
There’s nothing I’m less interested in than watching rich randos flaunt their wealth.
Looks like my obgyn waiting room 👀
How sad that designers and/or their clients see books simply as as decor items/space fillers, rather than as an enriching and transporting treasure chest of words and stories. Spines to the wall says it all. The books’ insides aren’t even relevant, or so it would appear.
White and black…emphasis on the white. My god. It’s so white. And so boring. The floor doesn’t even excite me. They have buckets of money and their interior decoration is just so bland. That frame over their bed is un-inviting. Put a whatchamacallit over it. A canopy thing so it doesn’t look like you have a useless frame.   I’ve been watching a lot of home renovations and this sterile, hospital white is not a home. And it just lacks any personality. And what even is that table she’s got her laptop on. It feels like it’s not wide enough.   If I had their money, I’d be doing a hell of a lot more with it.
It’s giving basic
Not me liking their sad beige decor over here. 😂 I’d at least add some soothing sage green or something to break up the monotone but I don’t hate it!  What I did find funny though is that she said that now their McMansion is the perfect place to worship Jesus, without a trace of irony.
Jesus approves the background music to the crib tour.
Cheugy
This looks like a very nicely staged house. Hopefully they won’t keep it so generic, and they’ll add some personal touches
Is their house where colors go to die?
Why did they need to film this? And madi’s reaction lmao. “Omg I’m so surprised the things I picked are here!”
Sad beige children are definitely in their future
God bless this grift🙏🏼
They really couldn’t do that themselves? It’s literally just white walls and basic ass artwork..
this is a house where you can reflect on your sins
I’m glad we’re talking about this. I saw it a few days ago and thought it was horrendous in every way. There is not a scrap of personality or love anywhere to be seen in this home. It’s the blandest, most try hard influencer house I think I’ve ever seen.  Nothing says “we love Jesus” quite like a book shelf with books that literally just have designer brand names on them. Lol.  These two are a joke
You ever get anxiety by how clean a house is
That TV seems too high
Cries in poor
"Home design" or "Pier 1 Imports going out of business sale" 🤔
This looks like when you go to tour a show apartment, like you could have furnished this house at WalMart but I bet everything is insanely expensive. Side eeeeye
Is it bad that I already knew how their house would look like before watching this video? 😅
So impersonal and boring. Do rich white people just not like color and warmth and cozy?
It’s fine and all and good for them but that is just way too austere and colorless for my taste. There is no warmth, no personality, nothing that feels inviting or cozy. Maybe I’m just too poor to get it lol.
really frustrates me when rich people have boring taste and no creativity with how to use alot of rooms
This is one cold looking house. Def needs *color* . Very sterile and boring
only rich people/influencers would be (possibly fake) surprised by their new home decor. I'd be checking up on that shit every single day to make sure.
I mean...it's nice...if that reflects who they are as people then that's all that matters.  However, curated, neutral, and basic is what I'm getting.
the way i would be afraid to touch anything in this house 😬
Thanks I hate it
I’m sorry- they are both so very unlikeable and also so out of touch with reality.
Honestly, I know this is an ad, but based off this I’d never hire that decorator she is shilling.. I can get all this crap from Hobby Lobby, Wayfair, Amazon and Target (no shame). Then I can use the same color paint for every wall in the house BAM! Just saved money and didn’t have to let someone else take the personality out of my home…
I can’t get over the irony of choosing a song with lyrics “And I know it's not much But I've nothing else fit for a king” while showing off your mansion. I understand that’s not the point of the song but still.
I know interesting design is possible in Waco because Joanna Gaines exists. Say what you want about her style but she would never put out this cold, impersonal, bland aesthetic. This isn’t even interior design, those ladies just flipped through a pottery barn catalogue and up charged afterwards.  Studio mcgee (bLECH) wouldn’t even put out something this lackluster and that’s saying something.   I can appreciate minimalistic design preferences, but come ON.
Idk why but I just absolutely despise him and I feel like she’s really unhappy but putting on this ultra curated, happy front which makes me sad.
All is see is new build blandness. Books they will never read but are only there to fill shelves and signal wealth. A bunch of decor items with no connection to them as a couple, individuals, their travels or histories. I am pro getting a designer but it feels like they just need an instagram ready house, not that they wanted to fill it with things they loved.  Oh and I see a sexless marriage lol
So generic.
So basic and boring!! If I’m hiring sometime to design my home I would have expected a lot more than the bare minimum
Honestly, I don’t mind a neutral color palette when you have great walls like this to display art. But all their art is decorative art, which is so generic. This home could be great if they start to collect real art (doesn’t even have to be expensive! They can discover new artists, etc). Unfortunately, I think the all beige and all generic thing is here to stay. But to each their own.   He’s just so immature. Sigh.
Well they couldn’t possibly have any colors in the house that are also the colors in a rainbow..what would the church say???
Is putting a Tom Ford book up there a joke?   Like, has Madi seen Nocturnal Animals?   I sometimes don’t understand when, for example, a conservative person idolizes The Beatles or Rage Against the Machine but nothing says chastity until marriage like Tom Ford!
It’s so……….boring
Where is the FLAVOR?????
Kind of boring imo
I get so weirded out how some people can publicly show their home like this.  ![gif](giphy|26gsopeEQIyNsIj84)
Just as bland and boring as their personalities.
Just when you think Madi can't be any more vapid and phony...
Bland and white, it’s perfect for them!
Sad beige baby vibes
Must be nice to have this much money lol
major uckers
Sad beige houses for sad beige children.
Lmfao at the voiceover "to make things feel more homey" as they are styling monochromatic fashion books and black and white candle sticks like can u b srs
Nothing quite like romanticizing Waco 😂😭
it makes me incredibly uncomfortable how young they both are with a huge fully decorated & renovated home that was definitely mostly funded by parents
The dining chairs look kinda cheap lol
What is that guy’s job?
It’s so boring and beige that I feel like it’s hurting my soul
Houses that are just all beige make me anxious. Just so cold and devoid of happiness.
I love neutrals but this interior designer doesn’t seeem to be that good.
I have thoughts.
Where’s THEIR stuff?
The home and decor look exactly how the generic Christian music they’re playing sounds  ![gif](giphy|TlK63EI7rtUu9IAyxTW)
The Christian music playing over it is just so strange to me. God didn’t have anything to do with the way you decided to decorate your house?
No thanks. I hate the beige minimalist aesthetic that’s so popular right now. It’s so boring. No personality, no color, no joy or sense of livelihood. Sure it’s “nice” but it’s so sterile and trying to sell me something.  And the way they’re showing it off like they’re proud of it is laughable. Neither of them put a single ounce of effort into that mansion. Mommy and Daddy paid for it and then hired someone to style it for them. They’re so annoying.
Sad beige house with sad beige decor, for sad beige couple
Money can’t buy taste 😕
how exactly is any of this turning the house into a home
Yikes! This is very HGTV staging vibes. No personality. I'm 38 and bought my first house in 2018 and it's very personal to my husband and I. We have self-taken pictures-turned-canvases all over to remind us of all our memories together. To each their own, but this would not feel like "home" to me. The outside is nice though!
Oh my gourd.   Welp, I'm glad she's pleased with it.
I never wanna see these people again
I really need Reddit to introduce a keyword filter because the next time I saw either of these faces could be on my deathbed and it’d be a day too soon, just can’t with them
Why does he walk like that??? 🥴
Tacky is as tacky does
Looks like a West Elm. Do they not own any personal items?
More like “turning my house into a model home” lmao
They would live in Waco 💀🤢
This is shitty design with no personality-perfect for them
Looks like a cookie cutter Airb&b
Needs more gray to bring the gray accents.
It’s a beautiful house and I get the minimalist vibe they were going for with the decor. Hopefully, it’ll make more sense as they live there and some of the random stuff gets replaced with the items they actually use.   I hate every outfit he wore in this video though.
Was anyone else expecting satan to pop up in between them when they were kissing on their bed?
What do they do for money?
There’s no way this house is actually in Waco. Must be outside…
Black, white, and gold…. 💤
I don’t want to be a hater, but this is the most basic decor I have ever seen 🥲 With all that budget and Collabs and they get THIS?!
Ready for this beige studio McGee phase to be over
Extremely predictable home lol
Sad beige house for sad beige purity
This house is as bland and boring as they are
He is so not cute I’m sorry
What is in Waco? All I know about it is the branch dividians cult…
the desk and entryway table 🤢
I can’t
What's up with the low-budget editing?
Well like they always say “money can’t buy taste”
Must be nice to be young, good looking and rich.  Sigh.  I will never own a house.
That black framed marital bed is quite the choice. Satan approves
thanks i hate it
As a mom, it is simply fascinating to me to see how people without kids decorate. What’s it like to have sharp corners and to be able to leave candles on the table?? 😂   Seriously though, it’s not my style but it seems to fit them well. The interior designers did a good job.
Everyone talking about how rich they are but I sorta assumed they didn't pay for any of this lol - especially if they tagged any brands / interior designers - with a million followers I feel like it could've been free.
Why rich people hate being cozy?
![gif](giphy|JKCgYjL74Z3p4IutkI)
Wtf is he so excited about? Even the flowers are white.
Nice house. Curious how they ever are giving back? As a Baylor alum, Waco is filled with areas they could be helping out. But I fear they are stuck at HC surrounded by people who look just like them and are too busy talking about sex to care.
The foot pop really reminds me of the Princess Diaries
All his shirts appear shrunken…too wide and too short
Billi with an ugly influencer house? LMAOOO
why people pick furniture that has no drawers i will never understand. where do you keep all your junk?!?!?! also grant always looks like a giant man child to me
Influencers get upset when people talk them or dox them or show up to their houses but continue to film stuff like this. When will they grasp how stupid and incredibly dangerous this is? Showing the inside and outside to your house is just asking for stalkers/burglaries
It’s so ugly
As someone who has never been to Texas, can someone tell me where it is in relation to Dallas or Austin? And what kind of neighborhood is it? What Cali city/neighborhood would you compare it too?!
Oh to be FU rich...
Tom Ford book is a must have.
She needs to do something about those ratty extensions
Is my house ugly? 🙁 I can’t afford the whole White House ascetic that’s in
In case any of you are curious, I found the address of the place via a deed search (public records). They bought this home for nearly 1.3 million.
So boring. Give me Galey Alix all day over this.
I showed this to my girlfriend and said to her “promise me we will never live in such a beige house”
While this isn’t my style, I have the most issue with the bedroom. It’s like an ikea catalog or something. Desperately needs some color.
This is so ridic
I might be the odd one out here - but I love the minimalistic chic vibes..
Her decor is like the Wish version of something with a vision. God they have bad personalities lol.
I like it well enough but I’m a basic design neutral beige boring betch
Rich people don’t get into heaven as Jesus was pretty clear on so try not to flex too hard
Beautiful starter home most people can only dream of.
I wish I was rich
I wish I was rich 🫠
Grant reminds me of cousin greg
I am gagging.
No one cares
Lol. Posts about these two always have SO many comments.
I hope they fucq on every surface of that house and ask Jesus for forgiveness after
More money in this 20 second video than my wife and I will make on our lifetimes. Dope 🤟🏼  I might be super jealous but that’s a very nice home and good for them.
These comments are ridiculous. Home is beautiful.
Honestly lots of it are very lovely. And love that mint   candy apple-esque nail color
It amazes me how they continue to be the most talked about of anyone coming off this show.
I mean, that's Jack McBrayer, right?
[All I can think of ](https://youtu.be/asnQGz7BdfI)
sorry but i think it’s beautiful 😬😂🤷🏻‍♀️
It’s beautiful.  I just want to know what he does for a living?  I couldn’t afford something like that.
Pretty!
Real rich would be having a huge house and only 1 story though
Lmao everyone hating on them in this thread. The house is amazing. Hate on, haters
I didn’t like everything, but I think it’s a pretty home.  I’m glad she shared it.
Beautiful!
It’s so beautiful!! I love it
Jealousy isn’t a good look👀
wow praise God, so happy for her!
She’s got a great ass
Look check it out here: Madi + Grant’s  Home Tour (Photo is here as well) https://www.31chapters.com/madi
Their house looks like a realty company's model house unit - and I don't mean that in a good way.
Our homes are allowed to look like we actually live in them, lol
You’re allowed to use color when you’re wealthy too. The caveat is that you also have to have style.
> I am allowed to have color in my home  Color is just Satan using his tricks to lull you into a sense of comfort.
Yep. I wish my house looked less like the “messy mom” half of a wife swap episode, but at least it has personality.
Nuetral Tchotchkes is the name of my punk band.
Been trying to figure out how to spell that word for such a long time
Nope. Needs like 200 more at least.
I see what you did there
😂😂😂
Literally thinking the same thing.
💀💀💀
My husband 3 months after I buy something new for the house 😂
And it took me 2 months to psych myself up enough to spent $200 for a new bed frame 😂
Totally agree. They seem to love it so that’s great. But I feel like if I was working with a design company, I’d want them to help me find more unique things that really communicated some personality. Maybe that’s this for them, but it just looks so bland and cold to me.
Right? He’s the son of a billionaire and you’d expect more from people with that kind of money. If I had that much money I’d want my house to look like it came out of a page of architectural digest not 2018 HGTV
If you actually click through to the designer’s page, some of them are from cb2.    But I wholeheartedly agree.  It’s… not well designed.
So spot on. It’s actually an insult to cb2. Downright awful
yup honestly I think a lot of people could accomplish something decent looking with a white gold black palate.
I’m pretty sure I have the same fuzzy blanket as them (on their bed). It’s from Pottery Barn and the best damn blanket I’ve ever owned.
Money can’t buy taste
I guess I really don't care much and if I'd be rich I probably show of also... but then I wouldn't be spewing Jesus all around when he particularly said that the rich won't go to heaven...   I don't like cognitive dissonance...
It looks like season 1 of Dream Home Makeover - Studio McGee for Target all over it
These designers made absolute bank by picking out the blandest shit known to mankind.
As someone who works for CB2 - about 40% or more of these items were purchased from CB2! Mind was blown the whole time - they can afford so much more, so why CB2?!
Or "homey" as Madi calls it.   The guy with the povvo reels on insta was just remarking recently that you know someone is rich when their home has no color, lol.
Yeahhh. If they like it, good I guess, but if I paid a designer a whole bunch of money and they just decorated my house as if they went on [Houzz.com](https://Houzz.com) and clicked through the top results for "contemporary room inspiration," I'd be...very disappointed...
💀
Pls they look like literal teenagers
Hahaha I feel like you nailed it
And mascara
Like the depth of their relationship
Came here to say the same thing. And while most of the comments are saying “must be nice to be rich”, I don’t think it feels particularity high end. In fact it looks like one of those mass produced homes with stuff from Pottery Barn. Not exactly AD material.
That’s about right for evangelicals. They always seem to be about 5-10 years behind style-wise. They’re like Canada that way.
Honestly, it actually does look cheap. The scale of the furniture and the tchotchkes is all off and the decor is super dated.
Sad beige house for sad beige couple
well they didn't afford it, his dad did hahah
I feel this, I’m also a christian and my husband and I busted our asses just to have the small two bed home we have now
THIS. My moms family is quite religious - also all her siblings are more well off than us. At 13 I got really into religion because I thought that if I loved god he would make my life better (Aka my family would just magically become richer). Obvs didn’t work.
This is the prosperity gospel they’re following, not the red letters. They only think they’re Christians. If they were truly wanting to follow Jesus’ teachings, they wouldn’t have that house in the first place. That money would be better spent elsewhere like helping those less fortunate.

Yeah - I feel like it makes more sense in a styled photo shoot like Dakota Johnson’s (HOUSE ENVY!) than in a “furniture reveal to the homeowners” like this was.   Thanks for mentioning Dakota’s house tour though.  That was really fun to tour through and a good antidote to this one. 🤣
Bekah is the only one that comes to mind honestly
Omg 😂
even though it’s trendy i love the look of persian rugs against neutral floors, at least it adds color in
Whats the snark sub called?!
Papa Troutt is protecting Grant’s assets. There’s a lot more tea on the snark sub about how Madi basically set up the right people to hook her up with Grant. She’s basically a gold digger of the highest level and she thought she hit the mother lode.   I feel like these two are gonna have a messy breakup, especially when there’s so much money involved
Property records show Madi listed as an owner.
😂
Lol, this is a good comment
This is unprecedented levels of irony
Holy crap accurate!!!
IM DEAD
I actually expected more farmhouse. Surprised by this
Coco Chanel is a nazi so maybe we shouldn’t be too concerned with what she thinks
Yeah also Christian and there's something about her. I get why people are driven away from Christianity by people like her. It's so tone deaf. I feel like all she does is show off
Right?!
I will never understand why ONLY new money influencers have the Chanel/Tom Ford books (about what??) in their cookie cutter homes…gives the most boring vibes ever
Less charisma than a pair of khakis
Try to picture him with a mustache or goatee lol
I’m cracking up rn
Lol Grand Rapids? A Van Andel is building a house a street over from my parents (they’re in Ada) that is apparently going to be the biggest house in Michigan. 🙄 I’m sure it will be similar.
I heard that nOoOoOoO in Bo Burnham’s voice
And then they hit you with “it’s not having money that’s a sin, it’s the love of money” as if you can be filthy rich without absolutely loving it lmao
So get this. Their retort is that the eye of a needle refers to a narrow gateway in Jerusalem. So while it’s not impossible to get into heaven, it’s just a little more difficult. 🙄
I just looked at the sample pages on amazon and you're exactly right lmao. Good thing they'll never actually crack the book open!
Most accurate description ever.
Nah cheugy would be the live laugh love aesthetic
Ew what? I hate that.  Dog toys should not have to be aesthetic
Same here. I’m working my ass off for much less. Very far away from owning a house and I’m in my 30s. ☹️
Surprisingly? 😂
Why does she think this is cute?!
It looks like a house someone would build in The Sims.
AI generated 😂
I recently experienced something like this at a dinner party recently. First taste of the food and I received a fake call from my mother that I needed to come home and help look for her pet bird.
I completely agree. My theory is that it’s a trauma response from the pandemic — that sounds ridic I know, but I’m not joking 🙃 I feel like people want control and calm and low risk everything so they just create a beige little world where nothing bad (or good) happens. No interesting art to make you think or books or artifacts from the travels people couldn’t really have over the last few years—just visual calm that is also extremely dull
It’s crazy to me that they’ve literally had no life… like no artwork they’ve found in their travels or books that theyve read or plants that they’ve tended to? They paid someone else to make it “theirs” and make it “homey”… Like everything is an “accessory” devoid of any life or story. It’s actually just so unimaginable lol
😂😂😂
Omg yes
SUCH a surprise reveal 😍 Mass-produced recreation of every bland showroom house in the country 🫶🏼😩 #blessed #godisgood #thankyoujesus
Hahah they do seem unusually young.
The front walk with the giant concrete squares makes him look like he's been shrunk to "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids" size. 😂
You’re not the only one. I’ve never understood the hype
My thoughts exactly 😭 Not a single thing in this house is sentimental, unique, hand-me-down, or vintage. Not that you have to have that to have a cool house but it all looks like mass-produced crap from Amazon.
All Jesus freaks design their house this way… monochromic…. Just beige and grey :( sad
I’m guessing that the design team they went with gave the a discount for exposure.
That would have been smart.
It really does look cheap which is bizarre because they have more money than they know what to do with, at least hire a good designer.
Fixer upper was such a PR stunt it is such an ugly, boring and surprisingly dangerous town coming from someone who had to live in Waco for a summer internship in 2018.
My spouse and I bought a custom cover for our couch (the original velvet wasn't compatible with having a slobbery dog) and we partially tested the sample swatches by rubbing them on our dog and seeing how well it masked the fur 😂
Can confirm as a fellow cat lady with a light color scheme
Wanna-be Lauren Luyendyk for sureeee
That white furniture is going to be fun to keep clean when a baby comes
![gif](giphy|80TEu4wOBdPLG)
It costs so much to have someone design your home as well that’s a huge additional cost on top of all of the interior and furniture costs. It does seem odd to at they flash this around with their religious leaning following. It would seem like you would not flaunt this if that is your brand but I’m not religious so maybe it is accepted? I don’t know
😂😂
Pier one had more color than this!!
Yup, it looks like staged furniture and decor and they’re viewing the house for the first time.
Lol at how I was looking for those exact three things in my comment before I saw yours 😅
If you want to see rich people who like color, check out Lily Allen and David Barbour’s brownstone  https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/lily-allen-david-harbour-brooklyn-home
Not everyone likes color. It can feel overwhelming
Seems like an accurate reflection  Edit: minus “curated”
I cackled lmao
Cults need a place to call home too you know.
That city is a nightmare to drive through. That's the only that stuck out about it, and I was there only 2 years ago.
I was thinking they don't look comfy at all.
Billionaire’s son
smiling and pretending to look happy
Having the most punchable face
Yes I agree. I swear all we see on instagram are these all neutral homes with expensive furniture. I like that my home has furniture, art and decor that my husband and I curated ourselves.
Don't slander West Elm like this!
Nepotism and instagramming
His dads a billionaire
Yeah what the heck. They look no older than 25 but have a million dollar home.
Zero sex appeal but she didn’t marry him for his “good looks” lol
🤑
He looks 16
As a Texan, Waco is kind of a shithole tbh lol. Mostly just known for Baylor University and The Gaines Family/Magnolia Brand/Fixer Upper. But it’s a small town with not a lot there.
It doesn’t even look like a very functional desk! An entire office space that looks huge with no visible storage!!!
It looks like saw dust
Also all the white 😬 wait till there are chocolate finger prints on every surface!
I lived in Austin for a few years. There are many areas in central Texas that were popular for day trips or weekend trips. We ended up checking out tons of cool places. Waco was only 1.5 hours north of Austin but we never went there. It was never recommended to us by anyone.
I grew up in DFW but have lived in SoCal. What Cali city to compare it to? Hmmm IDK. Waco is smaller and feels like a drive thru city between Dallas and Austin but it’s been popularized by Magnolia Market/Chip & Joanna. I personally think it’s a super small town that’s good for a weekend trip at max. Smaller towns like Santa Barbara still have WAY more going on. Maybe San Clemente but without the beauty?
I think that’s her real hair since it looks the same from when she was on the show
The whole white house aesthetic is actually really dated now so you can feel better about your house. I’m sure it has much more character than this bland house.
No! Your house probably has more character. The all-white aesthetic is not livable (unless you like cleaning 24/7).
There’s something so depressing about spending that much money on this house in a suburb of Waco Texas. Honestly I would have thought you’d get a lot more house with that kind of budget there.
Oof I live in Hawaii, that will barely get you a 3 bedroom built in 1992 out here.. shits rough.
Why would they need to ask forgiveness? They are married. You don’t have to like them but this was a stupid comment.
Don’t be so sure about that, this house is in Waco Texas and really probably out in the suburbs of Waco since it appears to be a new build with a large lot. And the decor can’t be that much because there’s only like 4 items.
Give yourself more credit than that. This is a spec home in a very low cost of living area decorated with mass produced furnishings.
That, and they’re cute together.
*That’s* who he reminds me of!!!
His dad is a billionaire
Family $$$
It's not my aesthetic, but I'm more just surprised that this is the work an actual interior designer did. It's just very generic.
I think a lot of people don’t really see McMansions as “beautiful” and viscerally dislike the beige-on-beige-on-beige aesthetic / lack of color. BUT congrats to them — I’m sure it’s exactly what they wanted! They’d probably hate living in my house which is historic and whimsical! And that’s totally fine.
It's not well designed though?
Lots of haters!
This! I’m not wealthy but my house looks similar. Simply because my sense of style is not good enough. It would look ridiculous, I can’t recreate those super vibrant homes. So using basic colors is just easier :(
Same, and I couldn't figure out how to Google it without knowing how it's spelled.  My husband labeled a box in our basement as "chochkies" and I'm okay with that 😂
Same. I decorate my house like this (but not like this lol) because I’m not a billionaire. Idk if you guys know who Becca Tobin is but her home is so beautiful and while still minimalistic there are cool pieces of furniture and artwork. They made the space their own and had a lot of custom work done and pieces made. And she’s not as rich as these two!
Everything is SO boring about this decor...no character at all!
My mom has said, and I think it's completely true, that some people have bad taste, very few people have good taste, and the majority of people have no taste at all.  This is how you decorate your house when you have no personal taste. It's not offensive or garish, the pieces look cohesive, and most people would think "pretty home" if they saw it. It looks like a model showroom, which is designed to be generally aesthetically pleasing to the largest pool of people. In order to put together a more unique look, you need SOME sort of personal taste to convey to the designer. Otherwise they're not going to take risks picking out statement pieces. They're going to go with safe items that anyone without a strong opinion will probably like.
At the least, how about some art that isn’t cheesy inspirational bullshit?
Yeah the desk and entryway table were cb2
Haha so true! My husband is a realtor for a builder that makes million dollar homes and they are all so sterile to us. They are nice but not comfy or cozy like houses should be.
I feel like mainstream rich people have homes with no color, but the trendy rich people have tons of dark colors these days (a la Selling Sunset/anything Tarek or Christina on HGTV do). So many black kitchens.
Just wait for the fancy ice reveal.
A few hair extensions clogging the sink.
![gif](giphy|H4c8l1YCVSGjolbssu)
💀
It looks like the homes in the show fixer upper after chip and Johanna Gaines renovate and redecorate them. The same neutral look, however I think I prefer the fixer upper look because it’s usually a bit more homey. Something about their home makes me think doctor’s office waiting room/museum.
It’s very new money rich, not old money.
Yes!! Especially the fuckin fashion books that these sterile “wealthy” homes have to replace actual books. Like “I exude style if I have a Chanel book in my living room.”
Very true
Same here! We worked hard for ours and have put a lot of work in to improving it too.
All I can think about seeing the black decor is all the dusting. 😩   My life goal is never to live in a home that requires more than one outlet change when I'm vacuuming. Any bigger is probably too much for me to manage. 😄
Her house tour is amazing! That house is gorgeous. I love watching Architectural Digest tours  I love her green kitchen. I haven’t seen too many green kitchens but I love it
Except…she’s turning conservative homestead housewife by the day so her hippie style is more nausea inducing
Demi as well!! I think her page is so cute

If that’s true, I’m less jealous now ha. My house may be small but it’s at least got my name on the deed. And I worked my ass off for it.
But if it is in his name and he got it after getting married then it is communally owned by the both of them. Texas is a community property state so everything acquired during marriage is owned by both parties.
Are property records more trustworthy than "tea from the snark sub"? Lol
It was a joke, because the stylist (and I’m guessing Madi) decided to highlight and feature a Tom Ford and Chanel books as the only books on the bookshelf. I could not care less what either of those people actually think.
Yeah the way she looks down and prays with her hands up she does it the same weird way all the time it’s very showy
That’s kinda mean to khakis. They serve an actual purpose and have a useful existence.
Fellow Grand Rapids person checking in!
Nobody becomes a billionaire while being ambivalent about money.
I am dying at both of these retorts. lol So appropriate
Yeah it’s not full on cheugy, the “made for this moment” light feature made me feel those vibes a bit
You’re right. This is unsurprising. It matches their wedding palette. 😂
Seriously, they way they were getting excited I was like, is it a man cave? No, just more beige?
Not even a nice framed picture from their wedding… any one of those photo walls would have been perfect.  Fuck, a live laugh love sign would spice this place up
Jesus freak here. I love me some vibrant colors and patterns! 😉
I had an older sibling that went to Baylor. There was nothing to do when we visited except eat at the Olive Garden and go to Target.
Prosperity Gospel. It’s very much a thing. They are rich because God loves them the most.   Barf.
I love AD!! Haven’t checked that video out though  Edit: but i more meant rich people who don’t use an interior designed lol
I should send them a formal letter of apology! It’s more like HomeGoods but BLANDER.
[removed]
As a Texan who lived in Waco after college - it has a lot of things to do. Hiking downtown, not an insanely big city or long commute. Food is pretty alright! We really enjoyed it - and we’re not in the same world as this couple lol.
Right?! And there’s like no fkin way they will be able to maintain this if they ever get pets or have kids
Are you implying that fucking on every surface of the house when you're not married isn't okay?
I’m curious what they told them they wanted… must not have been very substantial (shocker)
Lmao y’all are wild. It’s a beautiful home.
That’s literally exactly how I’ve been spelling it 😂😂
This is so cute
Haha same I do a lot of similar stuff (but not the same) because I’m not great at design and am never sure how to use accent pieces or get things to mesh well. I’d like to imagine if I had someone designing for me, it’d be more interesting!
>Becca Tobin  I just looked and her home is so gorgeous! Someone else who does this super well is [Edie Campbell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNbhExKfqtA); her home is my dream
Definitely like the neon word lights are so overdone
All the new builds in my county are so fucking boring and sterile. I love the older homes because they have so much character.
Omg I figured it was a bachelor snark page not one dedicated solely to this girllllllll 😂 I feel behind
Same same   The entirety of this 1500 ish sq ft is mine. Well half mind ig lol
Madi thought she hit the jackpot. She’s gonna be in for a rude awakening
I think dad bought it for grant before marriage   However if the law is like in my province, Madi should still be entitled to 1/2 the appreciation from marriage until time of divorce (if that happens). So like in 10 years if the house appreciates 400,000 she gets 200 kinda thing
Not if Trizzy signed a prenup, which he most likely did. If he did then Madi won’t be listed on the deed automatically
Nice it’s just a stereotype I have based on Christian YouTubers lol
I would drive back to college or home every weekend because it was just so bad lol you couldn’t pay me to live there 😩
Wow I think I’ve heard of this before but blocked it out. How horrifying to read or hear about young children living in poverty or a war torn country or sick with a debilitating disease and think to yourself “God loves me more!” While sipping Chardonnay on your white couch.
I think I just seriously threw up in my mouth
I’m being facetious lol, he looks like a cartoon character 😂
Totally fair. I will ride or die for College Station for the same reasons you listed, but most people would also say that’s a small town with fuck all to do 😂
Legit it's a big white sterile box. That's cool if you find it nice, but don't act like everyone else is wrong.
As far as I know prenups only cover prior to marriage. If this house was acquired after getting married the prenup has no effect on it. In Texas it should be jointly owned by both.   Now, if it was bought with cash he solely owned prior to marriage, and that cash was specifically noted in a prenup, then he might be able to separately own it.
Hahaha I’m an Aggie and I totally agree! Except cstat has too many student drivers 😂 at least in Waco you can completely avoid Baylor 🤣
Ditto I could say the same to you
The tea said that Grants father purchased the Waco house for them before they were married
2?!??!?? Didn’t I just watch her & Chris get married on Paradise?? I know that’s not his kid before y’all start😂
2 years??? why does time fly so fast when it’s somebody else’s life?  i feel like i just found out she was pregnant yesterday  meanwhile my own kid just turned 2 and i don’t even remember what life before him was like, it feels like a lifetime ago
Her twin
Oh wow, she is VERY cute. Krystal hasn't aged a day since Arie's season.
SHES ALREADY 2?!!!
How has it been 2 years already!?
omg glitterbaby is 2 and she's so cute
Motherhood seems to really suit Krystal.  She looks radiant in all of those photos!
She looks like Krystal.
I feel like I just saw her birth announcement on this sub like the other day how is her child two already??
I’ll always be rooting for Krystal. Also her workout videos got me into great shape a few years ago! Her voice still annoys the shit out of me after a while and I sometimes think her ideas are a little whack but I still love her lol
She is her clone!!! How cute
Omg!! What a cutie
She is one the cutest kids I've ever seen. Some photos she looks like a Krystal mini-me and in others more like a Miles mini-me version.
She was the tiniest pretty little baby and I can’t believe she’s already two!
Can’t believe she is 2 already 😍
God really said CTRL+C —> CTRL+V
Omg she is so cute!!
Oh shit, I forgot she had a baby! Congrats to her and happy bday to that sweet girl 😍
She looks exactly like her mama!
I’m not even a baby person but this is one of the cutest kids I have ever seen!
She is such a cutie!!!
What a cutie!
She’s flipping adorable!
Beautiful!  They have the same smile!  Daughter’s so cute!!
This brings me back to her giving birth on my due date early (i think?) and me being pissed because i was still pregnant LOL
Someone help me find these pjs for my two year old!!!
Wow, I did not recognize her with the thicker brows and darker blond hair.
Aw my little girl just turned 2 too. Such a fun time. 🥰🥰 Happy birthday glitter baby!
I missed a chapter
Thank God! I wouldn’t want him cutting her bangs off at the hairline.
I thought that too lol
Have you seen the dad? They all look the same!
She seems so so so so happy
Have you seen her dad? Twins!!
PJs are from Carters! Breakfast Fleece Footie PJs.
I have and I still think she’s her twin 😂
I don’t know if I have! But based on how much she looks like her mom, I am guessing Krystal and the father look like siblings lol
You’re a gem ☺️
Haha cute I see her dad more but like I said triplets!
Kl
![gif](giphy|IcdPUZfFDG9fcpmfp0|downsized)  Happy birthday 🥂🥂
She looks exactly like a younger Hannah Waddignham
the blurred out cigar, slayful
She was a gem. Totally overshadowed by the chaos of her season, glad to see she's thriving
Giving Robin from HIMYM
I still have a crush on her idc
She looks amazing! Our champagne queen 👸🏼
Should've had champagne.
Met her IRL a couple years ago, and she was lovely
as she should
The only person on her season that made sense as a contestant
I miss seeing Kelsey tbh
tbh i think she would have been a pretty good bachelorette actually
Greg Grippo hehehe
She looks great!!! Happy she’s happy and thriving 😍❤️
She’s so stunning. Top 5 most beautiful people on the show in my opinion
i was always sad she wasnt the bachelorette after peter’s season, honestly. i felt like she could laugh at herself and was pretty down to earth. also drop dead gorgeous and knows what a crab rangoon is
Stunning! She would bring me back to watching the show, in all honesty.
Hello Bridget Bardot
Ya it’s really sweet to make jokes at the expense of disabled people 😐
*The only person*  *On her season that made sense*  *As a contestant*  \- kurnty  ---  ^(I detect haikus. And sometimes, successfully.) ^[Learn&#32;more&#32;about&#32;me.](https://www.reddit.com/r/haikusbot/)  ^(Opt out of replies: "haikusbot opt out" | Delete my comment: "haikusbot delete")
I think Kelsey was on TPTB’s shortlist, but by the end of PP’s season everyone was so fed up with his cast of women that they probably didn’t want to take a chance on her. Every Bachelorette past and present has been a fan favorite and she didn’t have that big of fan base. Plus not to mention the fact that Kelsey didn’t play ball during HTD when she refused to have her father be a part of it. Obviously, I’m glad that she put her foot down on that for the sake of her mental health (considering their strained relationship). But I’m guessing that was a strike in TPTB’s eyes since she wasn’t easily manipulated.
I genuinely don’t remember this happening, what did she do?
Guys I'm obsessed with Marshall. If I fell in love with someone blind and they ended up looking like THAT I would be so happy. He reminds me of Jesse Williams

Ugh i love them both
Do you think Justin will be at the wedding 💀
I HOPE justin is at the wedding
Does he have problematic tweets like Justin?
For real! He’s so handsome. Beautiful eyes and smile. And his personality makes him 200x more attractive. Jackie doesn’t know what she’s got.
Right!? When Jackie said he’s not her type I was shocked. He’s so handsome.
I want it so bad now 😭😭
Well I’m not sure since I think this probably filmed a similar time to bachelor in paradise. I heard it was filmed in June of 2022. Not sure how accurate that is though
he’s handsome and kind and can cook?!? i’m the kind of person where personality adds so much to someone’s attractiveness so he would be a ten to me 🥹
Idk if this is the interview, but Ashley did actually mention recently on her other podcast, IDGI, that she had a really bad interview where she was off her game and just kept spacing out on what questions to ask and how to respond.
I didn’t listen to this episode but usually Ashley I comes across like the aunt you’re not at all close with but who tactlessly pries into your personal life at family functions.
I can’t listen to Almost Famous because Ashley’s interviewing is so annoying to me (and there are way too many commercials lol)
I think Ashley is one of those people who thinks she is cooler than all other BN people kind of like Nick V, wells and others. She is pretty negative about most new relationships
I listened and felt like Serene was just very reserved and dull😬 I thought Ashley was doing a good job trying to encourage the conversation/relate/ask questions and Serene was just giving nothing!
Can you give an example of how she was trying to get negative responses? I’m sure she read about the rumors when Serene was back in Oklahoma about something being up with them.
 Ashley seems like that in every clip I see of her from that podcast lol so tactless and negative
Ashley I has mentioned being tired and overwhelmed as a mom. She has broken down on the podcast previously. I know she has said problematic things on that podcast years ago but I’m more willing to believe that she’s going through a rough time as a mom and she doesn’t sound like her usual podcast host self. Something is off for sure. Hope she gets better.
There’s been 2 episodes that Caelynn was on with Rachel R and Michelle as well. However, when talking about rings in both interviews Ashley I mentioned multiple times about caelynns ring not being a real diamond and something along the lines about if she would’ve known about them (but I don’t think her nor Jared even paid for her ring?) also on both episodes I believe either Michelle or Rachel would follow up saying how beautiful caelynns ring is. I’m not sure if I’m misremembering, but I remember listening to both interviews and finding it odd that it seemed like she had to point it out about the ring.   Also agree with someone’s comment about that there’s way too many commercials. An episode will be 30 minutes long and half of it is commercials lol😂
I’ll forever find anyone questionable who listens to Ashley I and who goes on that podcast. I’ll never forgive her for her I’m not rac**t because I have black friends moment so bless Serene for giving her the time of day but I need her to make better choices before she starts using her for why she couldn’t be rac**t 🤣
or maybe she heard things about serene and Brandon or felt serene wasn't being sincere. I'm no Ashley I fan but what does serene have for her to be jealous of? I personally find serene hard to read and think she's just going along to get along and doesn't share her true feelings. Maybe Ashley could sense the same.
Didn’t Jared share that Brandon called him out on being shady for making a move on Ashley when she was still in a relationship with Kevin? Jared didn’t mind but maybe Ashley did and is why she’s weird with Serene
I bet this was it!
True of all iHeart podcasts. It’s entirely too many ads of other podcasts.
The year was 2020 when I found myself in the pandemic fuming bc of Ben’s self righteousness and Ashley’s annoying manner of interviewing people. And I thought, “oh, I don’t have to listen to them” and never looked back. I would for an old lead or something like that but nothing’s really seemed that great so I unsubscribed and I don’t feel that way anymore more😚
Yes! She thinks she’s cooler but she’s the person who graduated high school but keeps visiting.
I mean to be fair Wells married Sarah Hyland so he is cooler than any of us ever will be.
Interesting!
Like on both shows? Lol but tbh I see some life in her when she’s with her old friends. I can’t see her as a long term BN person. I don’t think that world is doing it for her and I know she’s stressed trying to pay them bills
She’d ask questions about how things were going and insinuate things must be hard etc and then Serene would give a positive response and Ashley would give very meh reactions in response. I don’t remember exact quotes but could dig some up if you want lol
Hope so too.
Jeez. I wasn’t aware of that. Awful. I never listen to this podcast anymore but I turned it on for some background noise while cleaning today and found it very meh.
When did she say that? I know barely anytjing about Ashley I but she rubs me the wrong way from what little I know of her.
Ashley seemed to be having a tough time (understandably) adjusting to motherhood and maybe seeing a couple in a seemingly honeymoon phase would be tough? Who knows! Just speculating and found the interview uncomfortable to listen to. Their energies weren’t matching.
The moment when you realize you don’t have to listen to a podcast you don’t enjoy is when your life truly begins!
IMO all that did for me was make Sarah Hyland less cool. It didn’t elevate Wells in my book 🤣
Maybe Ashley knows something is up and is fishing, getting discouraged at the positive replies thinking it’s a deflection. Everyone has off days though and she could be going through some things.   Edit: spelling
Gotcha! You don’t have to dig further lol
A few years ago when she got attacked for her comments on Mike Johnson. When the comments got too much she said how can I be rac**t I’m friends with Rachel and Tayshia 😒 And Mike also confronted her about her hate for him and she apologized for her comments but never for that disgusting comment that she made
Idk Brandon has been open about his mental struggles so maybe if serene was just being all positive Ashley thought she was giving PR responses
🙌
What's that line from "The Good Place"? Something like:  "She was pretty enough to go on the Bachelor, but smart enough not to"  😂😂😂
Hell no. This sub would fucking eat me alive. 🤣
Yes. My mom passed away when I was a kid and I’ve dated some real shit bags, so I could whip out the ultimate sob story to win over the lead. I’ve also lived with an astronomical amount of roommates in my life, so I can ignore drama and fighting like no one else. Even the possibility of being an influencer would be enough for me.
Absolutely not. I take criticism terribly and am extremely sensitive. My mental health would never allow it.
I’d be flattered, but they fuck people’s shit up
Hell no. I wouldn’t sign up to potentially be taken advantage of and misrepresented all while getting a max of like 2K Instagram followers. In the past, I definitely would’ve considered it though.
For funzies? God yes. I wanna travel and make a bunch of new besties. For a loving relationship with a quality man built on mutual respect and trust? Hahahahahahahahhahahahahahaha
Would I do it? Yes. Should I do it ? Dear god no, it would destroy my mental health if I actually got screentime
No way, I’m a private person who wants nothing to do with the public eye, and every little stupid thing I said or did would keep me awake at night for the rest of my life. 🤦🏼‍♀️
Hell yeah I would. The show lacks South Asian representation so I'm going.  I got an entire plan laid out to have fun with it. My occupation would be "future astronaut". I would still drama over innocuous things like the fact someone likes cool ranch doritos more than nacho cheese. I'd tell the lead they were here for the wrong reasons and shoutout reddit.  &#x200B;  I'm "only" 5'9\~5'10, but I got a plan where I'll just come out in a pair of stilts, so I'll be 7'6 instead.
Yes. And I would even go so far as to say that they need me. I apply every 3 months. I would be the greatest villain of all time, I am naturally extremely off-putting, emotionally unintelligent, and a shit stirrer to my core. I would sell myself, my morals, and my community down the river immediately for that sweet, sweet fifteen minutes. And I do not care for men but they are so easy to manipulate. BACHELOR CASTING IF YOU'RE LISTENING I'M CLAY FOR YOU TO MOLD
I magically become hot? Sign me up lol
I’d go for the free trips but I don’t think my career look favourably on it. If you have a business or are real estate agent, hair stylist, personal trainer, etc it could really benefit your career though
No way, I am way too sensitive. The hate comments would eat me alive.
Yes plus I’m 30. I’d get 6th place in Bachelorette, join BIP in week 2 and then break up before or in the finale.  Instagram and Reddit comments don’t bother me haha.  The downside for me is I’d be SWEATING in the suits/long sleeves.  I’d get a solid 16k followers (up from my 426 followers), but I post twice a year roughly, and my stories are basically @trashcanpaul stories and video game/TV/movie reviews.
I would die of embarrassment if I was on this show. I am honestly in awe of confident people
Nope. Because honestly, I find the fan base to be extra harsh on men of color like me.   Sure, all I need to do is smile and occasionally kiss the lead to get the “u/kinggeedra for Bachelor” train going. But don’t show that you’re too attracted because fans will say you’re love-bombing her or corny. Don’t be too flirty with her, because fans will think you’re just a f-boy. If the lead’s white, that apparently means I have a clear preference for white women. It’ll even be worse if I got to BIP. “Hey, why isn’t u/kinggeedra not with her? They’re the same race! He’s self-hating and/or clearly prefers white women”.  Just a lot of ways for folks to get the wrong assumptions about me, and then be able to post them en masse in public forums. My mind wouldn’t be able to handle it.
Literally shocked by this response 😂 Y'all really want the trauma???
Nope. I don’t know how to do my own hair and make up and I wouldn’t be able to afford the clothes I’d need. Also way too sensitive! And I don’t have Instagram so no benefit to me there.  On the flip side I would love the friendships and traveling and I can absolutely fall in love that quickly.  But still no.
Definitely not. I have anxiety and would be having panic attacks lol
Ariel is absolutely right that you’re signing up to be in a temporary open relationship, and I have absolutely no interest in an open relationship.
Would’ve gone 3-5 years ago when contestants gained loads of followers but I surely wouldn’t go in 2023/2024 lol
I am a straight shooter and I can just SEE myself being edited as a villain lol so it’s a no from me
I’d be tempted for a few minutes.  Then reality would remind me that I would hate that environment.  Plus, I’d be terrified of the manipulation and the edit.
Hmmm go on a show to be tortured by production and then by strangers on the internet for the chance at “love” and money in social media sponsorships? No thanks
Everything about this show sounds physically and emotionally exhausting. Plus, with social media today, you're basically signing yourself up to get harassed.
I love how we are all like…dumb, air headed, lazy people only go on this show. Then Half of us say we would go on this show 😂 I’m sure 90% of contestants are completely normal people who got a cool opportunity
Absolutely not, I wouldn't even think about it.   Producers who's job is literally to manipulate and lie to you to get the best entertainment, editors who's job is potentially to show you in the worst possible way on purpose, even stringing together words to make it sound like you've said certain things. Audience/people online who will dig through your personal life and mistakes and make sure as much as the world knows it as possible, your every word being scrutinzed. Getting hateful messages and threats. A show where you're supposed to be happy to get a plant from a random dude every week, because it means you get to get engaged to him in the end after knowing him for a few weeks.. and this guy is just known for having been on the previous season of the show and getting far in it, that's it. That's the reason he's the lead, and why they're pitching him as impressive.  Uh no thanks.   (I wouldn't want to be an influencer either though, and I don't need that kind of "wealth")
Wow, I am genuinely shocked at the voting split so far, specifically that so many people would go! #Shocked.
So many people willing to fuck up their sanity for this shit?!
No. I’m a hater and I’d get so much karma back
I turn 24 this year and I just wanna know when do I *grow up* and look like them? I’m 5’3 105lb blonde but damn I look average as fuck compared to them and like I’m 12
Depends on who the Bachelor is and how boring my life is at the moment.
Couldn’t do it!  1. My family & friends would judge me in a bad way, and I’d be too embarrassed.  2. It seems so stressful!  3. I couldn’t afford to not work when I was right out of college.  4. I think it would negatively impact my career.  5. I suck at doing makeup.
Depends on how my career was doing
Depends on if my mom says it’s ok because it’s a school night
It depends on if you’re a likable person. If you go on the show and become a fan favorite, you can easily become a millionaire in 3-4 years from podcasts, endorsements, pay from the show, etc.
No lmao. Being hot and single doesn’t change the fact that I’m an anti social potato. Like I’ll watch the drama, but I’m not about to be all up in the drama for some man who has 15 other girls saliva on his mouth 🫣
I'd rather die than go through the criticism that these people go through, from strangers who think they know them through a few hours of highly edited TV
Honestly, when I was that age, I was smoking hot and super confident. However, I was a size 10.. and therefore, I'd have the words "plus-sized" under my name every time I appeared on screen. Also, no lead would ever have chosen me because I wasn't a size zero, and I'm 5'10". I'd still go in the show, but I'd not have any expectation of finding love. I'd just go for the experience.
If it wasn’t televised, sure why not. But I do not want to be in the public eye lol
Hell yeah I would’ve in my 20s. Love a good life experience but honestly I was prob not emotionally stable enough in my 20s to deal with all of that lol
Absolutely not. They can edit you in any defamatory and outright dishonest way that they want to. Way too big a risk.
if i was hot and single i would go on love island UK tbh. so many hot men and less stress. even if i end up getting dumped from the villa at least i got a free vacation and a nice tan out of it.   I wouldn’t personally subject myself to bach producer’s torture.
I'm transgender, disabled and otherwise absolutely not the right person for this show in any shape or form, but if an alternate universe gender normative, conventionally attractive version of me was accepted on the show I would go for the experience, and also possibly to troll them. At most, I'd aim for a Paradise run, but I wouldn't be interested in lasting long and I would not be emotionally invested in anything that happened
As long as you know you’re someone to shy away from drama then I think you should go on the show. You’ll probably make it a couple weeks and go home with a cool experience and people to hang out with around the country for a year or so
No way. Being locked up in a house constantly surrounded by people for that long would make me crazy.
I’d go ONLY if I got to smoke as much weed as my heart desires. Cuz I’m gonna need it
Hell yes! I'd craft the perfect story of trauma and empowerment, viewers would have no choice but to follow me on social media and buy all the cheap fashion, wine, and knickknacks I'll be peddling.
Yes, I think it'd be funny and would simply self-eliminate before hometowns so my family can't do anything crazy on national television
Considering I once filled out an app to be on the bachelorette (didn’t submit it), I would. I’d definitely scrub my social media first though. Or even just deactivate it all lol.
There was a time that I would go on this show but I think it’s passed. I wouldn’t be able to go back to my corporate job after so I’d rly need to be confident that I could make something of my time on the show
No, but I would probably hold out for a show like MAFS or Love is Blind.
The answer is an easy yes. Make new friends, get exposure and possibly find someone. Go one have fun, come out and make a little more sending people birthday wishes for $55 a pop.
I couldn't handle the emotional trauma but I'd give anything to be a fly on the wall in some of those scenes.
hell ya! but i’d probably get eliminated during the second rose ceremony, if not night 1 🙃
I absolutely would just to get on Paradise.
I would go but I’d avoid Reddit afterwards 😂
It depends 2 other things. A.) is my life going well? B.) Did I gain media savvy when I suddenly became single and hot enough for the show? Cause I need the first to be a no and the second to be a yes for the risk to be worth it.
I would go, shoutout this sub as my entrance quirk, and then air out anything remotely problematic I've done in my first private interview and just hope for the best
My current mind back in my 20-something year old body? No way. I’ve got enough self awareness now to know that I couldn’t handle it, and I’ve been to enough therapy that the producers wouldn’t have a great time with me. I also have no desire to give my exes and estranged family members an excuse to shit talk me to the world.   Me 10-15 years ago? Yeah, I would have. I would have been a producer’s wet dream. Trauma dump dates? Oh yeah, pick which direction you want me to go because I’ve got a MOUNTAIN. Easily manipulated due to low self esteem, a need for validation, and untreated mental illness? Absolutely.
I’m gay, but life is short. Maybe I can have a plot point where I seduce another contestant
Until I realized that there are actual contracts and money involved, my answer would have been no. But the truth is, this hot piece of airborne garbage has launched many a career. It’s “an opportunity.” I think it’s shallow and stupid, but I also think if you’re looking for a shallow and empty career, this dumb show could potentially be helpful. 🤷‍♀️
ONLY, and ONLY if I could actually see myself with the lead. Like Peter or another funny high-energy personality
I'm not good at faking enthusiasm, I would surely get cut on night 1
The followers aren't worth it I would just go onto to Hot to Handle or Love Island if this was the case
I would be considered “big” compared to the other girls, size 12 lol, which is not big but yk, big for ABC, and i have ass and thighs soooo idk if i would like getting bullied 😭  I would be the token “bigger” girl
Because of my career, I wouldn’t. I don’t think I could ever go back after appearing on this show and the influencer bubble will pop some day
I don't think I could kiss people I wasn't interested in.
The way you would talk about POC contestants…hmmm. I don’t know.
If I was young and hot I would go after local guys (that were actual catches) instead of creating a long distance problem for myself for someone that is a total wildcard.  It'd only be fun to be the lead, but that looks stressful as hell because of all the behind the scenes stuff. They always put some right wing racists or misogynists in the mix and that doesn't sound like a good time, either.
I'd go on to start/be a part of goofy drama and peace out before hometowns.
Morbid curiosity makes me say yes, even tho I’m borderline hate-watching each new season lmao. I just wanna see for myself how the sausage is made!
Def no LOL. I do not want to be famous and invite thousands of strangers to misjudge me. Although I do wish I was hot tho LOLLL oh well. 🤣
I’m too sensitive and too fat lmao
I’m way too shy and too nice for this show. I could do reality tv now, but definitely couldn’t in my 20s. I didn’t have the confidence or the balls that I do now in my 40s. A reality show for cougars? I could do that. 😆
I think I would try just to try (I’d definitely get sent home night 1) but I would just to see how long I could last.   No one tell my current boyfriend 😅😂
It’s hard to imagine myself in that situation but no. There isn’t the opportunity for Instagram fortune anymore, but there’s still a huge chance I lose my job for any mistake I make
I’d have to say no because I could not handle hearing what the general public had to say about me. Even if 99% of the comments were nice, one person saying I was ugly or something would stick with me, so I’d rather not know!
Depends on if it’s a gay version lmao
I would go only if I can game plan it all with this sub. Undercover contestant 🫡
I'm a therapist so I have to say no (really wouldn't want patients to learn details of my personal life), but probably if I had a different kind of job!
i would if i was one of those contenstants who get to the middle of the season without any screentime lol so i could just make friends with the other girls and get to travel haha
Absolutely not. Not gonna take the time off work, not gonna take the hit to my reputation, not gonna waste a significant amount of time just for a 1 in 30 chance that the bachelor likes me, and the slimmer chance that I actually like him enough to want to marry him. No thanks.   Really the hit to my professional reputation would be the worst part. I'm an airline pilot, Pete might have survived being on the show, but it's hard enough being a woman in this industry without having to deal with reality show judgement too.
Oh yes for sure lol it would be such a crazy interesting experience!!
Hell yes, I’d cause so much drama with the other guys on purpose😂😂
Hell yes. Just for the money making opportunities, TBH. Considering that almost everyone on this show goes on to launch an “Influencer” career, I don’t think anyone is there for the “right reasons” anymore.
Definitely would depend on who the lead was for me
Can’t do it with my kind of career 🥲
Depends on job
Yes, but for all the wrong reasons.
Noooooo chance. Unless I could bring a blanket along to every date so that every time I made out with the lead I could shield us from the cameras.   My good Christian momma doesn’t need to see me tonsil deep in some dude tasting his other girlfriends’ lipgloss
If I was single, yeah probably I’d accept provided they don’t take away my medications or mess with that. I don’t remember what contestant it was but I remember reading on here how they withheld a contestants prescription medications from her to get her to act out more on camera
I’m not sure, do you think the show runners are looking for 6 ft tall straight white dudes who like country music and will start fights with just the tiniest sip of booze? In that case, yee-haw brother man, sign me up.  Edit: John 3:16 ya’ll
Only if I get to be on the first lesbian bachelorette season 😝
Mannnn I would go in a heart beat I mean what do I have to loose😭😭
I would only go on the show if the contestants were guaranteed decent people lol
Oh I'm in there for sureeee
Someone I knew with a producer hookup offered to get me on the show when I was like 28, but by that point I was too aware of the pitfalls, so I can confidently say I wouldn't unless all knowledge of the show and its impact were magically erased from my brain.
FUCK YEA
Yeah. As someone with not a lot of experience, I’d take a crash course. Luckily, already in therapy for when I get back
Might as well! Lol  But heavy on the single part. I’m hot but definitely not single lol
I met my now boyfriend (and future husband)  like a month before I turned 23 and graduated college lol. I always said I’d apply and deff go after I graduated college LOL so I deff would’ve
I'm gay, so it wouldn't work for me...
Hell no
nah, there’s too much of me on the internet lol
YES. partially bc i’d love to get to be the person who showed that a size 16 is hot as fuck on the show and partially bc i love watching drama play out irl.
Hundred percent. I don’t think I’m hot enough but if they wanted me, absolutely 😂 hopefully I’d make it to one of those cool exotic locations.
I am single and 29 and have been approached. I said no immediately, I’m already mentally unstable, I don’t need this to push me over the edge
If I could go on dancing with the stars afterwards then yes. But not a chance I’m letting myself like the guy bc I couldn’t deal with my boyfriend dating other girls. Also I could not be an influencer so if I were to have a “career” as a result of going on the show I would honestly want to do something more like Jesse. But yeah I wouldn’t be in it for the love
If my job was ok with it and my parents agreed to not disown me then I’d agree to be the ‘Ette. Why not. However I wouldn’t be a contestant under any circumstance.. ick
I went against it for liking my anonymity mostly! And also not wanting to take a break in school. I was at UPenn! I feel like being a bachelor contestant could be frowned upon in the Ivy League, haha. I’m also planning on going into academia which I know is very reputation heavy. There’s also the issue of not being interested in any of the recent bachelors.
So what is “hot”?
I don’t trust them to handle my mental illness with care 😅 they’ll have my bipolar ass lookin like I’m “crazy” and I’m far too sensitive to receive mean messages
Lmao just being viewers puts us all in the bad place according to that show hahaha
Fun fact, one of the hosts of GOR, Lizzy Pace, was a writer on the Good Place and has admitted to being the main person behind all of the Bach references in the show
lol I wouldn’t even get enough air time for the sub to realize I was on the show.
Also sharing a man with 25 other women? Hard pass
Good point, followers are dwindling now
Lolol, that would be amazing
LOL. TBTB, we know you're out there, why don't you cast u/everfoundemma? they're ratings gold!!  &#x200B;  ![gif](giphy|UVMdRcOS6M2Pt1Doyw)
Lol, I love how you have it all planned out
Man, yeah. I wouldn’t if I was a guy of color either. They have an incredibly challenging experience on the show. (And, obviously, off.)
Same!! If the poll was on Facebook, I’d get it. But Reddit??
Me Too!!
For real! We’re on this sub everyday, I’ve seen the viciousness
There have been plenty of petite girls on the bachelor. I’d say a must for the show is great hair though so maybe long hair extensions and a spray tan lmao and they tend to favor girls who dress very basic
Same. If the bachelor was a stupid, shallow asshat, I would do a bad job of faking interest and get sent home night one anyway, lol.  Although that might make it easier since I’d only need to take a week off work 😄
This would be me. I stay away from drama and leave the trouble makers alone.
i think MAFS would be fun hahaha
Oh same, I just know in my heart I’d be a night one goner
This. I’d be taking an immense step back in my career and I’d rather just travel the world on my own time (and dime) rather than risking my career
Check out “MILF Manor”.  It was so horribly fantastic. Barf.
I’ve had more than one weird stress dream where I’m a contestant on the bachelor. In the dreams, I always get sent home night 1.
Does she watch The Bachelor/ette?
that was season 1 of unreal, as far as i can remember.
Ooh you would fit right in
your dignity!!! the producers love to edit
id go to Facebook and be like who can donate me pretty dresses for the rose ceremony
More negative points because we’ve posted about it here, too. That’s OK, we’ll get used to the butthole spiders, and eventually, they get bored.
YUP! I'm in the Pit. Heeeey! *waves*
Or, you’d be F1.
Yeah that’s my point like on paper I meet the criteria but then I don’t look like I get blowouts and professional makeup done every day. My wardrobe definitely isn’t from revolve. I wasn’t a beauty Queen growing up lol
Back in the Groove was a cute foil to MILF Manor!
Lol that’s so rough. I feel for those people. Also I apparently am really bad at picking bc often my favorites from appearance alone go home without even being spoken to.
It used to be family tradition for my mom, dad, and me to watch it every week while making fun of every little detail of the show.... so I KNOW they’d be watching my season and they would cut me no slack   and hometowns would be a lot like if every member of my family was Ariel’s brother and/or Tayshia’s dad
oh I see, I just strongly remember someone saying that about paradise (similar to how Tahzjuan wasn’t allowed to poop when she needed to)  but I could be totally wrong.  I haven’t seen unreal yet.
Lmaooo I just feel like I’m not overly dramatic or crazy so I feel like I could beat the producers & there editing skills😂
![gif](giphy|pD7YIQoUwgb9cnX3FJ|downsized)
Same girl lol this franchise definitely has a “type” when it comes to the women they usually pick I feel like. I don’t know if it’s genes or what but I wasn’t blessed with it 🤣
Thought you could hide, nvm. But, she doesn't seem that Christian, if she's okay with watching other people. Maybe you'll be okay?
oh, they definitely withhold in several ways that are horrible — food and bathroom, primarily. but i’ve read a lot of BTS and never heard anything like that because of the liability, but remember the electric s1 of unreal with my entire body.
Don’t forget that PP almost legitimately left his season to get back with HB. Excellent television
Going from Hannah’s season straight to Peter’s season was pure chaos and peak entertainment. An era of the show I will never forget. I feel blessed to have watched history unfold in real time ❤️
I feel like Hannah’s was the most dramatic season but Peter’s was the most dramatic if you count the things that happened after lol, it was the gift that kept on giving
![gif](giphy|QxpuLrBue48h0pbhOC)  There’s only one answer that makes sense here 😂
Barb carries PP’s entire season. I will never forget her ATFR moment.
Nothing has had my jaw on the ground like PP’s finale and ATFR
For me it’s between Hannah and PP  ![gif](giphy|ckeuedCg9rs6D64CLw|downsized)
I’m shocked no one has mentioned Claire. Might be disqualified for not being a full season, but that was only because she was so dramatic that they needed to kick her off her own show.
I think as a whole PP, however I will say Clayton telling both women he loves and slept with them at a rose ceremony by itself I think was one of the most dramatic and shocking things I’ve seen on this show lmfao. Also overall as a longtime watcher I have to say Jason - his was the original “‘most dramatic”
I’ll never get over Clayton telling gabby and Rachel he had sex with both of them  and that he loves all three lol at a freaking rose ceremony
It’s Mesnick for me. Close second was Jake Pavelka being exposed as a villain during ATFR. I could NOT believe what I was watching! He’s such a POS for how he treated Vienna.
I picked PP, but it was close with Hannah B. Clayton is clear 3rd for me.   From Hannah asking him to leave (and him considering it), champagne gate, him sending alayah home and then bringing her back, Victoria F and Chase Rice, the Sydney and Tammy fight, the mykenna and Tammy 1-on-1, victorias non existent hometown, THEN Peter sleeping with the women and all the bullshit with Barb and Madi at AFTR. And then Peter sleeping with Hannah B and then dating Kelly? It’s Peter for me. His season was some of the best tv I’ve ever watched. Hannah’s season was a close 2nd, but ATFR with Peter can’t be beat for me
Peters, he chose HA for god knows why, they break up filmed SHV, PP caught in talking to BOTH hannah b and madi during engagement, (and probably kelley i cant remember lmao), dates Madi for what 2 days at atfr? Then gets with Kelley.  too many twists and turns with this man.      And, Barb. Need I say more
Where is Ben Higgins?? His double I love you walked so Clayton’s double fantasy suite confession could run!
I haven’t seen it in full, but, given the things I’ve seen from the reaction at the time, Jason mesnicks season is prob the right pick. Seems like that sort of brought the show back from fading relevancy
hannah’s fiance was in a relationship or at least seeing another girl when the show started. that’s gotta be the most dramatic. also the fall afterwards with her nearly dating tyler only for him to go on to date gigi. and luke refusing to leave when he didnt receive a rose. sorry nothing tops it.  i consider pilot pete the closest runner up because he swapped his first choice so many times.
I picked colton because he jumped over a fence and that's just super dramatic.
Mesnick’s
I mean the Luke to Jed arc is hard to beat
I can’t believe Clare’s season isn’t here or even Brad’s first season, also Jason’s.
I got so stoned watching Pilot Pete's season that my friend named her bong Barb.
Gotta give it to Jason honestly. At the time it happened when we were used to cookie cutter vanilla, that ATFR was incredible. PP wins for recent memory however.
Barb ATFR on pilot Pete’s season will always be the most dramatic shit I’ve ever seen 😂😂
Every time I see the name “Juan Pablo” I immediately hear the words “come here to me” in my head in his accent. So everyone just stop writing his name plz.
It really depends on how you define dramatic. I think the producers have done a good job of giving us some form of "dramatic" every season.    I'll add to the list Ben Flajnik' season simply because we've never had a villain make it to Final 1.
Clayton may claim dramatic final episodes but Peter and Hannah had entire chaotic dramatic seasons.
Jason’s hands down forever
the rose ceremony from hell easily puts clayton in top 5
Maybe not the whole season, but I think that Arie's final episode was as dramatic af. I was truly shocked at what went down when he met Becca at that secret house. I just couldn't believe what was unfolding on the screen, and had to re-watch it several times.  I also think the Clare - Tayshia switcheroo is as dramatic and off script as a season can get.  I only time I really believed the whole 'most dramatic season yet' schtick was with Desiree's final 3. Probably because it was my first season so I didn't know they always say that, but still think that going from sobbing on the end of the jetty over Brooks, to sending the gorgeous Drew home without doing their last date, to a super romantic date and proposal with Chris. Talk about dramatic turning around from devastation and heartbreak to happy ever after.
Jason, by a landslide.
why the jason and brad erasure
None of these: Mesnick or Brad 1.0. Iconic.
The fence jump and a bachelor running off into the night is still the most “dramatic” thing to happen, as much as I hate to give that season attention.
If we’re talking about on screen season only, Hannah B. PPete was maybe more chaotic if you include all the off screen and post season stuff.
For more recent, I would 100% agree with others that it's Pilot Pete. Him sending Alayah home, only to then walk in with her at a group date afterparty, and announce he's allowing her to come back and then proceed to give her the group date rose, will forever be one of the most hilarious moments of this show to me. Plus Hannah B's appearance, everything with VF (Chase Rice, the guy we just saw?!), his break-up with Hannah Ann at the safe house, his two day reconciliation with Madi, I could go on and on. His mom was also TV gold. The audience was literally booing her at the finale!  The producers really dropped the ball by not meeting his salary demands for paradise. What could have been...
Peter's season felt like a spin-off of Hannah's that even included guest appearances by her. I can't vote for one over the other because in my mind they are a weird package deal lol
I picked Hannah bc the drama lasted all season with Luke P’s toxicity, but the drama really peaked at the end for every other season (or after if you’re PP)
Barb's season
I voted Colton, fence jump was exhilirating and they knew it which is why they teased it all season long.
I voted for Colton because of where we are today.
Claire
Definitely pilot Pete! That season was a train wreck lol
Ben Flajnik
Arie walked so Peter, Hannah, C*lton, Clayton, could RUN. He set off a chain reaction of lawlessness in the franchise so I gave it to him
Hannah’s season wasn’t too dramatic until the end. she kept Luke entirely too long, until we got to fantasy suites her season was mostly just frustrating. It was a lot of “when is she going to send him home.”  Peter’s season was non stop drama from the start. With Hannah’s reappearance, Chase Rice, and reenactment of Peter’s golf cart injury. The list goes on   And I will never forgot how Peter teased the season saying even he didn’t know how it was going to end. Which I fully believe 😂
  Clare/Tayshia’s season!! They literally had to change leads part way though
Peters season was like lame mean girl drama primarily. Hannah’s fantasy suite week and beyond is PEAK bach drama! Great tv!
I picked Colton because fence jump, becoming a stalker (boo) and then turning out he was gay the whole time is pretty dramatic
i chose colton cause that fence jump paired with production not being able to find him was truly smth we had not seen before and i doubt we will see it again   everything else is variations of the same kinds of drama but to different extremes  edit: i said the wrong fucking name… stupid white boy names all sounding the same
Hannah B’s season was the most dramatic. Peter’s was just messy.
Jason's season and then of course Brad womack's first season.
I thought Juan Pablo was messy AF lmao
I loved pilot Pete’s season 😂 Idc what anyone says. It was so entertaining & like others have said, it continued for so long after with Maddie & Kelley. PLUS, I think since RS didn’t spoil it until the very end it kept it interesting with all the drama behind that
Poll seems to be most dramatic in recent bachelor history only, because Jake P. (because he was awful!) Chris Soules, Desiree should all be on this list. The two on ones in those seasons were classics.
Chris Soules for fun factor
TBH, PP then Matt then Clayton, back to back were all very dramatic for completely different reasons including stuff happening off screen.
Are we forgetting Rachel Lindsay's dramatic breakup with Peter? That was probably the most intense breakup scene we've seen. The emotions were all over the place with passion, sadness, frustration and more.
Voted Pete but it’s a hard pick between him and Hannah
I might’ve said PP if they hadn’t rushed the Maddy ending so much. Meanwhile, on Arie’s season, they gave us an excruciatingly long ending. Like, the most painful and dramatic thing I’ve ever watched
Hands down Jason Mesnick
I’m sorta surprised more people didn’t say Arie other than his dramatics was after the show was over but still.
Clayton and Pilot Pete for sure. Both had not only explosive endings, but lots of inter contestant drama throughout the season too.   Juan Pablo is my favorite season to watch of these though.
I just love Clayton's favorite phrase!
Jason Mesnick, Kaitlyn, PP, Arie, and Hannah Brown
Hannah’s is the most dramatic overall, throughout the season - Luke staying around had America *rattled*. And then the ending with Jed.   Pilot Pete was petty drama, low stakes, so I guess if you want the most petty drama, he wins.  Mesnick had the most shocking ending by far. Nothing like that had ever happened and it completely changed the franchise. Arie is a runner up for a shocking ending, it had happened before by that point but he was very callous about it unlike Mesnick which was shocking.  Colton had the most dramatic tease moment, everybody was tuning in to see what the fence jump was about.
Picking Pete over Clayton is INSANE - his women were the WORST to each other but the story line was not crazy aaaat aaall. Clayton gave us cat fights and an incomparable last 3 episodes
I know we know now that Colton is not a good guy but the fence jump…
Desiree got left, and RS was wrong —-
out of these picks i went with pete, but i’d say ben f’s season!!
Clayton hands down. The last few episodes were such a damn mess, it couldn’t be topped. Next would be Jason’s, that was some shit boi. I wanted to jump through the screen and shake him. Hannah’s season was ACTUAL non stop drama. Luke p, luke s, Garrett, etc. “stay in your lane.” That season was too much fun, even the sucky Jed parts of it were entertaining as hell.
I think Clayton’s was more dramatic than Pilot Pete’s, when it comes to the leads’ storylines (& the girls too) Pilot Pete’s season became more juicy after airing. I mean, even till today it keeps giving😂 but I think based on what was aired Clayton’s was more dramatic!
I feel like Clataysha was the most dramatic
Pete was drama from start to finish.
i didn’t even watch pp but had to pick it😹
Desiree.
Colton - whatever happened between Cassie and him afterwards I found it very relatable how he reacted after Cassie left. It was great insight how the show manipulates people in order to get a storyline. Colton was the first lead openly reacting to the things that go on behind the scenes. He smashed that 4th wall.
Brad 1.0 and Brad 2.0
I only watched Hannah's season. Was excited for Hannah B 2.0 season but it never happened.
Claytaisha was very dramatic too, not sure why it wasn’t included!!
[removed]
Where can I stream these seasons so I can experience the drama?? Do I really have to pay per season on Amazon prime? So far that's the only option Ive seen..
PP's season peaked in terms of absolute chaos in so many parts.   Greatest ATFR then BAM Covid Lockdowns lol
Hannah’s after season was equally dramatic, starting from the sleepover, Gigi era, her first Florida visit and ending with quarantine crew, or maybe even slightly later with their YouTube videos and books 😩
![gif](giphy|VHe7SEi35fhWy0F6Mi|downsized)
That was the wildest thing to watch! The eye rolling, her pestering the dad to back her up, dragging Madi, smirking. 10/100 performance.
Yeah, PP and HB tying for this feels completely accurate
you cannot top sweetnums
100%! btw, happy cake day! 🍰
Omg fantastic Gif 😆
This ^^ we got to take it back.
I was going to comment these exact two.  I still think about how crazy these were
Don’t forget rumors about him hooking up with a producer too! Hannah B had a GREAT season but PP’s was by far the wildest and the most dramatic.   Made all the better by the fact that Peter isn’t a bad dude, it’s just that he has one singular brain cell. None of his drama was done maliciously. He’s just dumb.
![gif](giphy|VJGoImG2TgZKsDdGRW)
And Kelley was at his ATFR.
HA really was the major casualty in all of Peter's indecision. I remember his talk with CH on how in love he was with HA before the FRC, when it was so freaking obvious he was trying to convince himself he was when he clearly wasn't. He really had no business proposing to her. When Madi left, it's clear Peter was done with it all. He should have left single.
Jojo on the floor of the bathroom. That was some good stuff.
Yep. I think this is the right answer. I was casual, almost a bored watcher until his season.  I also think Brad choosing no one was dramatic, for the time. (And him coming back for a second time was exciting, for some reason. I wasn’t excited for him. But people were worked up.)  And I think adding spoilers added new drama, so I found Des’s season more dramatic than the ones listed, because of spoilers. Hat tip, RS. He changed the game, and kept me engaged.  And found Jake and Vienna’s breakup the most dramatic. And Courtney and Ben’s engagement super dramatic.  I actually think this show was MORE fun pre-social media.
Oh I should have put him on there! I haven’t seen that season so I totally forgot about him!
The problem with this answer is that Jason was a super boring dude and the only dramatic thing was that he changed his mind. It was extremely dramatic but it was just that one thing.
With Pilot Pete, you could tell the show was a business transaction for him and he wasn’t really looking for a partner … to the point where he didn’t even pretend to take it seriously in the end (I.e switching from Hannah Ann to Madi to Kelley, hooking up with Hannah Brown while the season was airing etc.)  Nick Viall was in a similar mindset, but at least he put in a little effort to not completely embarrass Vanessa.

my sentiments EXACTLY
Oh it was so bad. Poor HB.
I wanted to put Clare’s on here but couldn’t put that many options. I also didn’t watch the early seasons.
Brad’s first season was sooo good
Jason Mesnick absolutely.  Blew my mind!
And also her “bring her home to us” cry scene.
Exactly why I picked that one 😅
Yes I was hoping to see flajnik on here too!
It also had a ton of drama throughout the whole season! (Edit - Ben F's season, realized my wording was vague lol)
Arie for sure!  He broke up with Becca live like that then would not just fucking leave !  It was gold
Right. I will die on the hill that Jason switching was the really big "oh shit" moment for this show. Plus was Melissa not the first to then go onto Dancing with the Stars? Literally cannot say Arie when Jason did it first lol
sorry I should have included them, I didn’t watch the early seasons but now that everyone is commenting about Jason’s season I feel like I should!
Facts
Arie had the most post-final rose drama.
I can't believe they did Victoria like that. Her face when she knew it was Chase. Poor Peter had no idea.
Tbh, looking back, Luke P deserves more credit for the drama he provided that season. Literally all the most memorable moments originated with him. The kilt rugby smack down and ensuing drama, the 5’8” villain insult, the time with the guy who threw the bologna, the “I had sex in a windmill 4 times and Jesus still loves me” moment, the time Hannah picked up the podium and moved it…all because of Luke P, MVP of the season
Same. As far as criteria of “on camera drama”, fence jump is beyond dramatic.
💯
But Jason walked before Arie which is why this poll is flawed from the jump
Arie was the first season I ever watched. The switcheroo was BANANAS. Then they just kept being dramatic.
Chase rice?  Like the singer?
I will never understand why people think HB’s was the best season. Nearly every episode was spent on the Luke P drama and she canceled almost every cocktail party. You’re right, it was just frustrating to watch
Can’t forget Champagne-gate.
Yes, I would have picked that for sure. It was a situation that we’ve never seen before- with the show basically shut down and confirmation that they do have a backup lead.   Also, not everyone here saw it but Jake Pavelka’s ending was pretty shocking, along with the famous post-show interview.
[GIF](https://imgur.com/a/QYqVI51)
Agree!
Yes! Kelsey and Ashley I sitting on opposite sides of the island as Chris flies away in the helicopter is a top ten BN moment.
+1 Chris soules is my pick
The rest of the season was pretty low key though!
She left her damn EYELASHES on the floor
I CRIED lol
In case anyone has forgotten....   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2zLdyxIuc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2zLdyxIuc)
Because Jason was first but this poll has recency bias.
Exactly. I feel like Peter's drama was mostly annoying petty stuff (like champagne gate). Even the biggest drama of the season seemed irrelevant because I don't think Peter was invested in either of his top two... I feel like he just wanted to get laid and realized he was on an engagement show so time to get engaged because... ya know, Barb would take away his Xbox if he didn't.  Whereas the drama from Clayton's season was like a dumpster fire into which someone chucked in some parade-quality fireworks-- it was spectacularly bad with some really vibrant moments.
...and yet he was the one lying the whole time...
Same!!
Pretty sure Hulu has a bunch of them?
Don't. Let. Her. Go.
I felt bad for madi until I watched it back and saw madi smirking the whole time
Thank you! ❤️
It’s is! If only it had the sound!
Yes! Waaaay back to the OG switch and the OG pilot! 😂😂
I have seriously watched his season a dozen or so times. He is unironically my fav bachelor.
I loved his messy season, but he really shouldn’t have been bachelor like who thought it was a good idea 🤣
He should have picked Joji!
Who are you and why are you spamming us
This promo/scene lives in my head rent free😭😭😭😭
It was pretty mind bending. Waiting for Ben to send Courtney home and it never happened!  Plus his F2 was a really nice, smart, seemingly normal girl so it was even more surprising.
Trista was on the very first season of DWTS.
And Brad
But not post show! Once he got lauren back, radio silence.
Yes! The show always wants these water cooler moments that everyone will be talking about, even people who don't normally watch, and fence jump was definitely that. It was like something out of the Truman Show.
Edit to add: Courtney Robertson is the most iconic Bachelor “villain”
No the survivor runner up contestant
I think people say HB’s was the best season solely because of the last few episodes. The last few episodes saved it. I do also think it was a pretty season, there were moments that stand out for just being pretty.   But when taken as a whole her season was mostly frustrating. All those canceled cocktail parties and the fact she wouldn’t send Luke home.   Hannah was very gifable. I love the one where she downs the champagne
The Chase Rice moment was mostly entertaining and dramatic for the moment when Pete is processing Victoria’s connection to him   I’m sure that’s exactly why the production invited him and it did create a memorable moment
I don't know, there was DeMario's booty call showing up, DeMario's Uber driver sending him back to the mansion for another chance, Dean's heartbreaking hometown, Whaboom and Blake, Lee and Kenny, Kenny's emotional self-elimination...her season was pretty packed with different types of drama (silly, infuriating, intense, funny).
Oooh yeah I always forget about Jason 😶
That was the most suspenseful finale for sure
“Or what?”
I always felt like he and Jojo might have worked out.
I get that people loathed him at the time because he evoked a kind of triggering evangelical purity culture hate spiral. But at the same time, I grew up extremely evangelical in the south, and Luke P was not a “type” I can say I encountered much. Madi from Peter’s season was, but Luke P was just his own kind of weird.
It’s what made me start watching again after several years.
YES. Iconic.
She looked like Cinderella that season! So pretty!
“Oooh, who’s this?!” is one of the funniest moments in franchise history. But that was funny drama (or, uh, comedy), not serious drama. “I swear on my kittens’ graves” pure camp.  The whole Lee/Kenny situation was awful—having a white supremacist on the season with the first Black lead was disgusting. But it was pretty clear that Rachel wasn’t super interested in either of them as a potential partner (though I think she liked Kenny as a friend and admired him as a parent).  When I think of drama, I’m more thinking about drama relating to who the lead will pick and how the heartbreak and surprise associated with it. The Peter breakup was devastating and most of us thought she’d end up with him, but in retrospect, it was Bryan the whole time. And Bryan and Rachel were cute on her season but lacked drama (probably why they work in real life!)  It’s been several years so I’m probably a bit fuzzy but Peter, Hannah, and Clayton had way more drama on their seasons (probably why they didn’t end up with their F1).
The drama on Peter's season was mostly about the interactions between contestants. There wasn't really a lot of heartbreak there until the end either with Hannah Ann/Madi. Most of those women weren't into him including his F3 and F4.  I think drama is a bit more of an all-encompassing term, but if you're talking specifically about lead-contestant drama then Hannah B's definitely takes the cake. The Luke saga was bonkers.
BTW I voted for Peter but Hannah B was my honorable mention. Chef’s kiss.
But the Hannah Brown / Hannah Ann / Madi drama and the blue sweater breakup and ATFR heard around the world…it was all A LOT is what I’m saying. And the fact that his season just kept going with him later sleeping with Hannah right before his season aired and ending up in an on again off again with Kelley. I love mess idc 🤣
I guess for me the Hannah thing was kind of a nothingburger that was over super quickly and everything else you mentioned was at the end of the season, just like Rachel telling Dean she was falling in love with him and letting him go immediately after, "mediocre life and the case of the missing eyelashes," and the intense back-and-forth at ATFR when they made them watch the finale back live for the first time ever.   Post-season stuff is its own category IMO, though his post-season was definitely one of the messiest.
At home, alone, in a pile of my own self-loathing filth and despair.
 Tubi has Des and Katies season of the Bachelorette and Sean and Juan Pablos season of the bachelor! And if im not mistaken its all for free!
Amazon video has every single season of The Bachelorette all the way back to season 6 (Ali Fedotowsky) and seasons 13-27 of The Bachelor. They vary in price with the most being $20 normally (I've seen the prices fluctuate for specific seasons too).
Thank you thank you!!
Thank you!!
Dw! Always glad to help! :)
No in Canada unfortunately
She’s getting a “sex week” tattoo
Family. Friends. Frozen Pizza.
None of the above. The tattoo probably doesn’t even have a thing to do with that man. Happy Sunday 😂
If anyone’s curious what she actually got, it’s a lightning bolt
Probably April fool
This should be a shit post not Zach attack
So is this couple's tattoo officially a "thing" now?
“I survived sex week and all I got was this dumb tattoo”
oh not the skandoval curse! j/k
Not the most creative comment…
(JK!)
Anyone else dislike April Fool's Day? I don't find the jokes even funny like 99% of the time. It's just a day of people being a bunch of liars lol. That's just not my sense of humor. 🤷‍♀️  Anywho, I'm happy Spring is here. I'll be so glad when all the snow and ice is gone around this time next month.
So today went to crap real fast. Adoption fell through for 2 of my deceased parents 5 cats. Struggling to find homes for these critters which is adding extra anxiety.🥴
Five months until i can quit my job. I can do this 🥲
Found out YouTube TV was offering a 21-day free trial instead of the five days I saw previously, so I made the plunge and cut my cable!  I won’t see any immediate cost savings because of when my cable bills, but hopefully it will save me a little money moving forward! Not a lot once I start paying for YouTube TV but every little bit counts!
Nobody will care or remember these games but there are tons of hints that there’s going to be a new Nancy drew game!! I grew up playing these games and have been waiting years for a new game
The worst are fake breakup and pregnancy announcements.
Ugh that’s so rough even when other things aren’t totally shit, rehoming/finding homes for animals is super hard (why I have 4 cats instead of 2)
I’m at 4.5 😭 counting down with you!
Oooh. I had two of these but never finished them. I was too scared to play alone lol. Maybe I won’t be scared as an adult!
![gif](giphy|xfd8UUJJWRAglcWyqu|downsized)
I think they’re just as good as an adult. You can usually get them off of big fish games for cheap. My fav two are secret of shadow ranch and shadow at the waters edge

Has there been any more confirmation to the rumors that Charity’s season will be filmed entirely in the US?
Circling back to the discourse last night, I feel like that John B video was actually more revealing about Joey's frontrunner status. Which is to say, he's not, imo. Charity walked up, she's standing right beside him, and barely acknowledges him. It's especially telling because at that point in the season, he'd be one of the guys she knows best because he got that 1-1 time with her.
That would suck for her.  If they’re not traveling internationally, the least they should do is allow them to go to Hawaii or Puerto Rico since both are US territory.
They spent too much on Zach’s international travel whose season didn’t bring in that much $$$ in their pockets, so now they have to save money and stay domestic for a good portion of the season. Plus with Mike Fleiss stepping down, it’s def an indication that there’s a lot of factors besides his racism that’s going downhill with the show. It’s just unfortunate this is all happening during Charity’s season. Maybe they’ll go international right before and/or after hometowns?
Does anyone know who the the 1 on 1 today?
Omg, I love Skamania Lodge and Stevenson!!
My home state! Very curious to see the dates they come up with for this week.
I’m not expecting like Peter, Hannah, Arie season level of international travel locations but man that would suck if they don’t get to go abroad. I guess now I’m gonna hope Joey makes it to hometowns because then at least that will be in Hawaii so they can go there. Anyways, I hope production just gets more creative this season with the dates like pls no more hot tub and helicopter dates.
Hopefully we get some pics!
Why aren’t they traveling internationally?  Is it a budget cut reason or something?
I live in Vancouver WA. It’s a very random place for the bachelor to decide to film lol.
I hope that isn’t true lol it will be so boring for her let alone the whole season 😅
Remember when Peter’s ladies heard they were leaving the bachelor mansion? They got so excited and then they heard they were going to Cleveland.  Edit: here’s the thirty second video for anyone who wants a trip down memory lane https://twitter.com/UCBarstool/status/1221966078194192385?lang=en   ![img](1w932oxt3kra1)
That makes me wonder if Joey is more of a production favorite than a favorite of Charity’s. Jason T follows him, so he could be one of the people who goes far based on a BN connection.
Yep! And i'm gonna assume that Aaron S was the one that got the first group date rose, because she was chatty with him as well.
https://preview.redd.it/co4rt7fqclra1.jpeg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=19b8c690186a0b0be94d1c34fe8cdc5cc243f3cf  Get it John B! 🔥
What video was he in?
I wouldn’t be surprised if John B gets a one-on-one date on Weeks 3 and 4, that’s usually when frontrunners like FIR or F1 get one-on-ones! Charity was all eyes on John B on that group date and barely acknowledged Joey who was right next to her and walked past all the other men.
An individual who was actually there stated that Charity seemed the most relaxed with Michael and Charity.   I'm not saying John B won't make it far, just don't know if this video means he's some THE frontrunner.
Both Puerto Rico and USVI are territories in the US, I wonder overnights and final dates might be either in those locations. Chris Soules's season had only mostly in the US.
That’s not how traveling works for this show. The producers don’t spend money to travel. They reach out to the city months beforehand and negotiate a package. The city comps the show when they visit. Meaning that the city gives them free hotel rooms, free admissions to events and facilities, etc. For Clayton’s season, Houston basically gifted the show nearly $250,000 through its tourism fund and taxpayers were less than pleased.  But I do think the show becoming less popular means that cities are less likely to offer a really good travel package to the producers.
The unfortunate problem that Chris Soules’s season had begun travelling international to Bali, Indonesia after hometowns and returned to the US for the final dates.
Group date is today, 1-on-1 happened yesterday and happens tomorrow.
Episode 4 is usually a US location (Houston for Clayton, Cleveland for Peter, Rhode Island for Hannah, ect) so I don’t think it means anything yet.   Becca didn’t get international travel at all until the week before hometowns. Sometimes they just get a raw deal.
I heard it was for budget reasons. But again I’m not sure if this is true or not still. I’m hoping it’s not.
What makes you wonder that?
i will never forget this because the city of cleveland sent out roses and a themed box in celebration.  i’m from michigan, so i took this personally… and i also didn’t give them my address. very ohio.

Sixth slide. She's standing right in front of John B., Joey is also behind Charity, but to John's left. https://www.instagram.com/p/CqZeBrBM4H1/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=
They were super super late (at least it semeed so even for camera people around, not just only for me.. ) for the date.. so i can see why she didnt acknowledge any of the other guys.. they needed to start soon.. (we had been waiting there for 2 hours, sunlight might impact film, and the date started 5pm ish) but then, once she is in the front.. i agree she seems to pay more attention to john b than joey… in the performance itself, joey seems more romantic, john b more sex chemistry (see comment below)..
I think ep 5 is often when the F1 gets a date?
We're in week 4 now, and for the bachelorette it's usually week 3 and 5.
Despite the replies, my comment isn't actually about thinking John B's F1. It's saying that people reading so much into her interaction with John from that video, but I think it was more telling about Joey. I know what people said about who was getting special attention. But i'm saying that Charity walking up, standing beside Joey since he was at the front with John, but not really greeting or acknowledging, him makes me think he's not the frontrunner he's been made out to be. It's all just opinions & speculation at this point.
Who did they send them out to?
Thanks! I agree, Joey didnt have her attention at all. Her and John B. are so comfortable with each other though, wow!
She was definitely feel the guy in the nude onesie...all up in his personal space and kept looking back to talk to him. Also, the little titty jiggle in slide 7, the naysayers made it sound like she has no personality.
Hmm interesting... What was Tanner like?
Correct! Episode 5 for FIR recipient and episode 3 for The Bachelor.
This is more for the Bachelor…not so much the Bachelorette seasons.
There’s people here who were actually present in person at the show and are saying her and John B had a lot of chemistry. So it’s not just the video, but at least it captured somewhat what people saw during the date.b No one is really concluding he’s FIR or the projected F1 right now but just speculating.
to press! i worked at a women’s outlet at the time doing bachelor coverage but was freelance.
I feel both are some what at least producers favorites… john b wayyyy more outgoing/aggressive than joey on their song performance..  john b kissed charity at the performacd.. accoridng to my friend who was watxhing frim a different angle “a lot of tongue”.. and very awkard moment..
No kidding, they legit look like a couple that happens to be surrounded by other dudes in that vid
People who attended the date said she was super fun! Definitely not “boring” like others claim.
Tanner seemed serious and nice guy…I liked him a lot
No, it's the bachelorette, I don't keep track of the bachelor to see if it's similar 😉. Over the last 8 years or so many, if not most, F1s have had ep 5 dates. Andi, JoJo, Rachel, Kaitlyn, Michelle. Hard to count the covid Ette seasons in this, though.
That’s kind of fun! Did they find you anyway? (Despite not giving them your address?)
Well for Becca, HB, Tayshia, Rachel R/Gabby it’s been Ep 3 and 4.  If you look at bachelordata episode 5 is very prevalent for The Bachelor.
yup! i got a tiny bottle of wine from ohio that i drank in quarantine desperation, a sweatshirt that went to my neighbors, and a really nice glass that i still use!
I'd say Tayshia's the outlier here because she came in late. Will be interesting to see what it is this season since the last two seasons weren't the same. I just know I'm putting all my eggs in FIR guy's basket since he'll have the best chance at F1 based off history. Anxious to know.
Now you know what Ohio wine tastes like!
I was going off third episode from when her part of her season started. And when I say Weeks 3 and 4. Technically that lumps in Ep. 3-5 together, because in real time, night one episode 1 doesn’t count as week 1 and ep 2 counts as week 1.
Oop, got it. Thanks!
Hey I was posting her a lot more regularly but have been MIA. I have been dating someone for a couple months.  It's actually been a kind of whirlwind but a really healthy whirlwind. Since like the second or third time we hung out we have been really open and great at communicating. I feel like nothing is off the table when it comes to talking about the relationships and stuff.  He makes me laugh and he thinks I'm very funny and smart. It's really wonderful just getting to hang out with someone who seems like a kind, mature guy. He also has been really supportive and willing to listen and help me talk out some big life decisions that have come up for me recently. I am really impressed with how kind and patient he is. :D
I was at lunch with my colleague last week - we're pretty close, have a fun dynamic and some chemistry but I pretty much treat her like any other friend cause she has a BF (and it's easy to be wrong about this stuff anyway).    Anyway, we got a bit tipsy and she said she wanted to clear the air - followed by telling me if she was single, we'd have already had a lot of sex (before also saying she loves her BF and has no intention to be single any time soon)   I understand that when you have an SO, you are still attracted to other people, so maybe she just felt like she needed to get that out there and continue as normal - which she seems to be doing.   At the time I was very flattered ofcourse but this feels like a complicated situation and I am not sure how to interact with her going forward.       My gut is to just to be straight up and tell her it's left me a bit confused and unsure on how to interact with her now - but is that just going to make this situation get more complicated?     Exclusively attracting women with BFs so far in 2023 and not sure why - it is not ideal.
I think I want my SO of 8 years to move out. This shit is so hard but they’ve just turned into a complete asshole and I can’t take the every day criticism anymore. I’m 37 so it’s fucking scary but damn whatever, I want an apartment to myself again and don’t care about dating anymore.
[Update to this Sunday Dating comment I made here](https://www.reddit.com/r/thebachelor/comments/11vixa1/sunday_dating_and_relationships_thread_march_19/jcuvx4v/?context=3)  We went out, it was good but I wasn't feeling the romantic connection I was hoping for, and I told her that. She said the same thing. She's good friends with one of my friends and I said I'd be happy to be friends though, which is true.  Now I'm back to square one of having my eyes open but not actively looking (I don't have the energy to get Hinge yet, again).
made a post last week about my breakup. yesterday was my birthday. he didn’t wish me a happy birthday. we were best friends first and foremost, so I didn’t expect him not to say anything on my birthday of all days. he was supposed to be flying down on Thursday to spend a birthday weekend with me. I am hurting so badly. we’ve been no contact for a few weeks but it genuinely feels like it’s been months
Not a ~romantic~ concern but a friendship concern. I’ve realized recently my friends have majorly let me down.   I got in a fight with my best friend in 2020 before the pandemic, privately made up with her and worked on the relationship. Since then, I’ve felt extremely distant from the rest of my friends, and unsure why they all flipped a switch on me bc I so cherished our relationships. Have come to realize (way way way after the fact) that my ex bestie said something to the rest of them to distance them from me (probably related to the fight we had), and I was so in denial about this fact it took me literally years to realize.   Literal years of slight digs, being ignored, middle school dynamics. Openly making plans without me, talking about me behind my back, icing me out. With girls I considered my sisters, for some reason. Sad sad sad.   Not sure if I should say something. At this point I know nothing will change but I just feel so disappointed and sad. And have realized I’ve been carrying so much pain and confusion for the last few years — I just want it to go somewhere.
One of my friends is going through a difficult time right now, and is experiencing some depression symptoms. I wanted to help ease the load so they can recover better. Some ideas I had were:     Cook food/order delivery for us  Offer to do the dishes/help clean  And in general just ask how they're doing every once in awhile     Do you all have any other ideas?
I come bearing an update on my new guy I was seeing who went to Cuba. He came back after no contact and immediately ended things. So… LOL. How do you all get the strength to keep going on dating apps? I try to stay positive but man …  it’s tough 😓
👋 I’ve recently been on a small break from dating after meeting up with EIGHT guys since the new year. Either i felt no spark, they didn’t, or well, the guy i somewhat liked and was initiating a lot ghosted me after sex. I feel ok about it now, just a good learning experience.   I think sometimes I’m not cut out for dating in nyc, but then I remember I am 24 and need to do more hobbies. Only having Monday and Tuesdays nights to do stuff does wear on me and as the weather gets nicer..I may have to get even more creative. Sometimes its hard to compare myself to all my friends and siblings who are in relationships and here I am, still very single.Trying to conclude I am on my OWN life path and have different barometers, and still putting myself out there to even make friends which has been quite hard tbh. Bumble bff has not worked well for me, and I’m not meeting girls I’m clicking with. Finally dawned on me tho that I will need to try to put myself out there solo more unfortunately - thinking comedy shows and exercise classes. My schedule just makes it a bit difficult.  Anyways I am trying my best!!!!
Veterans, please give me tips on how to make long-distance relationships work swimmingly well. My partner is moving to Europe and we won't be able to see each other for at least six months. I am only moving end of this year and I haven't done long distance in over a decade. Any apps, suggestions will be uber helpful.
6 dates with a guy, half of them at least partly at my place and we haven’t even made out let alone had sex??  I thought maybe it was me not showing enough interest so I literally told him I’m not good at initiating but he should feel free to. And still, nothing. Any other guy has made it happen to so I’m not being different than I have before.. We have kissed but it’s never anything deep, and I’m not the one ending it or pulling away.   Like last time it was a hello peck, and a goodbye kiss. Yet he happily nicely touches me when we sat together, just didn’t start any kissing.  Also my ex rejected and shamed me so much that I really don’t think I can be the one to try to start anything. Even this time once this guy left and we didn’t do anything again, really got to me. I’m so confused! I have a high drive so I don’t want to be with someone who doesn’t want to much but I don’t know if that’s the reason.
I love relationships, always have. I have gone through the ringer and have learned a lot but even before that I would love giving advice to my friends when I was young. I was always the person who could give really honest, clear advice to others even though I had my own blind spots. I’ve been taking personal development courses while having a coach of sorts for 8 years and I’ve been in therapy for 1.   I want to do something with this passion but not sure which path to take. I don’t want to go back to school for a lot of money/time to get psychology certifications, although that seems like the most reputable option and best for my social anxiety. I’ve also thought about getting coaching certificates and going that route, but the controversial nature of that gives me anxiety, even though I know I wouldn’t scam people. Even doing something like a dating advice podcast sounds fun, but when you have no credibility it seems daunting.   Anyone else out there looking for or found an outlet for their desire to talk relationships and give advice? What kinds of things are out there? Thanks!
So it’s been a while that a guy randomly comes up to talk to me. Some guys were trying to hit on my friend and I at the bar and while nice that someone found us attractive, we really didn’t want guys who were almost 40 hitting on us. When told “don’t you think we are too young?” They said no. 😏 They looked their age, even older. Hopefully next time it’s a better evening. I know age gaps are always debated or excused, but my friend I that evening were talking about what age gap we we’re comfortable with and those guys were 5+ years over it. Dating sucks!
That's a lovely update!
I'm happy for you!
This was extremely selfish of her. She didn’t consider your feelings or her relationship/boy friend.   I think you dodged a bullet. Imagine if you were her boyfriend, she’d be doing the same thing to you.
Absolutely selfish of her.  She didn't clear up anything,and only made it uncomfortable for you.
Yikes. Yeah, I’d put up boundaries after that. You guys still work together. This is one where “don’t shit where you eat” comes to mind.
Yeah, she shouldn’t have done that. If you’re committed to your SO and find yourself attracted to someone else, the respectful thing to do is keep your mouth shut and distance yourself from that person. If she’s willing to cross that line, that’s a red flag. Out of respect for her bf, I’d leave it be if I were you. Don’t entertain this. It sounds like she might enjoy the attention/be keeping you on the hook as a back-up option, and you deserve better than that. So does her bf.  I’ve been her and I regret it. It’s selfish; people get hurt. I would encourage anyone not to go down that road.
Yiiikes. Seems like she is looking to cheat with you. I don’t see any other reason she’d voice this outloud.
This is….odd. Something similar happened with my coworker. We connected really well from the first day we met. Instant chemistry. I came home from a work trip and remember telling my mom “so I met this guy…”. He even showed up at a bar I frequent one night looking to see if I’d be there (I’ve posted about this before on this thread actually). Come to find out MONTHS after the fact, he has a gf. Like, mind blown. I thought for sure he was interested and was being somewhat cautious because we worked together. Lots of mixed signals there. The tension and chemistry didn’t exactly abate after that even though nothing happened between us. I don’t really have any advice to give; I can only say I empathize because I’ve been there and I know how wildly frustrating it is, especially if you’ve developed feelings for the person and they mess with your head.
You got this, friend. Good luck.
I always enjoy your updates. :) Wishing you the best!
I’m very happy she approached you, I’m sure it gave you some additional confidence. It’s ok that there wasn’t a romantic connection, you had fun and made a friend.
I’m so sorry you’re hurting but you’ve broken up and gone no contact, wishing you a happy birthday would be cruel to you both. It’s for the best even if it doesn’t feel good :(
 No contact can hurt like crazy even if it’s for the best and I’m really sorry you are going through those feelings on your bday; I recently went through the same thing on my own bday.
This would not be for me. Not having friends except women you’ve met on dating apps is such a huge red flag for me.
I feel like if it’s still early in the relationship and there are things that are (understandably) giving you pause it’s okay to call it quits. Just from your comments it sound like you want more experience (socially and in the bedroom) than this guy has to offer and that is perfectly okay.
The virgin thing personally I think is not that big of a deal as long as you’re okay with showing him the ropes, but mileage varies! I would be more concerned about his only friends being people he once tried to date. Maybe I’m just being judgemental, but something about that seems off to me. Is it something where he wants to make friends elsewhere but hasn’t been able to? If so, where is he getting tripped up? Or is he happy with the current situation? I think I would need more details to fully decide how I felt about it.
Did he explain why he was a virgin until he met his ex? He would have been in his 30s already when they started dating, and usually there's a specific reason someone is still a virgin at that age (doesn't have to be a bad reason but still something I'd want to understand).  I think there are some serious concerns here. The primary one is him having no friends beyond previous romantic prospects. But also him not really disclosing why his six-year relationship ended and you already feeling like you have to educate him about basic things like social cues.  I would personally not recommend staying with someone just because you're apprehensive about other prospects. It sounds like you have some significant, legitimate hesitations here and that's a lot for a relationship that hasn't even reached the official stage yet. Don't date someone for their potential, date them for who they are. If they're not the right person for you as they are, that's not judgy to recognize.
Hmm well I guess it depends on what you’re looking for in a relationship. Like to me this guy seems like a project, one that you’re going to have put time and effort into. And maybe that sounds appealing to you since you’ll be a team and he’ll learn from you.   But maybe that doesn’t sound appealing to you and you want someone who has more life experience and is more together. I know you mentioned that he’s employed and has his own apartment but to me at 40 that’s the bare minimum an adult should have. I’m not sure how old you are but when I was in my late 20s I was looking for something serious and for a man who had hobbies, family aspirations, friends, a good career, a home, and that he knew how to be a fully fledged adult without some kind of woman taking care of him.   At the end of the day you’ll have to examine how he makes you feel and remember that you can’t really date potential. So if there are aspects about him that give you pause or the ick when you think about pursuing a long term relationship you may need to listen to your gut. To me the fact that you’re even thinking about dating others makes me think deep down you know this guy isn’t the one for you.
Men who have no male friends worry me.
Do you care about sex that much? I simply can’t see an active healthy sex life with someone who has made it to 40 and they’re still just like ah well
Have you heard of attachment theory and avoidant attachment? I would look it up, it helped me so much with guys like this. I felt drawn to helping them and thought they could “get there”. The closer I got the more distance they gave. In his 40s and never had sex, there’s no reason for that other than his own uncomfort and avoidance.  And that’s just one example of the many red flags you said here (no friends, 1 ex, doesn’t share details about the ex…)   At a minimum keep an eye on how much effort you make vs. his. Does he initiate as much as you? If he doesn’t, stop and see if he does. I suspect the farther along y’all get, whenever he hits his discomfort limit he will stop initiating.
Why not keep it casual and continue dating him and others until you have more clarity?  One thing is for sure, he'd be willing to keep you as a friend if you're willing.
I'm most concerned about the friend thing. MAYBE he is neurodivergent and has had trouble building social skills? But it makes me wonder why he doesn't even have friends from 20s or 30s?
Run
I gotta say, these things would be pretty big turn offs for me personally. Not just because he’s a 40 year old virgin, but why would he be in a relationship for six years, in his 30s, and not have sex until marriage. And I know we’ve all got our issues, but this screams issues when combined with his not having any friends outside women he’s dated. It just seems like someone who isn’t in line with my way of life, like he’s just letting life happen to him vs taking charge and making changes.
Straight guy here with an opinion. The virgin thing makes me wonder what his future libido would be like once he loses his virginity. I don't think it's a big deal to have to "show him the ropes".  It's a muuuuch bigger yikes that his only friends are women he's met on dating apps. Are the other ladies on the same page? Why doesn't he like his fellow men? Just seems strange.  If you get along though, I'd say keep dating while also dating other people, don't put your eggs in his basket yet or at all.
I feel like if people bought into her side of the story or her comments so easily without actually talking to you they weren't very good friends to begin with. Just know if you do say anything it will only be for your benefit, it unfortunately will probably fall on deaf ears.  You will find people who cherish your friendship as much as you do theirs. It shouldn't be so easy to dismantle a friendship.
Something that always helped me was getting me outside. Even if I didn’t feel like it. Something as simple as being “forced” to go on a walk would end up making me feel better every time.
You are such a good friend. 💕 Seriously, your friend is very lucky to have you.   I would suggest maybe also have like a movie marathon or a tv night (reality tv binge session) together every once or twice a month? That way it can be a distraction that the both of you can look forward to.  Hopefully, this is a helpful suggestion. 🙂
I would really recommend trying to make plans with them. Try to make plans and keep it simple, like go on a walk or have coffee in your pjs, invite her over for dinner, etc. I know when I feel depressed it can take me hours to get ready to go out of the house and then I feel so guilty. Keeping it low key can really help.  Maybe you could have friends organize to send check in texts, or even send her mail One of the best feelings ever was when I shared with a volunteer group I was apart of I was having a hard time. It was in the height of lockdowns and no one was leaving my house. I asked if someone could do a meds check with me, and my friend would text me everyday around 9 or 10 am to remind me to take my meds. All through out the week I was getting random texts just asking how it was going. It just felt good to feel like people were thinking of me everyday.
Your friend is lucky to have you as their friend. 💕 I’m sure they’d appreciate any and all of these.
Do you have a romantic interest in them?
Dang thank you for the update.. his loss, you seem cool!
Omg i was so invested in this too, i am so sorry 😭 i feel the same. I take breaks tbh and try different hobbies
That sucks, I'm sorry! Whenever I'd get burnt out on apps I'd take a break. Pour the dating energy into yourself - hobbies, solo dates, spending time with friends, catching up on books, exercising, whatever. The weather's getting nicer which helps!
I’d love to connect girl as I’m planning to make the move to NYC in July. I’m gonna DM you. I’m 25, female, in marketing and would love to make connections there (If that’s not too weird 😜). I love your updates BTW. I’m sorry you are not having much luck
I’m 30F and have been in NYC for 8 years. I’ve met every single longterm partner “in the wild” even though I’ve done app dating off and on the whole time. I was single for a year and a half before meeting my current partner, because nothing materialized on the apps. My best advice would be to focus on developing your own hobbies and friend group — the more you put yourself into new environments, the more opportunities to meet new potential partners (in addition to making your own life more fulfilling).   Also keep in mind that 24 in NYC is basically a baby and many men in your age group on the apps will not be interested in something super serious. People here settle down much later than in other areas of the country.
if you like running or want to get into it.... run groups are so good for meeting people. I don't do well with dating apps or bumble bff, it just feels too forced
How do you feel overall about making the move to NYC?
In my last LDR we talked on the phone every night. It became a habit, part of our day, and I felt really close to him from it. It actually was always long distance however he became a core part of my life  from this and I took the breakup super hard.   And in the NSFW category, I’m not sure if you have an interest in consensual power play, they make vibrators that can be controlled over long distance via the internet and an app. So one long distance partner can turn it on/off for the other partner. I guess this doesn’t have to just be in a power play dynamic but that’s how we discussed using it 🤣
The good news is that having a clear plan for when the long distance will end makes it about a thousand times easier. I would say just talk openly about planning times to have virtual dates every week to stay connected and remember that this is temporary!
Just talk to him directly.
Maybe you should try to be more....direct and communicative in that department... He could be less experienced and conscious about it. This isn't your ex and maybe raise that bad experience with this partner if you're comfortable emotionally doing so. Now is the time to figure this stuff out before going any further.
My fuzzy memory of first dating my now husband 15 years ago - held hands on 3rd date - first kiss date 4ish - made out date 6ish  At the time I was confused why he wasn’t making moves. Turns out Mr laidback was nervous because he really REALLY liked me. (Still does!)  Your “problem” doesn’t register to me as a problem at all. If you want to make out with your guy, do not text him, do not have a conversation. Just initiate a dang kiss.
> so I literally told him I’m not good at initiating but he should feel free to.  You basically 50% of the way initiated, why not go the full 100% and do it yourself? Instead of potentially 6 more dates later and still wondering.
I agree coaching is *very* controversial and it doesn't seem like the trainings really set people up for success in that field. I am doing a masters in social work, and if you wanna DM me I would be open to talking about it. :D  The nice thing is that post-covid most counseling related masters programs are pretty flexible. Obviously, finances are an issue for most people, but  I did undergrad 10 years ago & the scheduling and accessibility has improved since then.
I'm not sure if you're specifically looking for a career path involving advice, but if you're just looking for a hobby outlet there are relationship advice subs (r/relationships and r/relationship_advice). Might scratch that itch while you figure out if there's a way to use it professionally.
Even if age gaps are up for debate, what matters is what you are attracted to! Preferences are okay. Personally I am in my mid/late-thirties (37 and I’ve heard this categorized and mid and late depending who you ask) and guys I find sexually attractive range from late 20s-late 30s. A guy with an “older” look just doesn’t do it for me. My ideal partner would probably be like, 34.
Yeah, that was completely inappropriate and selfish. Being attracted to somebody while you’re in a relationship is one thing - verbalizing it to them is another issue entirely. It feels like she’s trying to throw OP just enough of a line to keep them on the back burner so they’ll continue to give her attention. Not okay.
 Thankyou - I was thinking it felt a bit selfish too.       But we work in a small team and I see her everyday, so not really dodged anything!
This- how you get them is how you lose them, at least most of the time.
I had a romance with an colleague after they left last year and even that was too much - this woman knows I have no interest in doing the workplace thing, maybe that's why she felt comfortable saying it.
My most recent ex was like this. All his friends were women, which I tried to be open-minded about until it slowly came out that he'd either been romantically involved with each of them or had met them on the apps.   In hindsight, my gut was right and I didn't listen to it.
It’s a huge red flag to me. I dated a guy who’s only close friend was his ex girlfriend and it just… was not good. You don’t have to be a social butterfly (I’m not), but if you can’t emotionally connect with people you aren’t trying to date… NOPE! Or if you can’t maintain long term friendships, that’s another red flag
He is happy in his current situation....and almost blissfully unaware of how not having friends might be an issue.

We have a park nearby that we can go to! Helps that the weather is getting warmer too
Yeah this is a great suggestion! I'll try to see if I can schedule something like that regularly. Or just something to do for a hang out.
Awesome I"ll do that! I'll just keep it low key with food, and  playing things like board games, and going on walks(if they're down). I'll keep the check up and just ask how they're doing from time to time.  The mail is a good idea too. Sending a card would be a cool surprise.
Nah we're just platonic. I just wanted to support them during a difficult time.
Awe thanks! Moving on, I suppose! Bigger and better things etc
The man had the nerve to tell me it wasn’t going anywhere then invited me to his birthday party “as friends” I for real don’t understand men LOL yes I think that’s a good idea! The weather is finally getting nicer so I think it’s time I invest in some new hobbies :)
I feel like a lot of men in NY don’t start looking to settle down until their mid 30s
Definitely good to hear another side to this cause everyone I know met their partner off of an app. I’m all for trying new stuff and classes just having two free nights a week is tough but doable in the city at least compared to a small town.   Yeaaah I am trying to stay optimistic at least. I just would like it if a guy seemed eager to get to know me for once instead of just like half assed hangouts and feeling like he’s counting down the moments to have sex. Any classes or hobbies you have enjoyed to do around the city?
I honestly have barely scratched the surface of exploring yet and feel like I need to try a lot more. I really enjoy it so far though and can’t really see myself anywhere else at the moment. I moved from Philly which I miss somewhat in odd ways but I think thats just bc philly is a smaller city and feels familiar.   Just noticed a lot of people are worn down by the “grind” and I am not fully there yet I don’t think at least
Yeah I should’ve said something when he was here but now I’ll text something about how I’m confused and I’ve been wanting to make out haha. I’m just worried what the reason might be because every single guy I’ve dated in the past years tried something within 2-5 dates
He’s definitely not inexperienced or shy though. And I know he’s not but that just like trained me to be scared to. If it wasn’t the first time maybe I could but he hasn’t really shown me that he would even want to, considering he seems to stop the kissing. So thats why I clearly told this guy I’m not good at it but that he can initiate anytime.
Well I’m glad I did text and VERY glad I didn’t try anything because it turns out the reason is he’s not interested
I wouldn’t have gone 6 more dates anyway but I’m very glad I didn’t try anything because apparently he’s not interested
Thanks! I’m curious how you find the field of work and if you would recommend it for an “absorber” person (I tend to absorb people’s emotions). It’s like I want to help and know I could but I also know I could be totally drained after helping 1 client. But post Covid it seems a lot of therapists are working remotely which would help me a LOT with that I think.
Yeah I’m looking for both hobby and professional ideas! Thanks for the idea. I have followed those subs and observe them more like TV, a lot of the popular posts seem so obvious or fake. I also solely use Reddit on my phone so typing long responses feels like a chore, ha! But it’s worth trying out for sure.
Preferences are okay but not when it extends to hitting on someone in public where there’s a general societally accepted reason they might be uncomfortable. I would think it’s pretty well known that younger women may be uncomfortable with a visually older guy hitting on them
This was done to me; it feels really shitty especially because in my case I had developed real feelings for this guy.
Hmm, to me that would be a signal that we aren’t on the same wavelength. Good luck in finding clarity with all of it!
No idea what this implies
Awesome! Happy to help! 🙂
Ok great. The reason I ask is that nothing feels worse than finding out a friend was just pretending to care about you to get in your pants and then they ignore you when they find out you're dating/seeing someone. Horrible feeling.  Anyway, those are all sweet ideas! I think cooking feels more personal and thoughtful than ordering. Asking how they're doing here and there is really thoughtful too.
I've never taken classes in the city, but I did/do volunteer quite a bit. I've done sports clubs and running clubs before too. I started a weekly Bachelor watch group at a bar in Manhattan. I made friends in the theatre community (both actors and appreciators).  Of my actual relationships in the city, the first I met through work (worked adjacent, but not together), second was at a silent disco in Queens, third was at a friend's birthday party, and current is actually my Super lol.
Comparing isn't necessarily helpful though, I mean you didn't end up with those guys anyway
I wouldn't text about this if it's actually something that's important to you.  I would use this as an opportunity to practice being brave and initiating. Don't let your ex control your behavior, take the power back. Next time he's over just make a move while you're sitting there. He may also be bad at initiating and someone simply needs to break that barrier.
What the hell, why was he still going on dates with you then??
I'm glad you found out but WOW that is shitty for him for leading you on like that. If he didn't like you, six dates is plenty of time to figure it out and tell you. Sorry you had to deal with that bozo.
Yes, I would recommend learning how to mentally set boundaries to not take on peoples emotions when you leave. You need to be able to connect but you need to be able to turn it off. It is definitely draining, I'm not gonna lie about that. I am a new type of tired. However I find a lot of other things more draining that the emotions. I can talk about dark shit all day any day, I like to hear about heartbreak and grief. I find it much more draining to try to squeeze info out of disorganized thinkers and quiet people. Most of my clients didn't choose to be there and they aren't always cooperative. This is my first job post-grad though, so I didn't expect it to be a perfect fit.    However, if you love relationships and working through problems it's a perfect place for that. Social work is cool because it's a very broad field. You can do one on one counseling, schools, community, nursing homes, etc.
I know that, I was responding to OP stating that “age gaps are always debated or excused” in case she felt she might get criticism for not being interested in any older guy, not just these ones who approached her. I’m tired so I hope that made sense!
[removed]
Awesome! I'll tell them about the idea and see what they want to do.
Idk a text is fine I think. It doesn’t have to be some big serious thing. A flirty ‘so I really want to make out with you’ to breach the waters is totally fine.
I don’t really see why not to text him. I want to know what he’d say.   I feel if I were to start trying to initiate it wouldn’t be for the first time with a guy who doesn’t even seem like he wants to make out. And I told him I’m bad at it, so I’d think if he was too he’d probably have said so?
Who knows, because as if dating didn’t already suck, nobody knows what they’re doing or how to be clear apparently. He even said things like how he’d do some favor for me because “he wants to keep me around” etc. maybe he didn’t know for sure until I said I was waiting for him to make out. He did send a “nice” message saying sorry etc but whatever.
Haha thanks.. the worst thing is like I really thought he seemed like a good guy. How can you keep dating when you can never tell if someone sucks or not :/
That is cool! I didn’t realize how broad social work could be.
Ah didn’t mean to misinterpret! I thought you meant bc you tend to go for a younger group it wasn’t weird that the guys made it known they went younger

I was more referring to her bringing up that she's confused, which seems like a more serious tone to set. That's expressing an actual issue, not just a flirty desire for intimacy.
I just generally feel like text is not the place for conversations that are actually meaningful/important to you. Tone can easily be misconstrued and can cause issues that wouldn't happen in person.  You're making a lot of assumptions for him that probably aren't helpful to you. He may well think that you don't want to make out either because *neither* of you are initiating. He may have thought that you saying you don't really initiate was you subtly trying to imply that you didn't really want to make out with him yet. He may also be bad at it but feels self-conscious about that so didn't say anything. You don't know so there's no reason to get ahead of yourself thinking that he doesn't want to be intimate with you.  If you absolutely do not want to initiate or talk about this in person and want to bring it up over text, I would be flirtatious about it rather than telling him you're confused.
WTF! That’s so ridiculous. Ugh I’m sorry. What a self centered asshole! You deserve MUCH better
It's really tough. Any advice I would give is what you're already doing though - being direct, getting clarity and getting answers so you can move along to something better. He sucks but you handled this like a pro. Also our usernames are so similar!
No worries at all! Glad I could clarify.
That’s true I don’t know. But when I said I’m not good at initiating, I also said he should feel free to. Which I kind of felt was suggesting that he should, but he didn’t. And I feel like every time that we have kissed, he’s the one who pulled back. Maybe we just don’t understand each other but this has never happened before so I don’t think it would be me not giving enough when we actually did kiss.   I guess I also wanted to text because I wouldn’t really want to see him again if there’s an actual reason that’s not compatible with me. Because these times were we just have little peck kisses is making me lose interest quite a lot. Maybe that’s being too harsh or judging quickly though.   I could probably mention it in a way that is more silly, flirty, than just sounding like I’m accusing or something though, that’s a good point.
It’s so weird because he seemed like such a genuinely good guy :/
Aw thanks! That’s so nice to hear. And I never would’ve noticed that but that’s cool, clearly we’re both awesome hahah
Part of what's difficult about getting to know someone romantically is that you don't know what their boundaries are and aren't necessarily comfortable enough with each other yet to be super direct. He could be thinking a million things that have nothing to do with not wanting to kiss you. Just as you're analyzing his thought process, he may be doing the same with you and it's resulting in both of you staying at a standstill.  I'd give it a shot to see if you can generate something more intimate this time, and if it doesn't happen maybe at the end of the night you can bring it up directly and see what the deal is.
