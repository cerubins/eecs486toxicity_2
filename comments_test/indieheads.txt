couple of surprises this week, namely the sudden appearance of HMLTD's sophomore record and the new Daughter album which I thought was due for the end of this month.  that Wednesday record is lovely too.  ///  resources for a more exhaustive list of releases from this week:  [heavyblogisheavy release roundup for 3/31](https://www.heavyblogisheavy.com/2023/04/07/release-day-roundup-4-7-23/)  [sputnikmusic list for 4/7](https://www.sputnikmusic.com/blog/2023/04/04/weekly-releases-4-07-2023/)  [albumoftheyear charts for March (sort to your liking)](https://www.albumoftheyear.org/2023/releases/april-04.php?s=release&type=lp)

I do a playlist called [Singled Out](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0QGts9ViNDZOU2VGCJzMya?si=-h3yqaRMS0qi7k-53aOWfg&utm_source=copy-link) of new release singles of the week for the whole year.  I update it every Friday if anyone's interested.  The first 15 tracks are for this week.  Everything after that is previous weeks going back to the first of the year. (( Last years 2022 tracks are all being taken out soon. It's already archived in the Singled Out 2022 playlist. ))  Highlights This Week:   Brooklyn Indie-Pop now solo project of Jonny Pierce, The Drums drop the 1st single for an undesignated upcoming new album.  This feels like a return to form for The Drums and hopefully is an indicator of where the LP will be headed.  Pittsburgh Noise-Rock outfit Feeble Little Horse are fastly becoming one of my fav up & coming bands.  They release their 2nd single for their upcoming 2nd album, their 1st on the Saddle Creek label.  Brooklyn Indie-Pop act Beach Fossils drop their 2nd new single for their upcoming album Bunny due June 2nd.  Hull, UK Shoegaze band bdrmm release their 2nd single for the upcoming 2nd LP I Don't Know due June 30th.  As always from them some really great subtle layering of sounds and genres here.  New York Indie-Rock & Strokes guitarist Albert Hammond Jr. releases the 1st cut for his LP Melodies on Hiatus due June 23rd.

Fuck that, fuck Epic Games, and fuck union busters. Bandcamp needs to voluntarily recognize its workers demand for collective bargaining immediately.

since when has bandcamp been owned by the fortnite people what the fuck
Today I learned that Fortnite owns bandcamp. That absolutely sucks.
lmao what a bunch of fucking losers
Jfc Bandcamp is shilling now, too? This shit is outta control.
I think they got bought out sometime last year
And epic games are partly (majority?) owned by a shadey gigantic Chinese company, Tencent.
Yeah March 2022
(Love the Beatles & Oasis sound on this)
House album, follow up to the one he released last year
So beautiful. This will be on replay in the Fall.
After I heard nothing but mine I had to order the urban outfitters exclusive red vinyl because of how beautiful that song is.
I ordered from her website - she made prints herself that come with each order!
Shipping from her website was really expensive to the us.
Oh it definitely cost me a pretty penny! I try not to think about the shipping cost lol
“first-ever”, I thought this day would never come
First ever between their three solo careers I’m guessing? Poorly worded title, it’s their first full album together…
They also achieved their first ever album
I can't believe boygenius invented the concept of the number 1
About time. I followed them all the way through their negative number albums and when album number 0 came out I was like this has to be it. When that came and passed I'll admit that I gave up hope. But here we are, now. They finally get their first ever with album number one.
happy for them like a normal person
Kd lang cries in the background
Oh fuck me I had him mixed up with someone else. I thought it was a pop act guy with slicked back hair and it's another supergroup from the US.
Holy heck. FOR THE FIRST TIME. /s
Still a big yawn for me
I love phoebe and Julian and wasn’t captured enough by it to give it a second listen. It’s the least ambitious or entertaining album I’ve heard from either of them.
I’m listening to them rn and just saw this post, what bliss!
Can't believe no one's ever done it before.
And the Seattle Kraken just secured their first playoffs! Truly a historical time.
For the first time ever, their first record is first
Yeah, it’s not worded well but it’s not exactly difficult to understand what they mean.
As from now I can't believe on it
Isn’t this their second album?
I think it's pretty good, but I'm perplexed by just how much hype it's getting.    Edit: I guess saying it's "good" is damnation by faint praise. I didn't come in here trashing the band or the album. All three of these artists are talented on their own and together they made something good. But from my perspective the praise "The Record" is getting just seems a bit out of proportion with the quality of the album, which in my opinion is solid but nothing particularly incredible or groundbreaking. That is my *opinion*. Spare me the downvotes.
As their name suggests, the BoyGenies magically came up with the idea of having multiple songs on an album.
I have to admit I didn't know what was meant by the title.
The line between a 6 song EP and a true record it pretty arbitrary, but for the purposes of these charts, the 2018 EP did not count.
 I just feel like a LOT of indie music lately is the equivalent of made for streaming movies…
It's a supergroup of queer women. All the lesbians and bi women I know have lost their minds over Boygenius. In the week since it dropped, I've hung out with different friends on 3 occasions and someone put the film on and made everyone watch it each time.
Same.
Shame this is likely to get ignored. What an engrossing album, so many different styles and textures being ground up
cumgirl8 will look great in the search history
I hope Who is She play “My ORCA Card” when they open.
fingers crossed they play I'm with Her

Love these guys
The boys are back in town
It’s Wednesday Friday, my dudes.  Turkey Vultures tho
Just saw somebody on RYM call the new Wednesday "bootgaze" lmao. Need this genre to become a thing.
a couple weeks back some bro dumped a humongous 80s/90s CD collection that was BROADLY "goth". the whole 89-99 NIN run (with the remix CDs), the Cure from Pornography -> 2004 s/t, some random wax trax (sister machine gun, thrill kill, KMFDM's nihil), smashing pumpkins, and uhh the cranberries. the wild thing about the collection was that a LOT of these CDs were UK pressings...and my library wasn't gonna add them so they let me buy them for $1 a disc good christ.  anyways now I'm know as "the library clerk that likes CDs and will buy or take them" so I just got pulled over to look through a new box of boomer-ass CDs (thick as a brick was YOINKED as was a Mo-Fi edition of the Moody Blues lol) and some discards. Look, i get why we're discarding Bjork's Utopia, but A LOVE SUPREME 2003 CD REISSUE?! WHAT THE FUCK GUYS!? THATS FUCKING HISTORY. NO NO NO!!  anyways, didn't anticipate I'd wake up with a free library copy of a love supreme today, but even if its a tad scratched I'm just thankful to have saved it from the trash. absolutely bleak to know no one in cataloging is thinking the way i do (i get why these CDs are being weeded but it breaks my heart a bit). also, after seeing it show up in 3 different collections over the past year, I just blankly told cataloging "you need to add tricky's Maxinquaye (& Mezzanine) to the collection" and passed 'em off to the good folks. god willing they add those UK editions of the CD...almost took 'em for myself but hopefully some random 40 year old cornball comes by to rip a copy of maxinquaye and gets woke to Black Steel or Aftermath

Customers occasionally ask me what the CD or radio station playing in the shop is called and I am very mildly offended that it does not occur to them that it's a playlist I have put together myself, spending many many hours doing so.
Listening to Wednesday. It’s good. This band is very good. But I don’t have many thoughts other than that yet, so here’s a different thought. I re-listened to Big Thief’s Masterpiece last night and found myself thinking about how, in retrospect, it’s kinda funny that they’re singing about piss and beer on the title track. They just aren’t really a piss and beer type of band these days
In another exciting installment of "what terrible songs are my coworkers playing," today my was coworker was listening to the world’s shittiest sounding nu metal song that involves the singer repeatedly shouting THEY’RE CANCELLING YOU FOR SOMETHING YOU SAID TEN YEARS AGO
Really packed release day today. My ears are open and the music industry has me right where they want me.
Guitar focus: Wednesday good. Loved those guitar tones. Didn't listen to any singles so when I got to the end of "Bull Believer" I was hootin' and hollerin'.  (Mostly) Non-guitars: Yaeji good. In my opinion, it's a noticeable step-up from *WHAT WE DREW*. Feels like she just felt like experimenting around a bunch of different sounds/ideas/genres, and I felt she pulled most of it off. I was boppin'.  Alright, back to that new Lankum record, which I can now back up that if you liked that Širom record from last year as well as Irish folk, you might like this as well
in this second episode of 'how to be less reductive in describing why Low's album *I Could Live In Hope* is so sad', we will cover... a cover  in episode one, we observed the Low band members become slightly mean in the song *Lazy*, as they sing "Saar-aaah, you're laaaaaa-zeeee...."  for an album built on a foundation of melancholy, this touch of mean-ness magnifies projections of hopelessness and desperation    turning our ears to the song *Sunshine*, a bleak droning cover of "You Are My Sunshine". (editors note:  according to the wiki, You Are My Sunshine was originally published in 1940 by Jimmie Davis and Charles Mitchell.  Jimmie Davis went on to become the governor of the state of Louisiana - twice.  In 1977, the Louisiana legislature adopted You Are My Sunshine as the official song of the state of Louisiana.  The song has been recorded by over 350 artists and translated into 30 languages.)  Low's version of You Are My Sunshine is the muzak that plays in the one way elevator that takes unhappy passengers down to the planes of hell - it's a song that in any other form reignites pleasant memories from infancy and childhood - yet Low strips out every element of fond nostalgia and creates a lifeless dirge, devoid of the chords and keys and tempo that once swathed a place of happiness - and it is riveting.  it underscores the album title *I Could Live In Hope* and the dissonant implication that the artist is engulfed in a state of hopelessness yet somehow still clinging to the smallest sliver of hope
Well Rat Saw Good is excellent as expected. The singles all fit in very well into the whole (though essentially opening with Bull Believer, while certainly a fuckin statement, is a little puzzling - it reads more as a climactic moment and I think it’d really kill as the penultimate track). Will probably take several listens to parse my favorite non-single cuts (all the singles grew on me over time) but Turkey Vultures is an early standout. Bath County continues to be magnificent and my favorite track so far. I adore TV in the Gas Pump as the closer, and weird thing to pull out but I also really love the title of that song (and the relevant lyrical outro). I feel like that image really encapsulates the vibe of the album and the story it’s telling - great sendoff. On another note, I feel like I’m getting something of Masterpiece-era Big Thief here. Like Wednesday def has a distinctive sound, but I hear the threads there in the noisy guitars and the vocal delivery style. Masterpiece has always been my favorite Big Thief album, and given that they’ve moved so far from it sonically I’m really happy to hear some of its influence seep in to the work of another extremely talented and creative band. Anyway, my only minor critique is that the creepy doll on the Bull Believer single cover is sick as hell and should have been the album cover. Happy to see the praise they’re getting, they deserve it!  The other album I was waiting for today is The Worm by HMLTD. I mostly liked West of Eden (and absolutely love a couple of the songs on there) so I was excited to hear they were coming out with a sophomore album. The only single I listened to in advance was Wyrmlands, which I figured might take time to grow on me or maybe would work better in context of the album. Unfortunately that wasn’t really the case, and I found the whole record pretty annoying. It’s as though someone took the “would you still love me if I was a worm” meme and put way too much effort into turning it into a black midi ripoff concept album. No one should want to be Greep this badly, even Greep is barely getting away with it. There are some interesting sonic ideas here and there, mostly hiding in the margins, but the thing felt like a chore to listen to. I’m all for maximalism done right, but here it feels self-indulgent, tiring and unearned. Mikey’s Song and Satan, Luella and I off their first album are certified post-glam bangers, so I’ll probably keep up with this band to see if they course correct, but I don’t think I’ll be coming back to this one.  In conclusion, 🐀>🪱
feeling close to developing the boygenius madlibs template. something like "my partner and i [mundane activity] and then we argued about [classic rock song] so i [different mundane activity, but it plays out in a tragic or unexpected way]"  my partner and i were chowing spaghetti and i said side b of *abbey road* was overrated, we fought so hard i left a red shirt in my whites batch and now all my laundry is pink
I know its entirely my fault for reading the fresh album threads but I am begging yall to stop doing "wow can't wait to get depressed listening to this" cutesy shit, just get a therapist
Wednesday is so good it made me horny
new Tim Hecker is maybe my favorite thing he's made since *Love Streams*, a supremely underrated album that got fucked over majorly by a super early leak and 4AD just giving up on marketing it & then dropping him from the label because of said leak & lack of marketing
Smog : Knock Knock  It’s funny to notice how Callahan’s voice was much higher than now.
The crowd for Duster sure has changed the past few years. I went from one of the younger people to one of the oldest.
* Got myself some tickets to see Melody's Echo Chamber. Fuck yea. * Ended up listening to [*Liquid Swords*](https://www.discogs.com/master/25167-Genius-GZA-Liquid-Swords) (as the Wu-Tang show finished this week) and - not a new idea here - what a fantastic album. * Went through both [*Brown Sugar*](https://www.discogs.com/master/151760-DAngelo-Brown-Sugar) and [*Voodoo*](https://www.discogs.com/master/151766-DAngelo-Voodoo) as well. *Voodoo* was such a fun experience.
**Fishmans Fry V**  Well, it's almost Easter, which means it's time to bring the Fishmans Fry to a close.  *98.12.28 Otokotachi no Wakare* is the last more-or-less major Fishmans release, a live show recorded months before the passing of Shinji Sato.  It's...pretty good!  A little heavy on the dub stuff, but Fishmans was heavy on the dub stuff in general, so this is hardly a complaint.  There's a little for everyone here--most,if not all, of their albums have a spot here, and they're pretty good spots--including a longer "Season."  I don't think *Long Season* really benefits much from another six minutes but it's nice to have.  Anyway.  I have had fun.  In lieu of a ranking let me just say that if I could do this over I probably would have gone *King Master George - Orange - Kuchu Camp - Long Season - 98.12.28,* throwing in "Season" in week 2 and "Yurameki in the Air" (another non-album single, which does also appear on the live album) in week 3.  I liked this overall, though!  And I've listened to *Long Season!*    Time to turn off the fryers, though.  Thanks for coming along, those that came along.
Wednesday, FACS, Yaeji, North Americans, what a day.  Anyhow I've come to make an announcement.  Next week **the National Park Service** is doing a rerelease of their 2019 record [*Room for Love*](https://lilytapesanddiscs.bandcamp.com/album/room-for-love)--it's the first physical issue, on cassette, courtesy of Lily Tapes and Discs.  LTD and NPS put out a record last year, too, and I can attest the tapes are very nice.  As for *Room for Love,* I really, really love it--instrumental electric folk with shades of drone and early, early post rock.  A powerfully tender piece of work.  It was a constant during the weird days of the pandemic, and it fits perfectly into this new spring we got going on.  This is peak Tadcore right here.  It is Bandcamp Friday, is all.  Consider it.
If you get the chance, go see Xiu Xiu. It was one of the most intense shows I've been to.
Alright ya'll convinced me to try out Wednesday and I'm a fan on first listen. Reminds me a bit of Great Grandpa
New Wednesday and George Clanton single I’m VIBRATING.
It's not that Bay of Pigs doesn't fit in well enough with the rest of Kaputt, but it does make sense that it was a standalone single before Kaputt. It does somewhat stand out without the sax or trumpet that's on so many tracks and feels a bit more electronic and modern, not as '80s as the rest of the album

wednesday & fire-toolz real good
I've been finally getting into Irish folk, after really enjoying the new Lankum album... It's about time I gave my own culture a real try! Any fans here?  My favourite so far has been the s/t album from Andy Irvine and Paul Brady. I would highly recommend it to any folk fans out there, especially if you like folk with a sort of mediaeval bard vibe!
getting zooted after a work week ends on your couch and listening to some mazzy star is a pinnacle experience
My boyfriend's gonna see his first Cure show from the SIXTH row!!!!!!!!
Any love for “Mr. Fantasy” by Traffic? It’s such a weird hodge podge of psychedelia mixed with quirky English music hall, but then random moments of blues rock and Spanish style guitar work. But somehow it all works. And quite well too by my estimation.
any good disco or generally just groovy indie stuff? I love of Montreal, Donny Benet, and Shintaro Sakamoto
Today's listening so far:  Started with my spotify FOLK/ACOUSTIC mix to ease into the day. The algorithm is not spectacular of course, but an enjoyable start to the day nonetheless   Then, Wednesday. I like it. I like them. I do not like off key squealing at the end of Bull Believer at all. But all in all, good stuff.  Blondeshell - I was surprised how much I liked this one. I think I'm gonna fall in love it  Jana Horn - seemed like it was gonna be up my alley from the reviews I saw, but for all the hype about her songwriting in said reviews- I thought it was pretty bland  Ekkstacy- Negative...mini album/ ep from 2021. Can't remember where I came across this one, but I like it. It reminds of the 1st Drums record if it was more serious and less campy...  Tugboat Annie - this is some old school shit from the Boston scene that sounds like it could be made now. I was due for a re listen and it did not disappoint
was really scared of wednesday signing to dead oceans because i figured they'd want to smooth out their sound too much but maybe they're the only good dead oceans band? i still think the dirty tape mix on the covers album is the best that band is gonna sound, but it turns out the whole country shoegaze thing scales up PERFECTLY. god, what a fucking album! big guitars! rock music! great lyrics about the south and random bullshit! really, really loved it on a first listen. this is the kind thing we need in big ticket indie. they might be saving the whole thing
Seems like I decided to release my [new album](https://interbellum.bandcamp.com/album/our-house-is-very-beautiful-at-night) on the biggest busiest release day :D   Still, I'm excited! It's my first record in, shit, 5 years.   If you're into noisy folk rock, give it a spin :)   (think The Microphones, Sparklehorse, Grouper)
Trying to determine how much I really need to spend on Good Bandcamp Friday...
Been getting back into heavier music and The Chariot - *One Wing* is one of the best and most intense albums I've ever heard. Just an absolute ride from beginning to end. Christian mathcore 4eva

It might be the oversaturation of Phoebe Bridgers that I found myself kind of silently rooting against the new Boygenius album for whatever reason. But jeezus, I'm firmly in the "it's great top to bottom" camp. What a fantastic album that has already brought me to tears multiple times.  I'm sorry I ever doubted these people!

This fire-toolz album sounds like black metal vocals over a mix of vaporwave and Wii music but it kinda slaps?
Can't believe i'm seeing Karate live in about two months. This tiny but super influential and amazing band that pretty much nobody gave a fuck for a bajilion years is coming to Portugal, because apparently The Numero Group reissues have that power nowadays. I swear, sometimes everything seems like absolutely dogshit but sometimes I realise stuff like that and it lights me up for the 3 and a half seconds that I manage to rationalise it away from all the capitalist implications of such a phenomenon etc. etc. tldr bands good.  EDIT: Also, Bush (the band) deserves better cred. Those first 4 albums range from milquetoast good to great. The epitome of a rate 6.
I've been listening to a lot of Elton John after reading his autobiography and I find it weird how, for all his huge sales and accolades over the years, he's just not been picked up on by younger rock audiences in the same way a lot of his contemporaries have. He's very, very popular, sure, but I don't know nearly as many people who know his work as I do other artists of his era.
Hi, I’m new here so sorry if I get it all wrong. I’m trying to find a place where I can discuss the music I like which is Indie Rock and Pop. I write a blog where I post what I like with links and playlists (not for profit) but I’m struggling to interact with others. I just love music and want to share it with others and find out new bands I’ve never heard of. Is this the right place to do this? Can I share my blog for others to read/listen to? If not, where can I make music friends?
ok wtf, WHY ON EARTH is T-Pains cover of War Pigs excellent?!
these two girls who were doing nice indie covers on Youtube for a while released their first song and it's better than it has any right to be  I'll get to the Wednesday when it's actually Wednesday! I honestly can't believe how y'all are already listening to it. Need I remind you, that today IS FRIDAY?! Do names mean nothing anymore?!
Referring to that comment about people trying to relate to music too hard, who be hooping or working out and listening to some Angel Olsen or Weyes Blood
New surprise release from Sleep Research Facility got me more giddy than any other release the past 2 years
I was listening to the Ex Hex album It's Real today and it occurred to me that I think Mary Timony was writing a tribute album to her favorite bands?  Sometimes it's a riff, a lyric, or the sound of her voice/harmony that makes me think of other bands.  For example:  2. Rainbow Shiner - just reminds me of Pat Benatar  3. Good Times - The Cars, obviously  5. Diamond Drive - Just has the coolness factor of Chrissie Hynd of the Pretenders  8. Cosmic Cave - The Go-Go's  Can anyone else fill out some other tracks and their influences?    4. Want it to be true and 10. Talk to Me have distinctive sounds... thoughts?
The run from “Chosen to Deserve” through “Turkey Vultures” blew my mind a bit. Like, I knew this band was good but I didn’t know they were this good

I love broadly "goth"  Also yeah wtf it's A Love Supreme!  When I was in middle school I talked about music with one of the custodians sometimes, he recommended Thick As a Brick and I listened to it but never got into it
Bless you. When Spotify first got big, I can't tell you how many times I'd be in a shop/café/bar and a song I love would come on and I'd  run up to the person and excitedly tell them I love Arthur Russell too, only to have them stare back blankly and say "oh, I don't know who that is, that's just Spotify"

Ok but I never realized how much I did this until now because sometimes I’m just embarrassed of telling people that it’s my playlist ever since I had a weird condescending customer who asked me what “new wave station” I was playing once when it was just Beach House :/
math rocks next song will have piss and beer lyrics   *i wanna drink piss and beer*  *watch the bucks and fear the deer*  *no fucks given for my career*  *im a poorly fed duck down by the pier*  order now!
i bet a large factor into the disappearance of "piss and beer" in the big thief universe is bc of the divorce, you know? *ufof* is the first post-divorce album and i think that really shows whereas the earlier stuff is more grounded piss and beer type lyrics

we took baths and listened to your dads records   i said I didnt much care for The Doors  you'd put on your towel and said you were bored  left me wet and crying on the floor
Incredible. Thank you for this
We all need to be less capital R Relatable I feel
I'm more of a 'I can't wait to frolic through an open field while listening to this' guy, no matter the album's tone.
once i see comments like that i know the album sucks lmao
"can't wait to listen to this" comments in general are so pointless. Like yeah most people in the thread are gonna listen to it, you don't have to tell us.

I still haven't listened to boygenius in part because of that lol.
>just get a therapist  for sure, for sure, but, and hear me out first ... money
not again
gonna listen to this in like 6 months...the lack of kranky getting their titles into record shops or libraries and also saying "this is now $18 ahahahha" hasn't exactly made me efficient at checking recent stuff  but i HAVE been revisiting Virgins & finally taking in Ravedeath, 1972. Hecker just doesn't miss (harmony is my favorite bc its the first one i heard) and its been nice to revisit these with different, more enhanced ears. Virgins' editing and pacing imo was such a significant leap for his work
i do think *love streams* got weirdly fucked over by 4ad, i also really loved *konoyo* though...  anyways the new one on first contact sorta felt like a return to the glassier/cleaner synthetic textures that complimented the vocal experiments of *love streams* but applied to dronier compositions this time around? yet it still some acoustic instruments in the mix too. definitely lots to take in on this one but im excited to spend more time with it
Im a major (I mean *major*)Konoyo fan so this was likely never going to match up but it was still a really good listen (seriously this man knows his sounds).      It's sounds like Haunt Me got a Ghosts V software update. Cold and glacial but bigger? encompassing? Cinematic. I think his soundtrack work that he's been doing lately really shows on here (Especially The North Water). No Highs comes across as a synthesis of all the styles Hecker's been playing around with cause when listening there are points where I go " oh that's so ravedeath, oh that's so north water etc" but instead of the push/pull of electronic and natural sounds on his other work, on No Highs he's really reeling everything in and making a Tim Hecker record. Which in Tim's case is by no means a bad thing and arguably actually a very good thing.      Personal highlights are Winter Cop and Monotony ll for sure but like I said I will be happily sitting with this record despite Winter being mostly over where I am.
And it was even higher before. He's had like 3 voices
It was such a surreal experience when I went the other night. The zoomers were going HARD for Inside Out like it was a banger and not their most depressing song. However I don't want to complain too much because it was fun and I'd much prefer that to people standing still / acting bored
I see you link to last.fm instead of Discogs now?
tad can we turn on the air fryer so you can run through the Air catalog real quick
IM SO EXCITED !!!
Any other bands with mundane names that sound like this?
d) don't
admittedly I am not from Chicago but simply who the fuck is chilling their malort
barkbark im like the only person here who actually fucks with the taste of malort and even I know to only have like 1 shot of it every 3-4 months! (last shot was in february at Drowse...it was a u/thebigscratch situtation where the DJ bought me and a few others a free shot. i was THRILLED)  anyways i take my malort shots chilled in a fridge straight from the bottle; no clue wtf kind of drinks you would like with it. to keep this music related I'll also point out that throughout the recorded Steely Dan catalog, the lyrics never mention any beverages made with malort. but also i can't recall a steely dan cut that discusses chartreuse or campari, the beverages I sort of turn to most in these circumstances.
since i lived in chicago for like a decade; at this point i've probably had 7 shots of malort in my life and it has always been cuz of a stupid dare. i'm sure there are people out there who enjoy it at home & such but i cannot tell you the "right" way to drink it 😭 I've probably gotten a bit desensitized to how much it sucks but also don't think I'd go out of my way to casually savor it
It is best drunk nervously in front of people who seem like they are able to handle it way better than you've been able to
I remember a St Patty's day maybe 10 years ago where my friends and I were pouring it into a gutter on the roof of a garage and then drinking it when it poured out through a hole in the gutter.  Peak degeneracy. Surprised we are all still alive.
d) after you've had like 5 beers and the guy you sort of know who "actually loves malort" buys shots for everyone so you go along with it and hey that wasn't so b-*oh my god*
Me and my friends live in Chicago and drink Malort all the time (in fact we all had handshakes on Wednesday night!). We take straight shots straight from the bottle at room temp
> fire-toolz  yes! fire-toolz is pretty good! i think the overall flow and structure of the album isn't quite as immersive as *eternal home* was (still room for it to grow on me though) but there's some great moments and i like how relatively ambient the back half gets. some of those feel like maybe the closest she's gotten to fusing the fire-toolz and nonlocal forecast aesthetics into one
I don't have recs but you just reminded me that [this version of Arthur McBride](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBGkhPx529g) exists and now I have to go listen to it about a dozen times
Junior Brother put out Pull The Right Rope in 2019 and I quite liked that album. Especially [The Back of Her.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Bk6iKdDfQ)
have you heard Mary O'Hara's Songs of Ireland. really gorgeous album
boom headshot
Hope he enjoys! They're so so so so so so good live.
That is a great seat congrats to him.
I'm more of a [*The Low Spark Of High Heeled Boys*](https://www.discogs.com/master/69040-Traffic-The-Low-Spark-Of-High-Heeled-Boys) fan buuuuuuut *Mr. Fantasy* is a good one too.
Traffic totally whips ass (even though they sometimes use the flute, a bad instrument IMO) and it would have been sick if the Grateful Dead had covered more of their songs outside of “Mr. Fantasy.”    “Glad” is a quintessential Friday afternoon tune
Traffic is a fantastic band.  Lots of great songs (and duds, too, to be fair.)  One of my enduring favorites as a long time fan is "Who Knows What Tomorrow May Bring."    Fun fact:  Traffic and Can had the same bass player for a time (not the *same* time)
Obligatory The Avalanches/LCD Soundsystem/Daft Punk mention  Some other stuff you might like:  - Róisín Murphy -  Róisín Machine - Gang Gang Dance - Eye Contact - Magdalena Bay -  A Little Rhythm and a Wicked Feeling - Everything Everything - Get to Heaven - Jessie Ware - What's Your Pleasure - Toro y Moi -  Outer Peace (not a fan favorite, but very groovy) - Janelle Monáe - The ArchAndroid - U.S. Girls - In a Poem Unlimited  and if your're cool with instrumental/electronic music:   - Jamie XX - in Colour - DJ Sabrina the Teenage DJ - Charmed - Against all Logic - 2012 - 2017

Parcels's first record is such a delight, especially if you like Donny Benet. Very 70s inspired electrodiscoindie.
want to collaborate on my new piece, "How Wednesday is Saving Indie Rock" i love indie rock again
>i still think the dirty tape mix on the covers album is the best that band is gonna sound  have you listened to the gutterin ep? cause ya need to listen to the guttering ep
this makes me want to write into the indiecast mailbag again
>the only good dead oceans band  😠
> maybe they're the only good dead oceans band  Shame are right there though
ah that's so cool! gonna take a listen now. do you know any other Christian mathcore type stuff?
I never knew there was Christian mathcore or it would even be good but I will have to check it out.
yeah this is what angel has been doing for like 7 years
I mean, if you're gonna just come 'round and drop your blog, it will not go especially well.  You must become as one of us.  Pick a flair, pick a few favorites, pick fights.  Comment on a Hype Thursday post.  Make [FRESH] posts on the front page.  Do a rate, maybe.  We like to hang out but we *will* want to be sure you're, like, cool first.    anyway donna's gonna come around in a little bit and ask you what your favorite Coldplay record is so just be ready for that
hello eavesdropUK, one of my fav uk bands is coldplay. what's your fav coldplay song and/or fav coldplay album?
Don't worry about it. I barely interact with the things going on on this sub, except for the DMDs and GDs.  People get weird around here when it comes to self-promotion but seem happy to support when it's someone they know. So, idk.   Otherwise there aren't really any rules in DMD. You just say stuff about music, like "Weezer > The Strokes" and watch mayhem ensue.
You can share it, but you would probably get more interaction/music friends if you copy the text into a comment in here as opposed to just sharing the link
Because T-Pain is very talented and “War Pigs” is very good
Imagine an alternate universe where on a Thursday On a Friday released new music.
We're all two days late and just trying really hard to catch up.
This list is clutch and is like .85:1 w my interpretation of bootgaze—stumbled on it a few months ago and was happy to recognize that a fellow pedal steel-inclined DMD regular had put it together
BANGER list  i guess tarnation (another 4AD remember some guys) act could go here too? Stars on ESP isn't bootgaze but also I just recommend that one for everyone to listen  also i guess the ONE big thief shoegaze ditty should be here too
I know and love all the predecessors minus Acetone and Lift to Experience. Excited to check these out.
Such an excellent description. TIL I'm a bootgaze fan and didn't even know it.
there's something so raw and personal about being able to see someone's record collection in boxes and immediately note the major collections they held and try to imagine SOMETHING about them. this person CARED about their CDs enough to get UK editions. they also gave away their stone roses' Turn Into Stone comp & second coming (but not the debut?). the paths taken and the years of love...  the collection itself was very similar to another one i'd seen a few months prior (included the smiths, limp bizkit, public enemy, oingo boingo, breeders' Pod)
>  only to have them stare back blankly and say "oh, I don't know who that is, that's just Spotify"  Man... So many bad memories of this. This is why I've stopped trying to talk to people working in shops when they're playing great music. Most of the time it's just someone else's random playlist and it ends up just being an awkward interaction
Can it be a different team I don’t like the Bucks
big big thief does not want you to know that these two wackjobs were married!  but seriously how is that not a point in the opening paragraph of every article about them lol
I know you jest but the timeline does sorta line up lol. I think Two Hands is a bit “piss and beer-y” at times, at least in sound but yeah Capacity is the last really grounded one
Fuck, that's it
wow, your partner sounds really smart. RIP to a real one
wait this isnt how madlibs works i changed too much lemme do it agian
It's pretty bad in the indie world but in the more mainstream alt and even pop worlds: mental health awareness was a mistake
man sometimes i wonder how people even relate to these Relatable Artists. lucy dacus writes such specific "i did this, then you did this, i felt like this, then this happened" lyrics that they feel totally unrelatable
Listening to artists with a different experiences from you can be good! How fucking boring and narrow my music listening experience would be if I only listened to shit I related to.
Out w capital-R Relatable, in with capital-R Romantic
I can't wait to frolic through an open field while listening to A Crow Looked At Me
I wish there were more fields for frolicking near me. It's hard to find a good one when you're surrounded by stroads and car-dependent infrastructure without going for a long drive
someone posted that shit on the Tim Hecker album and I just deflated
Can’t wait to get depressed listening to Liturgy
shit like that wasnt why i stopped listening to Mitski but its a large part of why i havent returned to her.  i think i just dont like hype in general and i'd count droves of people saying "omg relatable" about something as hype.
can't wait to read this comment
I mean you're not wrong, but "comments in general are so pointless" isn't wrong either, so who cares. It's okay for people to be excited about shit and not have much else to say.
I fucking love this shit. "DEVIL'S ADVOCATE", "IDEAS PERSON" all in his fruity lil euro accent, thank you mark
YES HAHA YES
YES GET RAVEDEATH PILLED WANE  DROP A PIANO   GET IN THE FOG  AND IN THE AIR  THREE TIMES EACH  DEVELOP A HATRED OF MUSIC  TWICE
legend has it Bill's voice will only continue along this trajectory until he sings an octave so low it rumbles the earth to such an extent it spurs a chain reaction of events leading to the end of the world
Yeah, I wasn’t expecting that reaction to some of the songs. But you’re right, I’d rather have that then bored people.
Discogs was down earlier when I posted - though it's working now and I've updated the links.
I gotta come up with a new pun.  Maybe.
but I bought a bottle    just googled "what is the best way to drink Malort?" and got:    *First brewed as a digestif during the Middle Ages, the wormwood in Malort supposedly will kill stomach parasites, which, if you've tasted Malort, should not surprise you.*    what have I done
this strikes me as potentially being directionally incorrect paj    you wouldn't deceive a fellow mspaint fan would you?
i heard dan was really inspired by u2 and is gonna re-record his hits with new lyrics. "deacon blues" is now "drink campari all night long, and die behind the wheel"
Fellow malort fan here. Just had a handshake on Wednesday night with the homies
at long last a straight up answer in an ocean of room temperature takes!  I see there are some cocktail recipes on the interwebs involving grapefruit juice, radler, tonic water, etc... time to start experimentin'
update:  just had first shot of room temp Malort (barrel aged) and now I too actually fuck with the taste of Malort.  bitter liquors ftw!  full report in DMD tomorrow
7 shots in 10 years is about 1.05 fluid ounces per year    at this rate, it will take 24.2 years to finish this 750ml bottle
thankful you are still here to talk about it nicodroz!
omg this is great.  paj street cred healed to 100%.  will look up handshake recipe, thx charm!
yea my thoughts are probably the same. it is very all over the place but i pretty much listen to fire-toolz for that reason. Like I appreciate that ambient synth+acoustic guitar+guitar solo at the beginning of the third track before it sounds like ur being jacked out of some pleasant world with glitchy noises. Then there are like glitchy pop vocal parts and later the Great Allower goes full Pupil Slicer
Fantastic stuff! Glad I could help haha
I actually tried that this week - really good album!
I listened to it once a long time ago. Listening again now... I should be more receptive to it this time!
Will gladly investigate this! Idk much else by them aside from their standalone singles and “Feelin Alright”.
How can you just be anti-flute??
This list rocks
> Everything Everything - Get to Heaven  YES
it really is so nice to have a big ticket indie band i can actually root for
no what is that
I like the line "we watched a phish concert and human centipede / two things I now wish I had never seen"
they never responded to my essay
toro y moi is a good band but mahal sucked. i can include them too if that makes you feel better
i’m aware
Sadly not!
[here is my blog](https://pitchfork.com)
>Pick a flair, pick a few favorites, pick fights.  Comment on a Hype Thursday post.  Make \[FRESH\] posts on the front page.  Do a rate, maybe  wow, I do none of these and I've been here since 2018 😄  oh no, wait. yeah, no, I do pick fights. But I only pick the ones I know I'll lose.
Tad have I been around long enough to drop my blog
Hi Donna, thank you for asking. Unfortunately I am not a Coldplay fan so not able to pick any favourites. There’s a new track by Apollo Junction that I’ve been enjoying today called History.  Have you heard it?
Thanks. I’m really just trying to share music I love rather than myself so hopefully that will show through. Your comment reminded me of a track that came out today by Django Jones and the Mystery Men - Date night at Joey’s. Have you heard it?
Weezer = Strokes   I’ve never seen them in the same room
I will check these out and probably add them to the list! I trust your judgment  Edit: added *Gentle Creatures* by Tarnation to the list, it fits right in next to Emmylou Harris
idk the first iteration of “this world is not my home” on *stars on esp* is kinda bootgaze, it’s an argument i would accept at least
Hope you like em! Acetone in particular has influenced pretty much every band in this 'scene' and have become one of my favorite 90s bands since I discovered them
no sorry its the only thing that rhymes with deer
Get this:  Jack and Meg White (from The White Stripes) used to be *married*
yea, it's really out of character that the music press is just like "we're gonna respect their privacy on this one"
Damn I had no idea
I feel like anyone who had read the 2017 NPR piece that read like a fucking fairy tale story could have deduced this
Notably the piss and beer songs on Two Hands (which are the best on the album) were written before UFOF came out
> Years ago Ronnie got charged with simple assault and aggravated assault from throwing mic stands into the crowd. Years later he makes a song about cancel culture and with zombies in it. And he proceeds to kill a zombie with a mic stand. Incredible.  im foaming at the mouth
They died of "badtasteitis" :(
> my partner and i went to therapy together and then we argued about the merits of Jello's use of the N word in *Holiday in Cambodia* so i created a twitter thread where i cancelled you but then the world cancelled me
it's not how it works but you did good anyway
you did good, thanks for both
But how will people know that I’m a good person if I don’t preach to my fans about mental health awareness
Having depression is cool, find a new slant
I think it’s more of “I relate to the emotional stakes of this song” and less “I too also think Leonard Cohen was really horny” or whatever, but yeah
Crows = Nature = Perfect for open fields
ok now I’m REALLY confused
Remember folks, dr tim hecker PHD does NOT have a doctorate in therapy he will NOT fix you.   he has a doctorate in sound or some shit; he will teach you about the power dynamics of white noise or something
every time I hear that lady go WAAAAHH AHHHHH AHHHH I cry
the maximalist instrumentations and shrill shrieks are the sum total of my inner enigmas personified on the fast rivers of time flowing through gods veins
My mom always said if you don't have anything interesting to say don't comment are slash Indieheads on Reddit dot com
no that is wrong, comments are good sometimes
He will quake.
good series though! nothing too crazy this time around, but I liked when you talked to your friend about fishmans! that was the highlight imo
bro why did you buy a bottle of malort for home consumption
Malort is like if Jager stole copper from job sites.
oh rock on
lfg rock on sir
lfg lfg lfg!  > full report in DMD tomorrow  *GD! Saturday in the GD!
A Chicago handshake is a shot of malort and an old style beer. Not much of a recipe haha But this combo usually costs like $5-6 at the bar
I'm more of a Paper Sun fan buuuut Mr. Fantasy and The Low Spark of High Heeled Boys also bangers
Idk, it’s just not for me.  Respect the talent behind it yada yada but it’s not a sound I ever seek out.  It doesn’t always ruin a song for me but it definitely can.    I’m open to change, feel free to throw something up to change my mind—“Universal Applicant” doesn’t count
me too. i wore my wednesday mortal combatish dragon shirt to teach today
pre-twin plagues collab tape from wednesday x mj lenderman  they also did one before that (believe it was their first musical collaboration) called How Do You Let Love Into the Heart That Isn't Split Wide Open, but that one is more ambient/noise. they followed that up with an ambient side project called nash to stoudemire (album is called faucet).  both are essential releases in their catalogues imo. guttering is still my favorite thing either has done.
of all the bands you could've included ...
:(
Yeah, you're in the clear.
i have not heard it tbh, i mostly just listen to coldplay trakcs tbh
So like, The Scientist? Or more like Yellow?
[Me, reading this comment.](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/0a/44/14/0a4414e93ddb908fbe6eefb8b5e18ddd.gif)
i have a giant wall of text written up for Stars on ESP i should bring out tomorrow for the DMD...only heard Livonia just last year and then Stars on ESP in February and was going APESHIT at the pop perfection. couldn't believe that such an album was realized with such grace and quirk
and also fucks
I was reading Jack White's Wikipedia article yesterday, interesting stuff. The "Personal Life" section is lengthy and includes a subsection for "Eccentricity"
i don’t like it when y’all try to trick me :(
hey real quick take a wild guess as to whether or not i have read that specific piece from 6 years ago and/or if i would remember it if i had
yes much better i love the mundane
if you cancel the abyss, the abyss cancels back at you :-(
the "we" is you and me :)   >!not really. this is a weird comment and i apologize if i have over stepped my bounds and made you uncomfortable. stay cool king!<
have you considered revolutionizing their perception of bodies and spaces
what the fuck is this boygenius album about actually
i personally always got more "m'lady *fedora tip*" vibes from Leonard
As a 'Death of a Ladies Man' lover I'll say the world needed more horny Leonard Cohen.
to help all my friends win the war against their stomach parasites
golly I thought about this... there's a music crossover coming!  thx for patience here mods...   okay here's a [video of the Flaming Lips trying Malort!](https://youtu.be/2XqITJEUrks)
empty bottle im assuming? they've always go the two at least
Well I don't see how I can just make you like a sound. But yeah its use on Dream River came to mind actually. It's pretty sick on Astral Weeks too
😂
Ok great   It’s FuckYeahAllAmericanRejects.tumblr.com  I share all my opinions and thoughts about the best band out of Stillwater Oklahoma.   You can learn how I feel about their many hit songs such as “Move Along” and “Dirty Little Secret”   And here’s my dirty little secret ;) you might see some pictures and fan appreciation posts too!
Not sure what this gif is of but it's hilarious.
yeah it’s incredible, so many perfect pop songs, “the bees” in particular is one of the most sublime lil songs i know. the two records between livonia and esp are great, on the spectrum of dark spooky experimental atmospheric stuff that livonia hits to that quirky pop perfection of esp, each of those two in between is about an equal-sized step from livonia’s end to esp’s. and then ft. lake after stars on esp is… awful lol that shit tragically lost me completely and i kinda jump off the band there. but what a run!
no no it's true! jack white wrote a huge list of rules for making a successful band and one of the final rules was "be married to your drummer for a period of time but then make music together."  google "jack white rule 34" for more info!
for someone who loves to bitch about big thief in the dmd and get on their soapbox about it, lowkey yeah man!
help!! I've been cancelled!!!*  ^(*no one liked my provacative tweet and now i feel ashamed)
no it’s fine you implied that we bathed together but didn’t explicitly say it so I think it’s ok
It’s exclusively about how horny Leonard Cohen was, don’t let anyone tell you otherwise
social media engagement
haha yep, I’ve had plenty of handshakes at the bottle. My favorite Chicago venue
*Dream River* is a huge exception as it’s far and away my favorite Bill album.  I also dig *Astral Weeks*, maybe I’m just not a fan of proggy flute and/or I’m a man of inconsistencies
> FuckYeahAllAmericanRejects.tumblr.com  Wait, there's an actual blog here.
I wake up every evening with a big smile on my face :D
It's of me realizing that Weezer and the Strokes have never been in the same room - duuuuuh.
def a catalog i will be filling in the blanks with (a lot of the releases are all quirky and have different masters n' different track lists) slowly. I want His Name is Alive on tape and get real particular with these things (ESP is a cd album perfect enough! got it for $3 in lubbock, tx back at christmas). but truly an artist i've found a deep admiration with
i dont read about my enemies I just vibe
The last time I was outraged by someone not liking an instrument it was the organ. How do you feel about organs?
Yeah are you surprised????  >!circa 2012 you could type “fuckyeah(any band).tumblr.com” and stumble into a fan blog!<
Huge fan, never upset to hear it.  Hammond B3 is maybe my favorite (conventional rock) sound that isn’t guitar/bass/drum/traditional piano if we’re excluding pedal steel guitar.
Fish
bless beth
good band
God, i love this band. I think Liz has some of the best lyrics going, and I adore Jonathans solos. I think the one from I told you that I was afraid has replaced the solo from Whatever as my favourite.
The problem with the Beths is their songs sound too fun and too well-crafted that casual listeners don’t notice the brilliantly insightful lyrics in every single fucking song.
The songs rightfully get first billing, but holy shit, those chops. They play the hell out of those instruments.
Larry
Fish!!
The Beths are named after the first name of the singer (Eliza**beth**)
These dudes are so underrated. Always love to bask in their sound
Oh hell yeah, I had no idea this was coming. I really enjoyed Roped In and loving this so far. So relaxing.
I think they’re from England
Absolutely. I couldn't quantify just how many hours I have spent listening to their last two LPs, and I am positive this one will be no different.
KEXP's been on a roll this week.
This song is so fucking good
I am happy they are getting the praise they deserve. I sure hope it translates into money for them. And more albums for us.  I was a little disappointed that they didn’t play any unreleased songs the 2 times over the last four years that I saw them. There’s nothing better than hearing a band you love play you a song for the first time from a stage.   I accept that it might be part of their creative process to write/record/release first. Or I was unlucky. And I realize I’ll never be satisfied with the amount of The Beths songs on Earth.
The meaning behind this song is so fucking relatable.   The song didn’t quite hit for me on the first couple listens. But boy did it come around full circle for me. It’s catchy af.
Forget Boygenius, this is the goods right here
The guitarist looks so much like Terry Gilliam it's shocking
Saw them with Bad Bad Hats a few years ago and it was such an awesome show all around
will this song ever not make me cry?
Cool Dear Nora t!
Saw them live in San Francisco, Sydney Gish toured with them as their opener, both artists are incredible. I’m biased toward Gish, but The Beths were super fun live and have sprinkled in to some of my playlists now
This song feels strangely nostalgic yet fresh. Whenever i hear it, it transports me to a smiley, fluffy place.
best indie rock album of 2022 imo!! love the beths
Love the Beths, and this is a solid and refreshing performance.
They're milking this song for all its worth.
Don’t know why people compare this band to Alvvays though
They played Silence Is Golden well before release when I saw them in February 2022! Sorry you haven't been as lucky :(
It sounds like you haven't seen them live early enough in the album cycle. I saw them play Silence is Golden, Watching the Credits and When You Know You Know before the album came out.  EDIT: Technically When You Know You Know was already released, as a demo version was released on the demos cassette.
I was a big boygenius fan (still am all things considered). This album is so much better
The band? That is literally what bands do. Play their songs to anyone who’ll let them/pay them to do so.
This your first album rollout? Wouldn't call promoting the lead single as "milking" it.
I mean the song fucking rules so they can milk it as much as they want as far as I'm concerned.
Because it’s awesome?
It's a live in-studio, generally speaking you play the lead single off your latest album on those at bare minimum. What were you expecting?
reddit users when a band plays one of their songs
why do you bring this up so often lol, also no one is comparing them here
First time I've ever seen someone say this.
I’m sure that’s right about the timing. And my sample of 2 shows over 4 years is pretty meaningless.   At the set I saw recently, about half way into the show a fan shouted out sweetly “Please play us a new one.” The audience cheered and you heard a few more shout please. It was all very nice.  So I thought it was a done deal that we’d hear something that hadn’t made it Spotify before the night ended.   Stokes said “A new one?…. Uhm…..sorry.”   She and her drummer looked at each other like 🤷🏼and they got back to the set list.
If it's not a new song every time it's derivative shit.
I was expecting three Ace of Base covers (deep tracks only) and an unreleased song that Liz wrote in 1st grade.
It's a case of "putting the idea in your head" under the guise of lambasting it.
Man, you're getting dog-piled for not having an "/s" but I thought your joke was obvious.
I’m a huge Alvvays fan so when you every enter “who else kinda sounds like Alvvays” people bring up the Beth’s. But yeah, sure, what you said
It's possible it's just a derivative joke! :)
Pavement vibes off the charts on this one. AOTY for me, and truly one of the best bands around right now!
My favorite song besides bull believer off the album and love this video. So fun and creative I smiled big when they’re in the car. Can’t wait to se them live!
what a bop
Waterloo sunset.
Love the MJ Lenderman stuff and the music is good for this band, but I cannot take this singer's voice seriously.

Her voice seems to be divisive. Her voice is one of the reasons I really enjoy the band.
Booooooooo
For real….she sounds like a dying cat

a taiwanese band? here? in r/indieheads?
Oh nice I liked the 2016 album looks like they have an album coming in May.
the best indie rock band in taiwan imo
I've tried to find a vinyl release of their stuff somewhere, no dice. Great band. Slick production, not too slick. Vocals are my favorite part probably, the sweet singing when they get that hard edge, so good. And they don't overdue it, just enough to keep you listening on repeat to your favorite song by them. Hope they come to the states at some point soon.

really looking forward to this album in the mail. recent shows were brilliant
Yes, he is excellent live!  I saw his "comeback" show opening for The National in Hamilton, Ontario in 2019. It was the first time I had seen him since the early 2000's and he was great. I'm glad that he is back.
Haven't listened to Ruston in awhile. Halfway through my first listen. Enjoying this so far! Seeing this release today was a pleasant surprise, was unaware he had new music coming.
Really enjoying this so far. St. Jupiter, Breakdown, and (especially) Holy Shit are my favorite songs so far.
Love me some Ruston. I don't think it quite stacks up to Dying Star or Shape and Destroy, but it's still a great listen.
Arthur Russell is always a pleasure. Just kind of seems like they're scraping the bottom of the barrel at this point.

I don’t mind  Release a record full of Arthur Russell’s farts with cello and I’d still buy it
You could probably say this about Lou Reed, granted he reaches a much larger audience. I found his last release of demos very insightful, despite being barebones and perhaps a cash grab.   What did you think of Iowa dream? Man was prolific and I’m not discounting any demos until I’ve heard them.
>What did you think of Iowa dream?  Loved it! Probably my favorite of his posthumous records (wasn't a big fan of *Love Is Overtaking Me* on the other hand). Has one of my favorite Russell songs with *You Did It Yourself*.  So yes, I hear you. I guess it's just that previous records were arranged in a way that they worked as full bodies of work similar to those he released in his lifetime. This having only 9 songs took me by surprise I guess. But we'll see.
Iowa dream was a really wonderful experience for me. I've been a huge fan of Arthur for eons, and I thought I'd hear it all, but I fell in love with his music all over again as soon as I heard 'Barefoot in New York'. It was such a delight to be surprised again after so long. I hope it happens again
That song is so unique. The arrangement, unorthodox rhythms, and his stuttering take on spoken word (enhanced by the background vocalists) are stunning.   The fourth wall break in the last verse is vulnerable and honest, even by Arthur Russell’s standards lol. It’s like he’s inviting you to rewind and truly listen to the lyrics. Upon subsequent listens, the seemingly nonsensical non-sequiturs become thought provoking commentary on distractions and degradation, more relevant now than ever.   If you like how the bass plays with the Zappa-esque orchestral accompaniment, listen to Diagonals by Stereolab.
Popping it on now
Love *Again…*
Still love what's going on in the guy's tingeltangelhersenpan. Reckon this record will be a lot of fun live, so definitely going to check out the new show somewhere.
Magistraler dan de grote zon
I love it, but I love Dorian’s weirder shit. Good to hear Clarence Clarity on production again.
Fun one, love the "*high noooootes"*
I’ve been waiting for the proper follow up to Slide. Loving this sound. Stoked to hear what he’s been cooking up these last few years.
So goddamn hype for this. *Slide* is one of my favorite albums of the last decade, and our boy George can do no wrong in my eyes.
George is actually goated, what an amazing track
King George is Back
Man this one takes me back
holy hell this gives me savage garden vibes a little I’m obsessed
God I love the ‘90s. Need the new George album expeditiously. Nobody doing this as good as he is.
He played this at Electronicon last August. Hopefully this means a new album coming soon
Slide is already in my top ten albums of all time. I’m unbelievably stoked for this next one.

Yeah really excited to hear a new GC record, I was actually worried for a second he might just fade out and not release anything substantial. I enjoyed the tracks with the dude from 311 but definitely want to hear a full length follow-up to Slide, one of the most enjoyable indie records of the 2010s.
Yea he said sometime this summer 👀
I loved the way the songs flow into each other. And coronal was such a different sound for them but done so well. Really loved this album
favorite band never disappoints, this might be my favorite album of all time
Such a beautiful album, just had the most calm 45 minutes listening.
Can't believe the 1977 World Series champ Yankees manager recorded an album!
Loved Flora Fauna, one of my favorites of 2021. Let's see if this is a worthy followup
Oh my god she’s just the best. Willow is SO BEAUTIFUL. Love this and love Flora Fauna. Everyone who isn’t listening is missing out
Her best album, even beats Feeding Seahorses
This album is how sunday mornings feel. Beautiful and calming from front to back. Never heard of her before but will look into her prior records
She is impressive–hints of Joni Mitchell/Vashti Bunyan. I just heard about her from her marriage to the singer from Flyte (I think they play on some of the songs). "I Can't Get My Head Around You" is a highlight–quite a sweet and endearing song.
Can't wait to listen! I feel like the singles had better album art than the main album art but I'm sure the music itself is great
This is my introduction to her music and I like it a lot! Looking forward to diving deeper into her music
Another gorg album from her. She’ll always be my favorite songwriter.
Just fucking beautiful
Don’t sleep on this one. Love the sparse arrangements that still manage to have a lot of depth. Reminds me of “Mutable Set” by Blake Mills in that way.
Really connecting with this
Absolutely loving this so far! I've been waiting for this one to come out. Not disappointing in the slightest!
*pushesupglasses* Well she has a brand new fan
They shared way too many songs from it the album’s impact is low, but if I look beyond that it was a great album.
Kiss City and Olympus were fantastic, can't wait to hear the rest
I dug all the singles so...
I'm really happy folks on here get to hear this. I hope you guys dig it.
Didn't hear any of the singles and this album is hitting really hard. Killer guitar and searing emotion. Great release.
Never heard of them before. Love their sound!
Her tour tickets are insanely cheap! 2 tix in NYC was only $50 (including fees!!!).   Her next tour won’t be as cheap I assume
Cringe lyrics
It’s a strategy that makes sense to create buzz for a new band but it does diminish the returns of the album listening experience.   I imagine she’ll probably follow up with a new batch of songs next year.
I’ve started to avoid listening to any singles maybe 1 or 2 to stop ruining new albums. I can’t stand the “announce album 6 months from now and release 6 of the 12 best songs from the album as singles” approach.
True, but I really like the songs that weren’t released early too. It’s a really great album.
I think the lyrics are really strong. They’re incredibly revealing, almost embarrassingly so. But that level honesty is what I like about them. I think she’s pretty clever with how she uses rhyme and “line breaks” to break up her thoughts too. The bridge of Sepsis is a good example of this.
Cringe comment.
Most labels do this for developing artists since it creates momentum in a field where it’s tough to break bands through touring like we used to before.   The model flipped to where we are online first live second instead of the other way around.    Source: signed to a label as a developing artist
I’ll keep listening. I don’t hate it.
I like the music
This was a solid album, happy to hear more from these sessions.
Were recorded after the album was finished, according to her bandcamp. The 90s vibes are even bigger with the new tracks, I hope they're heralding the general sound for whatever project she does next
This is so good. Love the evolution of this band.
I love this band so much. This album is great. A bit darker and more atmospheric if that’s even possible. Moody little album for sure. I will have this on repeat for a long time. ♥️🫀♥️🫀
What a band they are.  Here's an interview about the album for those interested.  http://sun-13.com/2023/04/07/noise-pollution-in-conversation-with-facs-brian-case/
Thanks!
This makes me very sad and I didn’t know she was suffering from cancer. MCA and her was not the connection I was hoping for.  RIP
I never go tot see Luscious Jackson, but I did see Kostars and enjoyed them quite a lot.   This is really sad.  59 is too short of a life.
Like all of their music, this is insane. It sounds both like Heaven and he’ll through the lens of SEGA Saturn. Jaw dropping aesthetically, really unique stuff
oooh been looking forward to this!
Angel never misses
how does this man keep doing it????   (I have not listened to this album yet but this is probably what I would say if I did)
seeing him live this weekend. cant wait.
Oh cool didn't know he had a new one coming. Existential dread in the form of ambient has got to be my favorite gender.
He really is the best isn’t he.
oh hey look, my favorite artist of all time. this album is another great one, very minimalist and bears similarities to the film/TV score work he's been doing.  i'm really digging the jazz sax on Monotony II
So amazing! Such touching music. The ambiguity of his tunes are otherworldly makes me feel new pits of existential panic haha. Love it.
Only one listen yet but really liking it. Anxiety hits like a truck.
This is good, but I miss his earlier work where he had more drones. His first 6 albums until Ravedeath, 1972 are classic. He leaned into very boreal, droning ambient with those albums that is similar to Biosphere, Thomas Köner, Gas, even Stars of the Lid to an extent. All of those albums feel like a complete unit, flow from song to song with a uniform theme. With Virgins, which to be fair, is a very good album, he started getting more esoteric, abstract, more percussive, and less droney. Songs are staggered and with less of a cohesive theme. They're fine albums but less magical than the others. No Highs has some drone, but the more distinct and memorable parts of the album are in the same style he's done for 10 years now.
this was fantastic
Had no idea that this was being released. Our boy Timmy never misses. In Your Mind was my favorite.
I just listened to it and I can confirm that this was my reaction. Nobody else quite like him.
Have seen before, up there with voices from the lake and donato dozzy as the best electronic act I’ve ever seen.
Enjoy.
You’re lucky, enjoy it! So disappointed when I saw he’s skipping my country on his tour.
I kinda feel the same way about his more recent records. Still gotta listen to this new one. But Ravedeath will probably always be my fav from him.
I almost done with this album. It's pretty darn good if you're into Orchestral/Symphonic music. Definitely cool to see how different this is to what we're used to hearing from Daft Punk.
Listening to it currently and am definitely enjoying it also.  I expected a more unusual or avant guard orchestral piece, but it has more of a soundtrack vibe.
Agreed. I listen to a lot of soundtrack/score albums and this definitely had that feel to it. Especially towards the end where it seems like it was building up to correspond with something visually, at least that's how I felt.
He composed it for a ballet, so it is a soundtrack of sorts.
Really really liking this. The opener here is wonderful; it’s a propulsive, noisy start to the album and it does so much in a minute and a half. There’s a definite Modest Mouse vibe in the guitars too that I appreciate. Love how they mix Alt-Country sonic elements with the noisier ones too. The pedal steel is such an underutilized instrument in general and it works really well here. All the slide guitar across the album is top class too.   Also loving Bull Believer (of course), as well as Get Shocked, Turkey Vultures, and Bath County. They’re some of the highlights for me after only one listen.  I loved Boat Songs (the guitarist, MJ Lenderman’s solo album) from last year, and was excitedly anticipating this album as a result. It definitely lives up to expectations. I really dig Formula One off this new album too; and it almost sounds like one of the lower key Alt-Country cuts off Boat Songs.
Wow it’s been a good while since an album has hit me this hard this instantly. I was already obsessed with the singles leading up to it but the whole thing is bangers only. I can’t believe how good the non-singles are, they were spoiled for choice! The hype has been more than earned and I’m super glad to see them getting their dues after personally feeling like Twin Plagues was a bit slept on.
"Chosen to Deserve" is an instant classic song for me.
I'm so glad this band is finally becoming as huge as they should be. I was so sad when twin plagues didn't end up in indieheads top 100 albums of 2021 and it seems like this one might even make it in the top 20 with the reception it's getting. Makes me proud to be from North Carolina!! (Not much else does recently)
This has been my most listened to band for the last 4 months ish so I've been really looking forward to this one. Got the CD in the mail today and listened to it 3 times already + once in the car. Really digging it a lot so far.   'Turkey Vultures' fucking kicks ass, that track really stands out to me so far for the unreleased songs from the album.  Can't wait to see them live in May in LA!
Turkey Vultures fucking slaps big time.
North Carolina legends!!
One of the best bands rn. Really cool mixes of shoegaze and throwbacks to old country. Gonna go listen now :)
AOTY JUST DROPPED (i’ll listen to it tomorrow)
This is great. Haven't listened to anything else they've done, but will be digging through their discography. Any recommendations on where to start?
This album sounds like Hop Along and Waxahatchee had a child and I'm here for it.
I got the vinyl a few days early and this is already my AOTY. Sorry Yo La Tengo. Big moment for Bootgazers  Edit: [8.8 damn it! I was so close!](https://old.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/12bozd7/tuesday_daily_music_discussion_04_april_2023/jezle95/)
First time listening to them and Chosen to Deserve is a banger.
I’m truly at a loss for words here, this album exceeded every expectation I had. Incredibly cohesive and brilliant. Going right to my record shop after work tomorrow to pick this up on vinyl.
Such a great album - Quarry is definitely the stand-out non-single imo
Really fucking good. Find it kinda weird that despite liking all of the singles, I still wasn't expecting to enjoy this as much as I am. Might end up cracking my top albums come the end of the year.
Turkey Vultures is everything I could ever possibly want from this band -- it's the clear highlight for me other than Bull Believer.  On first listen, I think I prefer how much heavier Twin Plagues was, but this isn't bad at all!  I'm also feeling the mandella effect heavy because I swore that was the last track on the album but it's not
Gawd this is so good but I just realized they basically released half of it lengthwise before today with the singles since Bull Believer and Chosen to Deserve are the longest songs on the album.  So my only disappointment is that there isn't more but what's there is effing fantastic.  I love all of the songs but for some reason the slower tunes Formula One and What's So Funny are hitting me harder rn.  I actually started tearing up on Formula One.  Maybe it's just Karly's voice that gets me.  Looking forward to seeing them live in May with Cryogeyser!
I was ready for this to be good but this surpassed all expectations, easy AOTY contender. The singles were all amazing, but every other previously unheard track is just as good, if not better. AVL gang rise up
yeah, this album fucking rips. perfect balance between blown out, shoegazey guitars and beautiful country tunes. lyrics are raw and in your face in a great way, very honest writing. going to be spinning this one for a looooong time!
This album is so good. Speaks to a very specific Carolina/southern upbringing that I can absolutely relate to. Hits me similar to how REM’s Fables of the Reconstruction did when I first heard it.
My vinyl showed up early yesterday!  Dang this is so GOOD!! There's a bit of everything happening here and the parts that are familiar remind me of their influences in the best ways possible!
Never heard these guys before but holy shit that opening track has me hooked. Time to dig in.
So cool to see this band get attention. Friend of my mine opened for them at a local show and they unexpectedly blew my ass off. Been hooked ever since
This is sounding very good. Another level up for this band. My early favs outside the singles are Formula One and Turkey Vultures. The track What's So Funny kinda reminds me of the band Idaho.
So glad this was the Secretly Society Album of the Month. Excited to pick it up later today.
I don’t know why but this band goes so fucking hard after I’ve had like 2 drinks. I need to see them live.
Albums immaculate— everything I wanted and some. The ebbs and flows and balance throughout are something else. Perfect balance of alt-country, shoegaze, indie, and just perfectly witty vocals from Karly (as always). Early AOTY candidate for me!   Catching them in Atlanta, Charlotte, and Asheville on their tour….literally cannot wait.
It’s a great day!!!! Loving this so far. Nobody is doing it like Wednesday right now
i'm obsessed with the way she writes these songs-- i'm insanely jealous and wish i wrote all of them! i'm so stoked for them to be picking up and can't wait to catch them on tour in May.
WOW. was not prepared for this album, and I'm a fan of Wednesay. Really, really excellent, and her sing screaming really ...hit home for me. Great record
Excellent album. And their covers album is one of the best covers albums of the 21st century in my book.
Well, it has been a while since I listened to an album in full 3 times in a row. This really ticks all them boxes hey? Guitars, production, vocals, melody and most of all how it works together. AOTY?!
8.8 BNM lets goooo. Excited to give this a listen
Gives me “I’m hardcore and I have plants in my apartment” vibes. 9/10.
Since Boat Songs I've been hyped up about them! The instrumentals are amazing, really in love with Wednesday/MJ, they deserve much more attention
“Violently came up in a Dollar General / You took too much” really paints a visceral picture
Damn, first time listening to this band and I legit was choking up by the end of Bull Believer. Rest of the album is good and flew by
Gave it 4 listens overnight/this morning and I'm loving it, easily their best yet for me. Does a really good job of being Wednesday but with bigger Indie label polish.   The polish really works in their favor too, as Lenderman really fucking knows how to dial in a guitar tone. Sometimes as the recording quality increases with a noisy band like this the overall sound or feeling suffers, but that's absolutely not the case here, this thing fucking rules. Sounds great front to back.  I do really love the album and I'm sure it's only going to grow on me but I already do have a few gripes.  -	The first is that I still can't believe they put out Bull Believer as the first single and then followed it up with this album. I think Bull Believer is a borderline perfect song and easily the best Wednesday song. It's also incredibly noisy and explosive in a way that the rest of this album, while, again, fantastic, is just not. 8 months later and 4 listens into this album I still just want to go play Bull Believer again.  -	I also thought and still think the other single choices were strange. Chosen to Deserve and Bath County, specifically the former, are two of the most accessible songs I've heard from them and I don't think either really work. I get why they'd be the singles when you're trying to push an album but my hype was torpedoed fast when I first heard Chosen to Deserve. Still don't much care for those songs. TV in the Gas Pump is also a weird choice but mostly just because it's kind of a short, semi-subdued little closer. Good song but weird single. -	And then the last thing is that for whatever reason the lyrics like "We were drinking bottles of Round-Up weed killer that we stole from dollar general on an air mattress in the abandoned trailer park and it was stinky because the hot and humid air mattress was covered in piss and vomit" feel a little much here. I know it's kind of Karly's thing, and when it works it works really well and is a big part of what makes the band great, but here it feels laid on a bit too thick sometimes. Feels like it's more effective when used sparingly. Maybe just a me thing.  Overall though I've really been enjoying this. If the album ended up just being Bull Believer a few times in a row I would've preordered a $200 4LP box set without a second thought, so having these other, great songs is more than enough. This band fucking rules so much
Oh yeah oohhhh yeah it’s so good!!
Happy to see that the comments in this thread aren't BCNR style hyperbole (yet). I fear the hype on this one
It’s sooooo good yall
Really loving this, particularly how it leans more into country (Formula One is an early standout). Boat Songs was one of my favorite albums from last year, but Wednesday never quite clicked outside of a couple of songs (not surprisingly, their country covers). Chosen to Deserve is my SOTY so far and (unpopular opinion) pretty relieved that there aren't more Bull Believers on this record. Not sure if it will quite be an AOTY contender - Boat Songs was pretty immediate and this seems like a record with more depth - but it's a huge step forward for the band and an album that will get a lot of play as the weather warms up.
Has any other band ever released 3 near-perfect albums in a row, 3 years in a row???
Weird…the vox leave a lot for me to be desired.
I like this band in general, absolutely love MJ Lendeman’s solo stuff and all he contributes, but the vocals here are kinda putting me off in a way they hadn’t before. The song where she’s just screaming bloody murder the whole time makes me never want to revisit it. I think overall this is a nice band that’s never gonna actually take the leap for me into something special.
wednesday and mj lenderman have made me a pedal steel convert. would love to hear it utilized more widely.
Boat Songs was easily my AOTY. MJ put on a great show in DC recently
Can't get enough of Twin Plagues.
NC represent!! Another upcoming band from Asheville is Kerosene Heights. Check em out.
It was certainly one of my AOY I listened to it a lot!
Twin Plagues is fucking great. One More Last One is an all time song.
Same here! I had Handsome Man pop up on my discover playlist awhile back and I fell in love with their sound. Fantastic group.
Spin it like a helicopter!
Twin Plagues and their covers album are both great. Check out their guitarist MJ Lendermans album Boat Songs too, it has a ton of the same members as Wednesday
Handsome Man from Twin Plagues. Whole album's good, that song rules especially.
I'll be the one person who says *I Was Trying to Describe You to Someone*.
Don’t sleep on the guttering ep
I doubt there is anyone in these comments that doesn't already listen to Hop Along, but if you don't, and you love this album, listen to Hop Along!! They are my favorite band ever ❤️❤️ the songs I would recommend to fans of Wednesday would be Sister Cities, Buddy in the Parade, Texas Funeral, One That Suits Me, Look of Love, and Prior Things ❤️❤️(I love get disowned too but it's a different vibe imo)
This gets me hype
That's the one that hit me too
That's a weird way to pronounce Turkey Vultures
The verses on Quarry echo Waterloo Sunset
Agreed. I’ve listened 3 times in the last day. The hype is real - not surprised by that of course.
Yea my only “complaint” with the album is that they showed us they can make Bull Believer so early and then didn’t make the album like 6 Bull Believers.  I was a Wednesday fan before and listened regularly enough but they weren’t like my favorite or anything, when Bull Believer came out I was convinced this would be AOTY, then with the rest of singles and the full album I’m back to a regular fan with just Bull Believer being basically SOTY.
i totally see what you mean w the lyrics comment, but i do like it quite a bit. there’s a lot of really vivid imagery scattered all throughout that’s instantly nostalgic for me — or maybe nostalgia isnt the right word, but they conjure specific, real memories in a way that i havent had happen in a while.   still — i wonder what a wednesday album with a more cohesive story/throughline would sound like? like an ethel cain-type approach to the southern gothic imagery?
I agree on the singles aside from Bath County which I really like. Gotta go listen to Bull Believer for the 1000th time after this comment reminded me how incredible it is.
Laughed out loud at the lyrics you made up but yea I have the same complaint, wish it was used more sparingly instead of just on every single song
Lol are you acting like Wednesday is a first in music history? I hope Wednesday fans don’t become a meme
my bloody valentine… if you ignore all the gaps between albums lmao  Edit: I think a less jokey answer would actually be Animal Collective if we're talking about the more "modern" indie era. Sung Tongs (2004) --> Feels (2005) --> Strawberry Jam (2007) --> Merriweather Post Pavilion (2009). Not exactly a year between all albums, but pretty damn close. Also one of the most legendary runs in early 2000s indie music.   If we're talkin' bout the classic era of indie/alternative then Sonic Youth is a no-brainer. EVOL (1986) --> Sister (1987) --> Daydream Nation (1988).
That's funny cause i love her yelpy vocals.
Agreed
Do you like Cass Mccombs? I feel like he employs the pedal steel tastefully in a lot of his music
 Check out the album Animal Drowning by Knifeplay. You’ll love it; it’s more mellowish shoegaze but they incorporate steel guitar and it’s amazing.
Unfortunately I missed the show he played in CA! The next time he comes I’ll definitely go. Also, if you haven’t listened to his self titled debut album from 2019, I’d highly recommend it. It’s not quite as good as Boat Songs, but it’s really fantastic. Great alt country in the vein of Jason Molina/Drive By Truckers/a bit of Neil Young.
This was an incredible show, are you going to Wednesday at black cat?
Oh hell yeah this is awesome, thanks for the rec!
AHH I didn't know MJ Lenderman was involved. Really enjoyed boat songs. Cheers for the recommendation.
I feel so silly I didn’t even register that Mowing the Leaves was a cover album until this comment
One More Last One sounds like it would fit seamlessly on Loveless by MBV. So spot on.
Fate Is… sounded awesome on Audiotree Live.
A highway-driving, windows-down kinda song.
Thought this same thing when i first heard it. Waterloo Sunset is an all time great song
I remember hearing Bull Believer live in late 2021 and being absolutely awestruck and thinking “what the FUCK is this song????”   the ~1 year wait for it to release was brutal   But as long as that wait was, I think that   1) it shouldn’t have been a single  2) it should have been the closer
This is how I feel about it too! When she nails the thing she's doing, it really elevates the music. It's a huge reason I love this band. I have the same memories she does, I know the feelings and the smells and the situations and how kind of grotesque it all can be. It's awesome. Just feels like she went a bit overboard with it on this album and it's most effective for me when presented sparingly and with other content juxtaposed against it.  What you mention about a more cohesive through line is my absolute ideal. If she could balance out the lyricism and really focus in on a concept she could write something absolutely unbelievable.
I can’t tell if I love or hate the piss-yellow Fanta line
Did you see the paste article? They're already a meme
god, that '04-'09 anco run is fucking incredible.
Cass is a genius
Which Cass album has the most prominent pedal steel work?
Oh yeah, I have gone through his whole discog since Boat Songs was released. I am just starting to get into Wednesday now.
I wasn't planning on it. I don't know Wednesday that well, and I'm going to the boygenius thing at merriweather that Friday
I randomly found out about them last year when they were brand spanking new. Just saw them in Raleigh two weeks ago and got to hang with them. They even gave me a shoutout during their set.
Maura is the song that I discovered them from. It’s a great jam
Big Wheel and others
Me too with Wednesday. Since you’ve already heard MJ’s earlier stuff, I’d recommend this obscure alt country album that came out last year called “I Looked Out” from Greg Freeman. Someone recommended it based on liking Boat Songs. I’d check it out sometime. Hope you like the new Wednesday album too.
Thanks!
Sweet, I'll check it out!
Yeah, that Greg Freeman album is great. Needs to be heard by more people.
They’re on different albums but “harmonia” and “Medusa’s outhouse” are both pedal steel tracks
It is right? It’s not as great as Boat Songs in my opinion but it isn’t too far off. Long Distance Driver is the standout for me; it’s one of my top 3 most played tracks so far this year. It’s just a super solid album front to back. It’s crazy that both albums came out in the same year; I haven’t heard alt country albums that great in a while. I’m recommending it to anyone who liked Boat Songs or is into that style of Alt-Country.  Purple Mountains is my favorite Alt Country album of the past decade but it’s a lot harder to listen to casually than the aforementioned ones.
Agree on all points, and "Colorado" is a ripper as well. And yeah, Purple Mountains is quite difficult to listen to in the context of what happened, especially "All My Happiness is Gone."
Yes! Time to cry.
Just commenting to say how I think this is one of their best records and that there isn’t a song less than an 8/10 on this album. To Rage, Wish I Could Cross The Sea, Neptune, Junkmail, and Isolation are just mindblowing. Understand people’s longing for the old Daughter sound though, I just didn’t have that mindset going into it and think I’ve fared all the better for it, because this is remarkable.
I have been obsessed with Party since they released it (maybe my most played song of the year?), but sadly there doesn’t seem to be much else like it here on this album.   They are still quite great at creating an atmosphere and trying out interesting sounds to get lost in, but I would’ve loved fewer experimental tracks and more with a structure like Party which let you appreciate Elena’s voice more. Only Dandelion, Future Ex-Lover and To Rage kinda do so.   I was also hoping there would be a late explosive track like Fossa or Shallows (maybe the best things they’ve ever done?) but sadly that never came.
Wish I could cross the sea is a nice closer.
I think this is my favourite of theirs
What a beautiful release. I‘m generally prone to getting goosebumps when I‘m touched by a song but it‘s rare for me to be as consistently plunged into bliss as when those low strings hit in *Be on your Way*
I’ve been counting days to listen to this album, but I’m afraid I’m a bit underwhelmed after a couple spins. They are straying further away from the signature Daughter sound, and though I absolutely loved the direction Elena Tonra went with Ex:Re, I’m not a huge fan of the last two Daughter records. Of course, it’s great that a band/artist grows out of their typical sound - but I must confess, their earlier releases speak to my taste more.   Anyway, I hope they announce a tour and head here. Despite everything, they are among my top 5 artists I want to see live.
I'm ready to be hurt again
this album NEEDS MORE GUITAR. Why does it seem like they're hiding it? Every song kind of sound the same, at least tempo-wise.
I have to agree, I‘m underwhelmed as well especially because the best songs from the album were released as singles beforehand. I wish there were more "hooks" (for a lack of a better word). Most of the songs just meander a bit too much.   It‘s not bad by any means but I‘ve listened to it twice and aisde from the singles and Neptune, I don‘t remember much.
It's not quite as cutting as some of their best stuff; it's meandering and emotionally monotone in the way Ex:Re often felt, but I enjoyed it overall.
Lol that’s what Candles makes me do
Even so, Party is making me dance in my living room.
See, I'm very much inclined to agree with you over the more disappointed commenters. I'm only a casual fan of Daughter, so I do really enjoy a couple of their early albums, but they're not on repeat for me and I don't have a strong attachment to how the album is supposed to sound.  That lack of expectation leads me to really enjoy what they're putting out here.
I actually liked Ex:Re album more than this. I’m underwhelmed too
See, I on the other hand thought ex:re was boring as hell. I was excited to hear drums on a Daughter song again.
Nice! Out for sushi rn so didn’t get to listen to it yet. How’d ya like it?
It’s one of my all time favorite albums, it would be hard to top that and I didn’t expect it to happen, but I’d love a similar sound. I see Music From Before The Storm as the closest Daughter album to the Ex:Re sound, I wish they followed that path.
Yep fair enough. I honestly love my Daughter with minimal drums, and I think Ex:Re’s sound did more justice to the drums. Cello touch was also great. I mean it’s all just my opinion, but I think if I had to choose, I’d rather have an Ex:Re LP2 rather than this album. Not that it’s bad - I just love the other more.
The soundtrack took BTS from like a 4 to atleast an 8 in my opinion. One of my favourite soundtracks ever
And if that is lovely for your ears, more power to it. Here's to Elena doing another ex:re album for fans such as yourself in the future.
🤞
I've been worm-pilled.
This is so fucking great man, the singles work so much better in the context of the album. Haven't heard a concept album this awesome in some time wow
Fully expected to dislike this based off the first two singles (hadn't listened to The Worm), but some of these tracks are fantastic. If you can get on board with the fact this is pretty much a musical then I reckon you'll get a lot out of it.
I’m getting black midi vibes at certain points on this which is good cause I’ve exhausted myself on Hellfire but still wanted a little something to scratch that itch (first time HMLTD listener)
Pre-ordered it after hearing Wyrmlands, great record.
Saddest Worm Ever sounds like In Rainbows-era Radiohead and I love it, especially because it has such a dumb title
I didn't hear the singles before going in and was not prepared for an album about 🪱 to be this good
Gets better with every track
Is that the dude with the anaconda wiener from the show The Boys?
let’s goooooo
Really solid album, surprised they made this work as well as it does
If this record was released during the Glee era they would have covered Lay Me Down
I didn't care for their last album at all but I really liked the singles for this. Hoping the whole album is as good as the singles have led me to believe.
THIS IS WYRMLANDS, MOTHERFUCKER! POWER GETS YOU HIGH!
This is seriously good though what a treat. Always forget how massively talented HMLTD are the first few tracks are mesmerising.
I recommend Michael's song from their first LP
Was thinking the same thing. It's pulled off really well.
Finally lol  Feels like she’s been promoting this album forever now. Can’t wait to listen!
been excited for this
Wow that opening track is gorgeous  Edit: Ok the rest is also wonderful, I looooved What We Drew but am digging that she went harder with this one while still keeping the tenderness
Wow this album is dope, never heard anything by her before. Hitting the spot.
I liked What We Drew but I really like that she leaned a bit more on her harder, nightclubby sound for this
still waiting for Yaeji - WITH A STEEL CHAIR
This is so good! I’m floating to “AWAY X5”.
The beginning of Happy >>>>
Outstanding record thank you Yaeji!!
Effortlessly consistent, adore this album. Only gripe is that it’s quite short! I want more!!!
I don’t think it’s possible for Teleman to make a bad song. Great album, once again.
Gave this a chance and thought “this guy sounds like Pete and the Pirates I love their stud what happened to them” and it’s them! So excited right now to dive into this discog. Always loved them. Learned some of their songs on guitar.
I also recommend checking out Tom’s solo album, Only Magic! :)
HMLTD really have delivered a coherent fairytale/musical album in a progressive art rock style that sets them apart from other windmill adjacent bands. A brilliant LP in my opinion.
Hi Deerhoof!   In addition to rocking harder than anyone, and crafting more beautiful and intricate compositions than anyone.. your music is also hilarious. Some of the riffs, the decision making with the arrangement - it just makes me laugh.   So my question is, do y’all ever laugh as you’re composing or recording? Does humor ever factor in?
Sup Deerhoof! New album is off-the-charts good. Can’t wait for your Baltimore show. It’s fascinating to me that you all have been around for almost 30 years and are still making music as wacky and wonderful as the start, would you say there’s anything about your approach as a band/unit that has lent itself to that longevity?  PS: saw the recent Guitar World article, the mic setup for John and Ed is fucking wild
👍👍👍🐶-S
Thank you everyone for visiting! Hope to see you on Miracle-Level tour 2023. ~S
Saw y’all at elsewhere the other night, first time in over four years. Probably 9th time seeing deerhoof. It made me feel whole again :)  Question:  At this point, how does deerhoof make a set list?
so glad I got to see your show in philly last night. I played bass in the String Orchestra of Brooklyn when Greg was one of the soloists on Giga Concerto, so hearing Giga Dance live last night was so special! thank you! and thank you for using your platform to ask audiences to mask. appreciate your stance against ticketmaster too. you’re the best, safe travels on the rest of the tour
Hey is this thing working?
DEERHOOF! You are an inspiration and a force for positive creativity in a world that doesn't tend to nurture and reward creativity or positivity to such commercial success. Have you ever had a performance where the audience just either didn't get it or wasn't in to it and reacted negatively? If this has indeed happened, how did you react and how did it shape your subsequent  performances?  Thank you for the sheer musical joy you've brought to my life - and thank you to Satomi for taking a photo with me in West Hollywood in 2015 :)
Please repress The Runners Four!
Can you talk about the process of remotely composing and recording Actually You Can? Can’t quite wrap my head around how those songs were composed, arranged and performed without all being in a room together talking through each little section.   Love your new record and all your records so much!
Thanks, everybody!  This has been super fun.  See you out in the universe with all the sounds and the things.  -- J
You guys do some wicked stuff!  Thanks for the hard work, I for one, really enjoy it!
What's the smallest drum kit/setup Greg has ever used for a gig?
Questions from a KafeManiac: who drinks the most coffee in Deerhoof? And how does each of you like your coffee?
Do you come with what style you want for each album beforehand, or does it just kind of happen?
Hi Satomi. Jon here. We used to hang out a little in London 10 years ago. One question... HOW'S IT GOING?
Hi guys you always have cool choices of cover songs, what inspires you to cover something?
What is your favorite song to play live?
Siriustar is the song that defines an entire decade of my life. Thank you. Hope I get to see you guys play someday.
Apart from the superb pauses and comedic timing, what makes the perfect Greg verbal interlude? And have you ever started a sentence and completely failed to finish and somebody else had jump in and rescue you?
I’m actually in the audience right now! Y’all have some of the most interesting pre-show music I’ve heard in a while. What goes behind your pre-show choices?
Someone said my band in high school sounded like Deerhoof. Love the drums in perfect me, so staccato and syncopated. What’s the process of coming up with those cool crazy riffs?
Hey guys. What kinds of miracles are in your lives as of late
Hello Deerhoof! I am a huge tenniscoats fan and was delighted when I first discovered your collab as ONEONE. Any future projects in mind with Saya and Ueno?
Hi Hoof,   I’ve loved your music for so long, thanks for all the joy you’ve given to us over the years.   In a time when so many bands and artists are total chickenshits at expressing their politics, you keep your beliefs right at the center of your work and your public profile… how do you decide what to share, and why do you think more artists don’t take positions on aaaaaanything that matters?
hi, was at the nyc show with ceres and scarlet.. you guys rocked  my question is, how do u decide who plays what parts on the guitar lol , and whats the meaning behind the new album cover?
What is Deerhoof favorite color?
Dear Deerhoof,  It was truly amazing to read that this was the first album you have recorded in a studio! How do you feel about the experience?
When you tour or find out that you all will be returning to the road, are there restaurants that jump to your mind immediately when you see the date laid out. What are your most favorite food memories on the road?
Just want to say I love you guys and thanks for such wild and creative and beautiful music! Saw you in Ithaca a few years ago and it was an all time favorite show.   I notice a lot of times a guitar mirrors the vocal melody. Does one always come before the other or is it a mixed bag? Also, do you write for an album with certain songs in mind to play live? I imagine some of them are hard to replicate on stage. Thanks y’all, much love!
yooo guys!! had a lovely time last night. i'm curious about a couple things. it was so cool to hear the new record in japanese. how many languages can deerhoof speak altogether? also greg, i noticed this may have been a record small kick drum this tour, haha...have you ever thought about attempting to ditch it altogether and do some kind of standing-up rig?
Greg will we see the god snare again? And how was it made??
hey!! i was at the philly show last night — was wondering what guitar John was playing? Thanks!! y’all are the best!!
I have a decade of experience air drumming and air guitaring your songs. How can I transition these skills to real drums and guitars?
why doesn't the whole band move to new mexico?
Hey Ed, could you pretty please transcribe the guitar parts to "Ay That's Me"?
Hey!! Just saw y'all last night at Underground Arts in Philly, absolutely tore the roof off the place!   Biggest question for y'all as a whole:  Any advice for breaking out of boxes writing songs? Y'all rarely repeat yourselves, and that's always been insanely inspirational for me/my band as a whole. Just...easier said than done, and I find a lot of our songs are structurally pretty similar.  I know picking up a different instrument helps, and I do get different results writing on different guitars, drums, piano, etc. Was just wondering if y'all had any other suggestions to really push yourself out of your musical comfort zone and get something fresh?  Love y'all so much!
Is there any piece of gear that you once had, but no longer do, that you miss?
Shout out from South Africa. You think you guys would ever collab with Chris Cohen again any time soon? Would love that.
This is less a question and more just... I want the band to know how much they mean to me. It's hard to explain.  I've seen you at least ten times. I wasn't sold the first two times or so. Not until Runners Four came out and the world collectively jazzed themselves over it. (It "autocorrected" to "jazzed" and I'm gonna keep it that way.)  Then I saw you at Berbati's Pan in 2005 on the tour for that album and it... almost seems like a scene from a movie. My future girlfriend met me there after catching the last bus. It was the first show I saw with my best friend after he turned 21. It was the firs time I met my future drummer and keyboard player for my next band.   Other stuff happened.   I didn't know life could be that good, and it's been all downhill from there, really. Except for Deerhoof. You've never let me down! I can always look forward to seeing you live and a new record! The new one is my favorite of the decade so far!!!!!    Arigatou
Hey deerhoof! First of all- congrats on the new record it sounds great!  Question for Greg: Deerhoof and the Oh Sees are two of my favorite bands, and I was surprised to hear in a John Dwyer interview that when he first moved to the west coast he was looking to recruit you as a member of the Oh Sees. Do you remember John ever reaching out?
do u all have any favorite japanese bands to recommend?
Ed - what is your hair care routine?
I have just discovered the dynamic, playful greatness of Deerhoof a few weeks ago, and this feels really timely.  I’m completely hooked on The Runners Four, and just hearing the first few moments of it makes me feel warm and fuzzy with an inexplicable urge to just start smiling, which persists throughout the entire album… I think I am in love with it… as I type this is have Odyssey running through the back of my mind over and over…  I’ve listened through two other albums near Runners Four, chronologically speaking… if you were to direct a new fan where to jump in to your later catalogue, where would you tell them to start? And why?
How do you all get such a good bass guitar tone recorded vs live?
Hey y’all! This is Travis from CAMP. After that week I’m not sure I have any questions left for ya, but wanted to say hi and thank you again for doing that!  Hope the tour is going well, see ya in Chicago!  EDIT: oh also loving Miracal-Level! Thanks for that too!
Love the new album. I'm gonna buy it tomorrow for bandcamp friday.  I know it a few albums back but I  was wondering if you would be kind enough to explain how your got the   guitar tones for the heavy  riff at 1.07. on your track Dystopic Creation doesn't fear you. The riff Right after the worry worry baby  lyric. How you stack the two driven tones on that is epic.
I saw you guys live in 2012 at the Evolve fest in Antigonish, NS and it blew me away.  I'd never heard you before, and I've been a huge fan ever since.   Just wondering if you had any fun memories or stories from that show.  Thanks.
I always miss these when you do them, so I’m glad I caught it this time.   The new album is great, I’ve actually been listening all day today. I’m really glad you guys are bringing the Gorge Trio esque vibes back into the compositional picture more often while still retaining utter Deerhoof identity. Jet-Black Double-Shield is really gorgeous stuff.  Who can bring me back to the Friend Opportunity era and tell me about the formation of the piece Look Away? I’ve always been really curious as to how it was constructed, did John create a framework on guitar that was later augmented by Greg with various keyboards? For years I have pondered how the dense yet minimal landscapes of that particular piece were able to manifest themselves. It wasn’t until I saw you guys perform it live in NYC Feb 2019 that I was able to fully appreciate the arrangement that was put together for it. Ever since then I’ve deeply wondered about its creation and if there was anything significant about its process.  Been a fan for 16 years! Thank you for doing what do, and continuing to do what you do. It’s so marvelous. Sorry if this is a dork question btw
Hey Deerhoof! Huge fan, just wanted to ask,  1. How do you come up with those crazy cool drum parts Greg?  2. What was the songwriting/creative process for this new album?  Love the record guys, thanks so much!
What does Greg sing in new sneakers?
What’s this guitar I’ve seen Ed playing in recent photos? Almost looks like a Fender Lead.   New album rules by the way. Thanks!
Before miracle level, I’ve seen y’all mic up your electrics (the guitars themselves) in at least one video. It’s kindve like the ultimate pickup!! What was different about that technique on miracle level?
Do you know a guy named J-Hole? If so, how do you feel about him?
Hi Deerhoof, enjoying Miracle-Level and happy to add Apple O to my vinyl collection.   The new album is notably produced, recorded, and mixed all in studio for the first time. Pros, cons? Plans to continue with that method it uncertain at this point?  Soundtracks? Perhaps they exist and I’m unaware, but any chance be of Deerhoof scoring sone films.  Y’all are wonderful, thank you.
Was supposed to be at the providence show tonight, but sprained my ankle very bad walking my dog in the woods this afternoon.  Hopefully not broken.  Bummed to miss the show.  Love yas
Are the drums on paradise girls reamped?
Hi deerhoof. Love u guys. What advice would you give to someone wanting to begin making their own music but doesn't quite know where to start
What is the name of John’s Studio in Minneapolis? I’d love to book time in the future!
hey deerhoof this one's for greg: what are your main drumming inspirations, i absolutely love your playing!
I've been a huge fan for like 10 years I think ! Your music really accompanies my life in every way. There's never a time i don't wanna listen to deerhoof ! :)   It's so comforting that a band like yours exist ! I love every deerhoof song, they all have a special place in my heart, so every time you release new music i know it's just more joy for me !! ♥   I just saw you live once so i can't wait for you to come back to France or some place not too far ! ♫     Question : What do you like to do together when you are not playing music ?
Aw man my beloved Deerhoof. Ya’ll have been a constant source of inspiration for me since 2000. Thank you love you ❤️  1st Q: What were your big inspirations/heavy listens back in the first 10 or so years of the band?   2nd Q: Deserted island recording set up. Everyone gets 3 main pieces of gear. What are they?
I noticed the the album friend opportunity is extremely hi fi to my ears especially the perfect me. It seems like a departure to the work that came before it, which sounded great as well, but the low end on FO is out of this world. Who recorded it?
Can you talk about writing Look Away, and would you ever play it live?  Also, would you count After Dinner as an influence?
Hi Deerhoof1 I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO SEE YOU PLAY IN MANILA. Any chance of coming to New Zealand in the pipeline?
Do you guys every use alternate tunings like dsdgbd etc.
Do any deerhoof songs start life as notated scores? If so, which songs?
Im eating falafel- do you guys want some?
Hi Deerhoof, I was just woondering, how do you do today?
How does it feel to simultaneously bash Spotify regularly while actively using it and uploading your music on the platform?
are we doing to hear some saxophone on a deerhoof song in the near future?  pleaseeeeeeeee
Was supposed to be at the providence show tonight, but sprained my ankle very bad walking my dog in the woods today.  Hopefully not broken.  Bummed to miss the show.  Love yas
Hello!  So this is a weird question, but when you guys played on Valentine's Day here in Charleston SC back in 2007 (w/ the Harlem Shakes I think) you threw out orange wristbands to the crowd.  I used to wear it for YEARS then all the text rubbed off and I lost it... so I can't remember what it said on them.  Any idea?  &#x200B;  EDIT: Btw, the new record is an all-timer for me.  Appreciate you for the years of music.
hey Deerhoof! killer show last night! (hope you like the tape, Greg!)  How did you decide the setlist for the *Devil Kids* show (and subsequently, this tour)? It's a strong mix of classics and deep cuts.
Greg, have you considered making improvisational music with other drummers? i loved your work with brian chippendale, and i would love to hear you collaborate with more people different from your unique style!
Ever since I got into you guys’ music, I’ve been trying to play guitar with the same level of unbridled and unhinged joy that your music is filled with.  Thank you
New album rules.  Have you ever considered working with Chris Cohen again?  Would be wild to see what you'd cook up together since he's been doing his own thing for awhile now.  PS John you have the best guitar tones of all time.
Deerhoof!! Long time listener, first time caller. 🤓 Love all your work. You’ve found the ultimate musical freedom and trust between members which in itself is amazing and inspiring. Does what you have as a unit make it hard to get together with others for random jams?
The new album is great! I really hope to see you at Wilco’s Solid Sound Festival one of these years
Hi, love y’all so much, been a big fan for decades.  What motivates the change is track order on different releases of some albums? Ive seen differences in vinyl va cd releases originally, but also changes from for instance original Apple O’ release and the polyvinyl reissue, and the Offend Maggie reissue, years later. I like the new track orders but I admit that they took getting used to initially.
What's up deerhoof, do You like shoegaze? What's Your fav guitar pedal?
Not a question, but I just wanted to say that the devil and his anarchic surrealist retinue makes me feel like I can rule the world every time I hear it and your new album is such a bright highlight of this year. Thanks for all that you three do!
Hi Deerhoof!  I’ve been a fan since 2016, you guys are so amazing!  Question: will you guys ever return to Juan’s basement?
Greg! Why do you look so much like Stewart Copeland from The Police?
Do you get royalties from Spotify streams of your music?
After decades of playing live, how do you still keep up the energy to bring it home, show after show?
20 years ago I saw you guys perform in Denton, TX.  You had cookies that you gave to fans, which I thought was kinda the coolest thing ever at the time.  How does it feel to be a band still, 20 years later?
What’s the story behind the album art for miracle level?
Do you guys hang out outside of being in a band?
What are your favorite movies?
I showed up late to a curtains show in Denton TX a long time ago and missed the set.   Still sour about that.
Just wanted to say, love your work and I found you guys from the worried noodles album with "you, dog". You guys rock, thanks for always making awesome content. Got me through the COVID pandemic working in retail, made it bearable. Thank you
Hellooo! Long time fan here ❤️ How do you find the balance as a team between planning/figuring out the structure of a song/album and letting things flow creatively? Thanks for all your hard work your music always makes me smile
Hey guys, nice work on the recent album!  I've also really enjoyed the Congotronics International live album that finally came out last year. Terrific work on the mixing on that one, Greg. The included memories from the tour from everyone involved paint a really wholesome picture!  Do you all keep contact from time to time? Would you repeat such a project at all? It does seem like a once in a lifetime thing thought, perhaps better to keep the magic as is.
Hope I'm not too late to say I LOVE the Congotronics International album, as its a new entry into a long lineage of beautiful African and Western musical fusion. I've been a fan of the style since I first heard Material's album Hallucination Engine in the early 90s, and since then have been really into the Tzadik and Axiom labels' fusion records.   My question to you all is what are your favorite fusion projects? Do you plan to record more with Congotronics, or any other African groups? Are you considering any new renditions in the style of "super duper rescue allstars"? I would like to nominate Paradise Girls first.   Anyway, speaking for me and my partner, we just love you guys so much. I have so much to ask and to say but it all just comes down to THANK YOU!!!!!
YAY Deerhoof!!!, sorry I missed your AMA, but carry on with your badass selves cuz what ya'll do is GREAT
Hi Deerhoof!!  Is your Hofner 500/1 bass still played often since you acquired the Serek bass?
Just wanted to say I love y’alls music. No question
Hey any chance you can link to your Philly opener's music? They said their music would be hard to find online and they weren't lying lol.   Also, this was my first time seeing you guys. What an amazing show!
I saw you perform live in Portland at Revolution Hall. It was a mind-bending parade of sounds and textures and rhythms. How do you write such intricate stuff that sounds cohesive yet complex?
Bollocks, as if I fucking missed this.  Worst sub name
Fucking legends. Love you all <3
Looooong time fan! Any plan to tour Korea?
Idk who you are since I got this recommended to me by reddit, but what is your opinion on ketchup?
Oh yes, of course.  We spend more laugh time than doing anything else.  The best is watching people try to learn new parts and fail.
if we dont laugh it doesnt make the cut  \-g
we dont use 99% of what we come up with. iow not too judgy when coming up with ideas. then sort thru.  g
Yes! Thank you all for coming to chat with us! - Ed
no Colorado dates?
each days setlist is created right after the previous day's show is over and everyone registers their complaints  g
Genevieve ive been meaning to ask! i just wrote a 34 minute piece for string orchestra and at the moment the only ensemble i have to play it is my computer's midi!  g
I think I heard you whoop when we started that (or it was someone else) -- J
hack yasss
> didn't get it  Hahahaha, of course.  Much of our lives on tour has been looking at confused faces, but usually people don't get too aggro about it.  That's one nice thing about live music.  Even if you don't like something, if the person is right there in front of you trying their best, making the music they want to make, it's hard to get too mad at them.  I mean, they could be building bombs or something instead . . . -- J
there was that show in modesto where the door guy shined his flashlight into our eyes while we were playing. he didnt like it. we had so so many shows like that. i think it helped us play better. it's like slipping on a banana peel as you walk on stage, it breaks the ice and you can relax and then really cool things start happening. but in fact we feel extremely well loved and rewarded overall. far beyond wildest dreams. we're very grateful  g
It's going to happen (don't tell anybody) -- J
everybody had demos and some of them were almost in the same tempo, or the keys matched up. i had a really vivid dream one night that we were opening for radiohead again and when i woke up it was 4am and temporarily seemed to have the ability to assemble all our fragmentary ideas into a tracklist of finished songs, it was very strange but very nice. so i did a lot of pitch shifting and speed correcting to the demo fragments to turn them into rough versions of songs and everyone liked them so we just recorded our parts on top of that and then cut out the demos in the final mix.  g
Theres never a set way a song happens. Sometimes someone writes a song complete, sometimes someone has a part and others will write to it. Sometimes someone will have a part and one of us will remember a part one of us wrote 5 years ago and then we'll change the key or whatever to make it work. It's a ton of back and forth. We did that and once we had the song forms together we each went through, greg laid down the drums first and sent them to us and we recorded our parts to that. - Ed
hard but fair! thank you  g
no matter how small they get i cant get them to be quiet
definitely john  i havent tried coffee yet  g
I think that may be John. At least on tour, I think I may beat him when we're at home but he does all the driving so he needs the extra POWER. - Ed
John drinks the most. I drink black coffee-S
At home, I have Earl Gray (or cardamom tea) in the morning and then a cup of coffee after lunch, and that's it, unless I'm recording with somebody or something like that.  For whatever reason, recording always makes drink like a pot of coffee.  But yeah on tour, coffee helps keep me focused when driving . . . -- J
we have meetings and memos and negotiations and we make decisions on what it will sound like and then when we start making the record it comes out totally different
We made a list of songs that inspired us and listen to them. The we discussed what we wanna make. S
Hi Jon! I am good. Hope to see you on our UK tour!
the theme. looking for double entendres.  g
the little maker  g
satomi wrote the words and i wrote the music. i think i was thinking of devendra banhart but it's hard to remember because that was almost 20 years ago  g
no one ever rescues me thats why i keep going
normally i have a playlist i play on my computer but im using the computer to do this AMA. i can sort of hear it through the floor, i think they're streaming perez prado radio?  g
thank you! the riff was first, i think i was thinking of hendrix and mitch mitchell. when we recorded it we were using electronic drums that i had just gotten (they stolen now) and we used Y-cables so that the hihats triggered multiple samples at the same time, like hihat sounds, a train bell, woodblocks. different sounds that were in the roland brain  g
My dog Oogie. Every day I marvel at how sweet and loving and happy to be alive he is. It makes me want to appreciate waking up for another day as well.  - Ed
Recovery of my left arm-S
SPRING, THE BIGGEST MIRACLE -- J
Thanks! I haven’t seen Saya for years. No future OneOne for now. I would like to see them play. -S
Thanks! I haven’t seen Saya for years. No future OneOne for now. I would like to see them play. -S
thank you. i cant speak for any other artists. but it does strike me as odd to be afraid. the internet can be cruel if you say something wrong, maybe that scares people. but i have been really educated and gratified by the experience of political conversations on social media. ive met a lot of friends via twitter discourse. ignoring trolls is my zazen.  g
That was fun show! Kunie Sugiura’s cover art was perfect for miracle-level. Her head is facing down and flowers are popping. Miracles are everywhere including you. Only few greedy non-miracles try to ruin us. -S
i saw kunie sugiura's work on my friend's social media and thought it looked good. we were looking for ideas for the cover. i send it to satomi and she realizes that she met kunie once. total coincidence. we got in touch and kunie was into us using that image. she was there at the nyc show! such a great person. i cant speak for her but for me it expressed a feeling of appreciating small things  g
Often it's just our strengths, we have a lot of crossover but there are certain things that one of us might just be better at. Sometimes its pedals. Our pedal set ups are different to not cover a lot of the same tonal ground. Like John can get more in your face overdrive than I use so he might play a big soaring melody that needs to pop out. I might play something that needs the sound of whatever guitar I have. We do swap parts sometimes if a part isnt working to see if that makes things click - Ed
Rainbow-S
combo  g
we've recorded in recording studios before -- a lot of apple o', offend maggie, bits of reveille, and all of love-lore. but we've never finished a record in a studio before. we never gave ourselves just two weeks start to finish. it was super terrifying and very fun  g
I like Saigon sandwich Tofu Bahn Mi  in SF!-S
>he date la  Oh, yes, of course!  Every time.  The one that comes to mind immediately is the one we just came back from:  Y Noodle in Providence.  YOW!  So good.  Can't recommend the veg ramen enough. -- J
usually we do that to make the melody louder is it isn't enough with satomi singing by herself  g
I believe all told, we have fluent Japanese and English, some semi-competent Spanish, and highly problematic German and French.  We can say food-related words in several other languages, but that doesn't count. -- J
what is the god snare  if by god snare you mean my current snare then yes you will see it again and again
>melody  Hey!  It's one of the new Harmony Comets.  I LOVE IT.  We recorded our album with it, then played one show in Minneapolis, and after the show, while I wasn't on the stage, it apparently fell and the headstock broke off.  But my brother-in-law fixed it for me, and it's good as new, probably stronger than before, actually, so it's got a new lease on life.  -- J
Try on a real guitar and drums?-S
I would suggest having friends hold instruments up in front of you while you're doing it and seeing what happens -- J
That would be especially difficult as not even one of us lives there anymore!  I love New Mexico, though, and part of my heart is definitely still there.  - J
I will! I put up a few songs on our site and have No One Asked To Dance almost done, I'll get to more soon!  - Ed
>Just wrote this to someone else but in case you missed - Just write as much as you can. Use everything you learn. If you play guitar and learn a chord, move that chord all over the neck. Try a bunch of different rhythms. If you play drums and come up w a beat, try playing the bass drum where the snare is, try removing notes, removing a limb, just get creative with how you approach what you already know and what you learn. The goal is to learn how to be yourself and find what is unique about you and to do that you need to investigate and push your brain and creativity into unfamiliar areas. Get away from the cliches and find out what is inside of only you - Ed  To add to that, personally i write a lot of guitar parts on keyboard because then I write what Im hearing in my head and avoiding muscle memory and where my hand wants to fall on the neck. - Ed
Hey, Cadywhompus -- Thanks!  As for breaking out of boxes in terms of structure/form, I think one thing you can do is just generate a really strong awareness when you're working on the song of when your focus starts to drift.  Maybe the first time a part happens, that doesn't happen until 10 times through the part, and the second time you're ready to change after 4 times.  There are no rules that everything has to be the same length.    As for pushing out of comfort zones, I think for myself I've just found some tools that help me not get bored of what I'm doing.  Sometimes it's writing with an instrument that is kind of janky.  All the material I wrote on Miracle-Level was written on a tiny little half-broken ukelele-sized 6-string guitar with terrible intonation.  The fact that it isn't clean keeps my brain interested, and the different range attracts me to different kinds of tonalities/chords.   -- J
someone took my notebook from the stage at the end of a show once. it had the setlist but i'd also been using it for months to write down song ideas. i felt sad  g
Honestly, the only thing I kind of wish I wouldn't have gotten rid of is the first guitar I bought for myself, a Carvin electric.  It's what I used for my first few years in Deerhoof, and I developed a hatred for it, but in some ways it's the guitar that I was most comfortable with -- the placement of the volume knob was really great, really easy to pick and control volume, etc.  Anyway, I have a slight nostalgic twinge for that instrument but otherwise not really.  -- J
I did get a guitar stolen out of my friends truck in Minneapolis back in 1992, it was an Ibanez 580b woodgrain tele with a locking tremolo. I was more into shredder guitars like that when I was younger but I had JUST bought it and it got stolen so I didnt get to enjoy it. But I have about 30 other guitars to fill the gap now! - Ed
Would be amazing, we love Chris!  -- J
Thank you so much for writing.  It's so strange and incredible to believe that we've been with you in some way for these moments in your life.  I know that downhill feeling sometimes.  I wish you the best, and I am so glad you've found something in our new record!  It's been such a trip playing these songs for the first time for people.  We have struggled a bit on this tour, trying to figure out what they mean in front of people, how to calibrate, etc.  Anyway, all the best, and arigatou to you, as well -- J
doitashimashite. deerhoof has also been a very lucky thing for us to have experienced!  g
haha that never happened  it's funny you bring him up though we met him in providence, where he moved from, and we are in providence again right this moment, typing. show starts soon!  g
John Dwyer and I had a jam session just the two of us in a closet in East Oakland in 1999.  It was very fun, and then we never played together again hahahaha!!  It's always fun running into them out in the world . . . -- J
Fushitsusha-S
i loved the biwa player in Kwaidan  g
Oshiripenpens- J
Haha, not much! But I need leave in conditioner otherwise I'd look like a frizzy insane mess - Ed
>with  Oh, I have no idea where to start.  Maybe the Magic is fun?  I don't know why, but that just came to mind.  Funny you bring up Odyssey.  I was just thinking the other day about when Chris played me the chords for that, before any of the melody or anything was written, and it was so incredibly obvious it was going to be brilliant.  I love that song. -- J
hollow bass, flatwound strings, turn up the high mids, a little distortion  g
Hi Travis! See you in Chicago!
Travis!  Look forward to seeing you in Chicago!  Glad you're digging the new rec . . . -- J
miss you travis!  g
i played that. DI guitar through some plugin!  g
Honestly, I don't even know who played that.  That might be Greg?  And if so, I'm assuming it's a Danelectro through a practice amp, but it sounds NOTHING LIKE THAT.  I have no idea. -- J
That was such a cool night.  I remember there was a mosquito issue, but other than that, it was an amazing experience! -- J
That music was originally written for a live soundtrack we did for a Harry Smith film called Heaven and Earth Magic as part of the San Francisco International Film Festival -- I think it was 2006?  There were other bits and bobs that didn't quite make it into Look Away, but it's most of the new material that went into it.  It started on guitar and went from there, yes.  So cool you saw that performance!  We only did it three times, I think, and then the pandemic hit.  Hopefully it'll happen again.  Thanks for listening!  - J
1 theres no system. sometimes ed or john or satomi comes up with the drum part. sometimes the drum is the first thing and sometimes it's an afterthought. im not sure
2 i think i can safely say on behalf of everyone in the band that songs really might come from anywhere  g
some rough lyrics about the milk man that we never refined, necessitating that it be turned down  g
When we play the east coast I borrow gear from our sound person Deron. That's his Electra, not sure of the model. - Ed
This time we ran the mics through other amps instead of recording that signal direct. Also it all happened at high volumes. We were in an isolation booth and there was a drum room between that and a main room where the amps were. When we would crack the soundproof door the amps would scream w feedback from the volume of the mics on the guitar. Amazing! - Ed
The difference on this one was that we took the miked guitar outputs and ran them into guitar amplifiers in another room with distortion, etc.  So, it wasn't just using that close up microphone sound but rather turning it into an electric sound, if that makes sense?  -- J
I absolutely know him and i have all sorts of feelings going way back  - Ed
> uncertai  Hey, thank you!  Pros of studios are the ears of some talented folks that aren't in the band and the gear they are very capable at using.  Cons are that it can be prohibitively expensive which then means you have to work faster than you might otherwise work.  There are definitely positives and negatives to both ways of working, and I don't think one's better than the other, they just create different outcomes.  We've done some soundtrack stuff -- we did Justin Theroux's first film that he directed, called Dedication -- and we've done some other things, including a live soundtrack to Harry Smith's Heaven and Earth Magic. -- J
I am sorry to hear that. Hope nothing is serious. Get well soon!-S
no but we recorded that all together in ed's basement. it was meant to be demos but we decided to use them. so all the mics are picking up the other mics. drums are coming through guitar pickups which were going through amps. we recorded Devil Kids in the same basement. very cramped  g
Just write as much as you can. Use everything you learn. If you play guitar and learn a chord, move that chord all over the neck. Try a bunch of different rhythms. If you play drums and come up w a beat, try playing the bass drum where the snare is, try removing notes, removing a limb, just get creative with how you approach what you already know and what you learn.

Hi, MootBrute2 -- I think my suggestion would just be to not be too hard on yourself.  It's really hard to get started on learning how to floss every day, much less trying to develop an artistic practice.  Have fun with it and do it when you're inspired!  Allow yourself to feel joy and laugh.  Music can be so many different things.  I spent a lot of my life feeling inadequate compared with my heroes, but at some point I realized that everybody wants the best for everyone else, and the best thing you can do is try your best to dig into your own ideas, your own inspirations.  And I also cannot recommend finding a friend or two to play with.  They'll make you feel better when you're having a hard time, and the highs are higher, too.   Best of luck, and I can't wait to hear where it takes you!  -- J
dont be shy to sing out loud to your friends and yourself. write down or record every single idea no matter if it seems good at the time no matter if it is 3 in the morning. no matter if the idea doesnt seem to make sense or seem realistic at the time. ideas are special and fun, dont take them for granted, they will sometimes be seeds that grow into something  g
Hahaha, I had to come up with a name on the spot a few days ago for a record I mixed, and the studio has now been christened . . . Strawberry Macaroni Studios!  It's kind of not a real studio, though.  Feel free to DM me on Deerhoof's Instagram and I'll get back with you. -- J
thats a tough one! the list would be a mile long. i learned to play by playing along with charlie watts so even when im not thinking of charlie i know full well that i am playing like him. snare always a bit late. my main inspiration is whoever is playing with me, i just listen to them and react! lately i have been going back to ed blackwell and tony williams and roy haynes, becaue ive been trying to learn to play a little more quietly
Merci beaucoups!  This is so sweet.  As for things we like to do, there's a lot, but the first that comes to mind is cook.  We like to hang out in the kitchen with each other when somebody's cooking and shoot the breeze.  -- J
Thank you! I like watering plants 🌱 in the morning-S
I think if I could only have a few things I think I'd take an archtop guitar and as many strings as I could fit in the life boat. That could be a happy life. - Ed
oof ten years! i listened to a great deal of music in ten years! wouldnt even know where to start  g
That was mostly recorded in my bedroom in Oakland!  But we also did some overdubbing/reamping for a day at a studio in San Francisco, Tiny Telephone, which was great fun.  -- J
roland electronic drums
I actually answered this one below, but YES, we have played it live.  A couple of years ago, we performed that whole album along with the percussion group Tigue.  It was SO FUN, and I hope we get to do it again.    Big fan of Paradise of Replica!! -- J
that would be so fun. i liked get back by peter jackson. i bought the dvd. manila was unforgettable. what a show. in a shoe store!  g
I dont, I think the normal tuning of the guitar is really interesting and perfect. I do have a guitar that I keep all tuned to one note though for recording so if I do a melody i might play it with that, all barred across the neck on one fret. Or i might take a chord and play each note on the guitar and record them all. The end of Midnight The Stars and You is done like that, its 4 or 5 guitars spread out each playing one note of the chords. If Im recording and a part is a stretch I may retune to make it easy to get a good take. But when I play live or write its always in standard tuning - Ed
I like using alternate tunings when I'm recording sometimes so I'm able to get at chords that I'm hearing that I can't physically quite do without tuning.  So it's like I start with regular tuning and then if I need to raise the B to a C and lower the A to a G# to get a particular chord going, I'll do that and then not worry too much about performance.  One of the nice things about having two guitars in our band is that between the two of us we can usually find a way to cover just about anything . . . -- J
very many! but not as a way to share it with bandmates, just as a way to remember the ideas, like i have notebooks filled with melody ideas etc  g
Depends -- Is it the crispy delicious kind?  What kind of sauces we talking about?  -- J
perez prado samples on the trouble with candyhands and theres that grin
Oh no!  I hope you heal well, we'll be sending the vibes out.  See you next time, I hope -- J
I’ll rock twice as hard on your behalf!
i was at my parents house the other day helping them clean out their garage and my dad pulled that wristband out of a keepsakes box! couldnt believe it. "friend opportunity"  g
> I think)   I'm guessing that would have been for the Friend Opportunity tour, so it probably said Friend Opportunity.  -- J
i think you just figured out how we decided the set list  g
thanks, yes playing with other drummers is pretty fun! i did a tape with william hicks, another with max jaffe, two records with zach from death grips
i like ya cut  -g
See you at Opus 40!
Sick, thx! Black pitch was a highlight, much love 💚
Greg, SOB should premiere it!
Cool. So. Corn as a pizza topping?
It's why I love you all!
one of my favorite concert memories of all time is seeing you in Eugene in 2019 (I think), and your bass drum beater snapped halfway through! We also had to hold the drum from sliding away at certain points, what a fun activity haha.
Something like that. Also, I thought I heard an accordion version of “Hotline Bling”.
That’s awesome, I just got a Roland spd-sx that I’ve been looking for cool uses for, this is inspiring some ideas. I hooked up a piano sustain pedal and it works as a makeshift kick, but I’ve been an acoustic drummer for 23 years so figuring out how to incorporate it is an adjustment. Sorry to hear it got stolen, do you have another electric kit you use live or for recording?
Love oogie <3
Oogie ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Hopefully they come to North America soon! :)
very good answer !
Thank you this clears up a lot of confusion for us over at r/deerhoof thank you
I miss it quite a bit, best sandwich in SF honestly.
Haha I meant the snare that looks to be a tom. I’m not sure where I got god snare from
That’s got goldfoils in it right? Been really intrigued by those new harmony’s
Thank you 🙏🏾
I feel the same way about the first bass I ever bought myself, a Peavey Foundation from the early 90s. Not a great instrument by any means, the one I traded it for is better in almost every way... but it was my first one. I sort of wish I'd kept it.
I’ll see you in there! Typing this from a bar in Providence as we get ready to head to the gig 😇
It’s looking amazing! It was good to see you rock again last night.
Brilliant, it is!  You make infectious music, and it is still burrowing into my psyche and hasn’t reached its resting place yet, but I can feel that it’s destined to live in my mind in the way only a tiny fraction of special albums do - I want to say it makes me feel the way Meat Puppets II did when I first came upon that masterpiece 30 years ago or so… so weird, and so warm and richly alive in all of it’s idiosyncrasies!    Thanks so much for your response!  Sounds like my next adventure will be Magic!
Ohhh I see!
Gotcha. Sounds amazing. Very subtle, but altogether incredible
He's the best and so are you. Cheers. Ps Please play Cactus Club next time you're in Milwaukee.
Ugh the pickups are picking up the drums 🤩🤩🤩 what an idea. I’ve always avoided that, now I wanna do it on purpose!
Thank you so much! You are simply one of the biggest inspirations to me as a guitar player and producer. Your album Dieterich & Barnes is absolutely stunning <3 so many hearts
Also I need to say that Ed’s album Fly Away, Come Here…. Please Ed more…. What you did on that was life expanding
ive started practicing a tony williams transcription of "walkin" from Four And More. i can play it at about 1/3 speed right now
Incredible. Dare I say miraculous. You folks certainly know how to record. And it’s so tight!!!
You’re kidding! I love that! You mean the pads that you play with sticks?
I know right!?! Please get in touch with the folks at Hollywood Avondale Cinema, Auckland if you ever come to New Zealand. We would love to have you on our shores. Love your work! NEVER Stop!
Tsaiziki, hummus, and garlic/potato dip. Very crispy. So yea
haha yes!  i had it for so long, i'm so bummed i misplaced it but i'm sure it's somewhere in storage.
OMG that's it!!!! Thank you <3    &#x200B;  Also I appreciate Greg for chatting with me for a bit about Nervous Cop after the show, such a nice dude!
true…but like, why "l'amour stories" (killer track) over, say, "heart failure"?
oh hack yass -- Only freshly cut corn, though.  No frozen/canned nonsense.  I make a corn/green chile pizza that is quite good -- J
i was going to bring my puter up after the ama but maybe i should just let it run?
yeah what happened to that one? deron our front of house live sound engineer found that for me and i used it for ages. i think it was maybe just too loud. always looking to become quieter. lifelong quest
Yeah, goldfoil humbuckers.  Fantastic pickups, I'd never had a guitar with goldfoils before.  Chimey but still full and warm and not muddy. -- J
Is this an Iowa thing?
Then, no, it is therefore too delicious, and I am still full of vegetable ramen, and it could cause problems.  Thank you anyway.  -- J
thank you  g
it's a good question. i don't know. someone calls out a song and we try to figure out how it went from the record. we try to play it. if it works we keep doing it! a lot of them don't work. we did used to play heart failure, when apple o' was new, but it's been many years!  g
Sounds like a taco that studied a semester in Italy.
/r/PizzaCrimes
thats sick. whichever of you shouted "magnificent bird" is a legend. that was earth shattering in philly and also every other context of its existence
"have you ever been cruel" is a Fugazi lyric, but if this was a Fugazi-related project there's no way it would be on a label other than Dischord
I think it’s a Boy Harsher cover of said Fugazi song (Shut the Door).
Not sure they would create a website and social media for a single cover. Seems like a new band or collaboration.
WaMu is so awful, she came there a few years ago and the prices were as bad as the venue.
Saw Alvvays with Disq a few weeks ago. Incredible show by both bands.
Alvvays please come to Denver as a headliner
Ugh I already went in Boston. Del Water Gap was good but would’ve preferred one of these two openers  Edit: scratch that actually. I got to see New Song live which was worth it
Hey yo, I know I'm not the only one that's noticed it but a lot of artists seem to be writing off touring any cities in the South. Like I get it, but man it sucks being penalized for my numbskull legislators. The reason is political, right?
this is cool, im sure her fans will love this
dang, sweet lineup! saw soccer mommy a few months ago and **highly** recommend!
Waiting for this to happen
I'd love it if she brought Soccer Mommy or Alvvays along to Europe as support, but maybe this European support act is worth looking into too..
Haha I was confused at first - there's a venue in Stockholm called Filadelfia? That's funny.
Yeah, I was interested until I saw that, will probably have to pass on that on. It's a joke of a venue, but unfortunately it's one of the few very large venues in Seattle so people keep having shows there.
Moved to the PNW last year and never been to the venue. What's so bad about it?
Seriously!    They sounded decent at RR last year (opening for TWOD in Sept)—surprisingly so given I expected sound to get swallowed up by cavernous space.   But I've needed a headlining show at Gothic or Ogden, ever since seeing them at Mission (opening for The National Sept 2019)
i can't believe they aren't just playing the ogden! i know touring has become a whole mess for artists, but... i want.
Seeing New Song along would be worth it for me!
RR isn’t that expensive plus you get what you pay for in aesthetics
Rogers is playing Charlotte and Nashville on this leg, and she played Dallas, Houston, and 2 nights in Atlanta on her last leg. That's a pretty standard Southern swing.   Florida gets written off but that's due more to logistics than anything else.
Moving from NC to FL has been so tough concert-wise. It’s a live music desert down here.
I don't think it's political. The whole point of a boycott like that is to make it known. I think it's more based on logistics and cost. I live in Birmingham and we get shows because we're halfway between Atlanta and Nashville.
It’s just a completely flat, massive concrete slab.  It’s worth going to a show to make sure it doesn’t work for you but I’ve never enjoyed it.  There are seats a long ways back but those didn’t appeal to me either.
Ogden would be a dream show (aside from a tiny venue like the Larimer Lounge) but I'd be surprised if they were booked for anything less than Mission.   I have yet to see them live. I had tickets to see them open up for the Strokes in Seattle, but that was in March of 2020 as things were being shut down.
Definitely, RR isn't expensive though
Guh. Yea it's rough out here.
What a bummer! Would still love to see the show but might have to consider the trip to Troutdale instead then.  Thanks!
Shows/venues are continually baffling, but I figured based on recent shows like Unknown Mortal Orchestra (Ogden) and Weyes Blood (Gothic). Tennis headlining Mission is crazy, but it's "hometown show."   Alvvays & Alex G "[Summer Tour](https://www.stereogum.com/2215127/alex-g-alvvays-tour-dates/news/)" could play there. They're certainly bigger than Future Islands and Goth Babe (I think??)—but not quite at level of M83, Pixies, Caroline...
I’m in Seattle but I would drive to troutdale just for Edgefield over wamu. I don’t *hate* wamu but Edgefield is special. Get there early though or the parking can get nuts, and also if you want a choice GA lawn spot. (I know this is heretical, but you may even consider leaving during the final act’s encore if you want to get out of the parking field in less than an hour.)
We're getting Troutdale tix and that seems like the perfect venue for her. If you can swing it it's outdoors and great energy!
Yea I consistently over and underestimate artist popularity, which I think is made more difficult by Denver's market. M83 seems too big to play Mission, Death Grips doesn't seem big enough, Blues Traveler plays Red Rocks every 4th of July??  Alvvays at the Ogden doesn't seem far-fetched, I'll be first in line for tickets. It's the best-sounding venue, imo.  edit--oh yea, boygenius at Red Rocks??
