AFAIK it does but only if cast from dragon communion seal since it has arcane scaling
Well that was the seal i was planning to use anyways so that works for me
Probably.
just chillin' in the tub
Assuming you’re still early game, Caelid. If not then subterranean shunning grounds or consecrated snow fields. These other two options are mid-game areas that you can’t access till during and after lyendell capital
Alright thank you and I pass caleid since:)
Take the elevator
if i remember correctly, it's thru a portal, u find it on the right side as at the top of a fallen pillar, on which there is one of those ancestral archers. I know the enemy but i'm not sure you want me to spoil that for you.
You can find him from going through siofra river well in limgrave. It would lead you to bottom area of nokron. Then you can find him after taking a teleporter on a broken pillar
Lol no clue where that is
No idea what he's talking about. You can parkour down some ruins to get there.
Bleed itself was not nerfed, though some related stuff was like dual wield status buildup. Your setup hasn't been changed at all.
You are imagining things.  Bloodhound Fang with bleed grease has only been buffed, since Curved Greatswords got faster attacks and less recovery.  Dual weild status build up got nerfed, as did Sepuku, and swarm of flies spell. But bleed in general did not get changed at all.
Yes there should be a way to set password only for your team
Guidance in what way? It's hard to imagine you don't know the core stuff like how to make a build, how to play, etc. What exactly do you need help with? Progress isn't very explicit.
If you’re asking where to go after the first two bosses, you head over to rays lucaria academy however you’ll need to find the key to get in
What questions and guidance were you looking for answers for? I can likely answer anything.
Well to put it simply, elden ring is an open world game while the soulsborne games are very linear. I just need to know which bosses to fight, where to go, what weapons to get, I really don't know much about the game
Where do you find the key?
I like the other souks games cause they are very linear so I basically know exactly what to do and where tk go but elden ring doesn't hold your hand, which I appreciate, but I literally don't know anything about the game other than it has some dope bosses
Where do I go? What bosses do I fight? Where do I find good weapons and ashes of war? How can I make progress and progress the story further. Farming methods, like I said I'm an elden ring noob. I'm not used to open world type games but I wanna beat elden ring really badly and I'm almost finished with ds3
"I just need to know which bosses to fight, where to go, what weapons to get, I really don't know much about the game"  Well, the fact it's open world means it's meant to be explored. You can just pick a direction and start running and you may find something worthwhile. That's what I'd suggest doing- you only get a first playthrough one time afterall, why not just play the game and experience it blind? If you really just want forced direction, >!go to stormveil for main progression. That's where the first shardbearer is located. Then after that, the Academy of Raya Lucaria in the region you get to after stormveil. By then you should more than understand how to get around the map and what to do.!<  But heading directly for the legacy dungeons is a surefire way to struggle. You're not really meant to do that. You gotta explore to find upgrade materials, new weapons, armor, etc. Look for caves, ruins, etc.
Spoilers ahead   >! You will find the key behind a resting dragon in northwest liurnia. Look for two island land masses next to each other within the main lake !<
So, after killing Margit and Godrick, head down the stone path on Godrick's boss room, into the building at the back. Make your way through there, and you'll come out in an area called Liurnia of the Lakes. You'll want to explore a LOT, there's a ton to be found and gained, and NPCs to be met. Once you've reached the Academy Gates, you'll want to find yourself a special map, then use it to locate a key. For now, the Academy is your next primary objective. For early farming, make sure to use every Summoning Pool you come across, the small statues with the upwards facing crescent at the top, and use your Small Golden Effigy to send your summon sign to any summoning pool Nearby, or every one you have ever activated, Nearby and Far. There are a few farming methods available to you, but YouTube can explain them much better than I can here.
So once I unlock the academy gate town, will that progress the story?
Okay so correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like there really isn't a "set" path in elden ring? Should I just pick random bosses to fight? Obviously there's a story, so should I focus on progressing the story or fight random bosses?
Most of the better farming methods either require a lot of practice and setup, or are open to you in later areas.
Yes, the next story boss is inside the academy
My Number One Tip for Elden Ring is: Head for every big tree with gold leaves, explore every cave, check every cliff. In short, EXPLORE EVERYWHERE, KILL EVERYTHING.
With the sheer size of the world, I'm almost 500 hours in and still haven't finished exploring everything. It's absolutely worthwhile to experience the world, and let the story progress as you come to it.
Maybe I'm just impatient but I honestly just wanna experience the story and lore and fight some of the hardest bosses. Ik thats not really good to say in an elden ring subreddit but I just wanna beat the bosses. The world is cool but the bosses are cool to, maybe elden ring isn't the right game for me
You can't get to Malenia without some side questing, so you'd do well to look up a straight up guide. For now, let me give you a set of objectives to progress the story quickly.  1. Get to Raya Lucaria, defeat Rennala. 2. Find Fort Faroth and Fort Haight, and collect both halves of the Dectus Medallion. 3. Use the Grand Lift of Dectus in the far North of Liurnia. 4. If that sounds tedious, find the Ruin Strewn Precipice in the North of Liurnia, by staying in the lake while heading north, until you find the valley that leads to it. 5. Head to NorthWest Altus Plateau, to find the Draconic Tree Sentinel and kill him. 6. Enter Leyndell.  It's pretty straightforward for a while after that point.
Sounds good.  Hopefully I don't sound like I'm hating on the game, I think elden ring is fucking dope. Me personally, I like to have more direction in my games then to be dropped jn a world left to explore on my own. Like how do I know which enemies to kill? What if I srumble across an area way too hard for my level. It's just not as clear as let's say Dark Souls where it's very clear what to do. Kill the boss, go to the next area, kill the next boss. Etc etc
While that's fair, also keep in mind that it is very easy to wander into the Catacombs or New Londo in DS1, right off the jump.
Yeah you're right about that, ds1 was pretty masterful in its world design, and honestly I just followed a walktheough for some of it and once I learned every area I basically knew what to do and so on
Yeah, it was like that at the launch of the game too.  Waifu aside, Ranni's questline is arguably the most complete and direct one in the entire game.
I feel like the game almost leads you towards her ending than the default one
Further proof that she's the real ending of the game. Technically according to her lore she's also the beginning of the game too
Was it really, I'm pretty sure it was not since i 100%ed the game a few days after launch and I remember the normal ending being the most achieved one.
Spoilers ahead   >!After giving ranni the sword you need to head over to the other life west of rannis. There should be a teleporter there that will take you where you need to go!<
Did you speak with [the doll](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Miniature+Ranni)?
PvP or PvE?
Had the same question for a while. Specially because people insisted on "fashion over armor".  I disagree with that because it is false for lower levels. On lower levels I would say yes. Armor matters. If you are new to these games I also would say yes. Because every bit of armor helps. Also depends on the place you are in the game. Because people complain about rot or poison, yet there are different armors that can negate certain pains in the ass.   Now I personally figured out what those people mean. Because after inreached level 100ish I find that indeed armor is not that big of a deal anymore. You have good stats and charms now so the little extra of the armor does not really matter only in crucial spots like bosses or areas.    So my conclusion is that in lower levels it does matter. In higher levels not so much.
Armor matters. You don't have to min/max it, but wearing heavier stuff with higher defense makes a noticeable difference. Poise is important too. 51 poise allows you to shrug off a lot of weak hits, while anything less than that is virtually useless.
Light load increases rolling invincibility.
IMO, does not matter that much - Talismans, incantations, meats and aromatics work better generally with damage negation.  Where they do matter is if you want high poise to go toe-2-toe with a foe.  A few pieces have buffs, like Rapotor Black Feather (jump attack buff), White Mask (bleed buff), Black Knife chest (silence/sneaky buff), Mushroom (poison resistance) etc.  Most people just take the pieces with the highest damage negation while still having a medium roll.  Personally, I like to just wear whatever is fun and don't worry about what they do - antlers with lights are a must for me.  I would certainly say do not rely on it to protect you - learning how to evade is way more important and effective. There are 'tank builds', but the protection comes from two greatshields and the armor really is only giving you the poise bonus.
PvP, most certainly yes. You don't wanna get stun-locked by opponents so you need that poise.  PvE, for me personally, no. Since most bosses like Malenia could kill you in seconds, you might as well prioritize light-load dodging and go for lightweight armors.
For pure survivability, low level, armor helps. Late game not so much as vital since you'll have late game talismans and vigor to make up for lesser armor.  In some niche cases armor will help you meet stat requirements.  If you can dodge everything wear what you want. Don't forget about the advantage of light rolling vs medium rolling. Light rolling help you travel further on a roll which will generally make dodging easier.
It depends on your build. Which do you plan to do the most. Block-counter, roll-dodge, tank-hit, or ranged-attack? Depending on your style you may choose armor or no armor at all. For obvious reason you may choose no armor at all for light roll where is you might go full heavy armor for tank/block. In any case at some point you either become too good or too experienced to care about armor and choose some Elden Bling.
The game looks just fine to me, what doesn't look right to you?
The game looks grainy or too sharp, I'm not sure how to describe it, my specs are gtx 1660 super, i5, 16gb ram
Hmm, did I never look up and not notice the clouds were red?  ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sweat_smile)
yes.
I play on Xbox One it also looks grainy, but still love it.
The video doesn't show how it really looked in my screen, it was something with the anti aliasing that make the game look like having a sharp filter on it. But its fixed now
I noticed. That’s weird.
It's AA problem. Just Google it based on your GPU.  On NVIDIA I used maxed out settings with Forced FXAA in Nvidia panel.  It basically, gives you you double anti-aliasing, while FXAA will make the image blurrier, to negate the effect of sharpening
Different time of day
That's what clouds do during sunset.
I see I see, well I'm sorry I wasn't able to help but I'm glad you have fixed your issue, I hope you enjoy the game and have fun, enjoy!
Yes thank you, this fixed the issue 😊😊
thank you, I will try it
Still. Damn. Never noticed.
There’s the aspect of the crucible incant that’s similar but I think you’re talking about the banished knight fire breath which isn’t available AFAIK
Sadly nope. I could be wrong but the rune that appears when (some) cast it is the one from the Dragon Communion? So the player version of the attack would be the dragon fire incantation
Dammit that incant/AoW/whatever they are using looks awesome... thanks for letting me know
Sad...
Try r/patchesemporium for online help ASAP.
Not 10+, but I think i have an unupgraded one over
I need +10 I’m sorry
Save is directly to account you used to play, so if you played it on your account it will still be there.  If you played on the account used for gameshare then the save will be on that one
What are you playing the game on?
So I still log in through my account the game is just shared
Xbox
Loved playing both, and both are very effective.   Strength Faith just edges it for me, as there are slightly more weapons that fit with strength.
Pure faith. Weapons do just fine with sacred/flame art affinity, so there's no reason to add another damage stat unless you have a specific weapon in mind with hybrid scaling.
Prefer str / faith.  I like Bestial Incantations and larger weapons.
what i'd do is take a look through a couple faith builds (has str and dex ones mixed in) and see which one looks cool [https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Builds#faith](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Builds#faith)  have one called lightning lancer that is (str / faith) that looks cool, and another called a black knife assassin (dex / faith) that dual wields, but there's actually a bunch of both  but you should definitely watch the paladin (confessor) guide because it covers the archetype and how you can build off of it
Strength Dex and do a black flame build
Dex/str
STR/FTH is easier to build up to and you get a lot of good options for offense and defense.  There's a REALLY good weapon that scales well with DEX/FTH, but it requires farming a specific enemy and the drop rate is low.  The big thing with faith builds though is buffs, specifically Golden Vow, Flame, Grant Me Strength, and the regen spells. As for damage types, FTH boosts fire and holy damage and fire damage is useful throughout the game while holy becomes less effective on bosses later on in the game.  Both are viable but I would recommend STR/FTH, especially since you get tools that scale well like Clawmark Seal.
Plus cypher Pata and coded sword are pretty great pure faith weapons.
Endgame bosses with 80 holy resistance:
Every door you can interact with can be opened somehow.
I don't think that particular door opens but you can get to the room.  Look through the first room on right carefully.
Not one that says "Blocked Shut". The door OP is asking about definitely *cannot* be opened.
I have a guy at lvl 36 with +4 weapons for co-op and I'll get everything from Margit->Redahn, not sure about the somber weapon upgrades but I'd guess at +2 you'd be ok.
I'm level 57 with +8 / +3 and have been doing PvP in Liurnia, Caelid, Siofra River, and Ainsel River.  These areas just happen to be where I'm questing.  [https://youtu.be/XBEfEEq5wZM](https://youtu.be/XBEfEEq5wZM)  Looks like this, in case you want an idea.
So around a lvl 50-60 range, +8 weapons and +3 flasks?
Yes, level 50-60. Basically, post-Renala.  Yes, +8 standard weapon.   Yes, +3 somber weapon.   I think I have 10 flasks at +6.
Nice thank you I'll have to get to this point. Do you generally manage to get stats to use most or all weapons? I'd like to experiment and be able to use neat things in the future.
I’m playing the hero starting class, which starts out with high strength and low dexterity. And I’m keeping him that way, so I’m mostly avoiding weapons with a dexterity requirement.  I do use Radagon’s Soreseal though, but I’m doing the opposite of what you’re asking. I didn’t want to be unfocused and have too many weapon options.  There are definitely enough weapons for me but there’s a lot I’m purposefully not trying to use.  I use mainly use: - Grafted Blade Greatsword - Greataxe - Executioner’s Greataxe - Great Mace - Rusted Anchor - Banished Knight’s Greatsword - Arbalest - Clawmark Seal - Beast-Repellent Torch
Black Flame Tornado
Cragblade and braggart's roar. If keen gives you significantly more damage than standard affinity at your level, it's worth applying it with whatever ash of war is available.
What weapons? Not all ashes can go on all weapons.
+1
Do good content that people want to watch.  There are plenty of youtuber still doing great with ER content. Mainly challenge runs. Like GinoMachino , LilAggy. Star0chris, Skumnut, Bushy etc.
I am not sure what you are asking?   Do you mean you want more people to subscribe to the ER channels on YT, or not enough people comment positively on their videos or something else?   What makes you say they don't get enough love? What is the data behind that?   I don't disagree, I am just not sure where you are coming from and what you mean?
This. Everyone was like level vigor but lol i went entire ng with paper armour (moonveil pseudo build) and like no more than 30 vigor. In fact it wasn't until ng++ that i got 50 vigor, but that was because my stats basically hit dmg cap. it was far more important to be able to dodge and punish then have any build.
Thy dedication befits a crown.
Yeah.  If you don’t select new game+, you just keep playing on your save. (You can select ng+ later at the roundtable hold)  If you select new game+, your character will have all its stuff, but you’ll get sent to the beginning of the game and your previous save will get deleted  If you select new game, you’ll just make another fresh character in a different save slot.  Hope that helps
Yup
If u go in NG+ u can't come back.  But you are not forced to go NG+ after u beat last boss and choose an ending, you'll be asked if u wanna keep playing or go NG+
thanks
Good for u, mang
Ggs
When the health was so low why not use a bow or crossbow
Going to be honest, first playthrough, out of arrows, no clue where to find em, only played the first dark souls.I still got the runes and everything tho but I just assumed the beams would die too? My plan failed me here... Half way?
Inexperience and panic.  I mean the dude is fighting one of the easiest enemy to dodge on foot , on torrent for some reason.
 With it being your first play through just enjoy the experience. You will die a lot and also more importantly learn a lot. Keep up the training tarnished.
Funsies :⁠-⁠) And drunk And yeah, kinda, very inexperienced. I enjoyed fighting him on torrent tho, did it with Agheel too Just like horse back
Lmao, absolutely loving, I suck yeah... But fucking love it.
Go to NG+ , also jeez man, this game already gives you 5x the respecs of Dark Souls 2/3 AND character customization at any time and you are still not decided what to use.  Just play the game. 60 vigor, enough end to use armor u want, enough stats to use weapons/spells u want. It is that simple.
Oof. If you are just cleaning up you can just bear with it and then go to NG+ where you can get back to respeccing in no time  or you can start a new game and use r/patchesemporium to either mule or trade to give your new character a head start.   If the build is viable just different than you want then I say take it as a challenge. Then again starting a new character off with good gear is fun.
Tis good.
I dig it
Do something about them talismans
I didn’t like sorceries but the int weapons are actually really fun and the host mirror is a flex spot but I do coop a lot so I typically just leave it on
What's that ram horn one?
50 int 40 dex plus radagon s icon
I don’t get it what’s so bad
It increases poise, 51 is what you should typically aim for
Wut is radagon icon for?
The only one thats actually effective for your weapon is shard of alexander also why aren't you using spells with that high ass int?
icreased cast speed, if ypu wanna take some of the int and put into faith for combos
What other talisman would I equip for damage? The sorceries were just boring to me and they take too much fp for mediocre damage honestly
I’m not using spells tho I just like the int weapons
 crimson talisman+2, erdtree+2 favor are good ones.
Well if your rocking the moonveil, equip the stargazer heirloom for more intelligence. Simce thats what the moonveil primarily scales off of. I would need more info about your build. Starting class?
ye if you going for pvp you missing out on tons of true combos
Yeah but i feel like the crimson seed is more hp in the long run tho
Astrologer
Nah I don’t like fighting DIO tbh
Set up your talismans so you can quick swap between the jar shard and crimson seed.
What other weapons do you like?
what
My fav weapon in the whole game is great stars but for int the death poker and the glintstonr kris is very fun
I was talking about the insane lag it feels like ur opponent stops time and u can’t do much about it
Okay i would take str down to 15 and dex to 18, throw those into intelligence as well, for 73 total intelligence, with stargazers heirloom your at 78 intelligence, rock the imp head cat for +2 int and your at 80 total. Im not sure if youre stopping at 150 or you care about drip, but thats how i would max out the int damage for your build.
oh   just get better wifi i guess  but if you only play pve just get ovrlvel then
There are theories, but she doesn't get a lot of in-game references, so it's mostly speculation. My favorite theory is that it is Melina.
>So do we know much more about the her other than her defeat by Malikath and she being the one who controlled the godskins?   Besides this one, we know she is also an empyrian for the greater will. Either a contender for the vessel of elden ring besides Marika, or a contender to replace Marika, not sure of the timeline there. Also that she weaponize destined death with her black flame before Maliketh locked it away, and black flame is a shell from its glory day.  Her chance of being in future dlc is extremely high, this kind of a character that mentions a lot in a lore but didn't appear is exactly the type that plays a big role in the dlc or atleast become a big boss. See ludwig or artorias.
Theory’s are more than welcome :)
I imagine her as sort of a Lovecraftian great old one in that she was the thing that existed before the "gods" came to the lands between because all we really know is off that weapon. She was killed by Marika's brother Malikath which presumably needed to happen to bring in Marika's reign.
Well considering a certain cutscene...it's not a theory.
Maliketh wielded Destined Death and he isn't the GEQ, so Melina saying she will use DD at the end doesn't make her GEQ for sure, but yes I think it's most likely her
Talking to iji or any of the NPCs is all optional for ranni. How far the quest are you? Have you beat radahn? Been to Nokron? The platform can only be accessed after defeating a certain boss.
I didn’t know that npcs were optional In her quest, this saves a loooot of wasted time, thanks
Yep. Other than when you first joined her services you don't have to talk to the other NPCs at all and can complete her quest.
Seriously thanks a lot, every guide I see neglects this fact and after two posts today someone finally clears up that all of these weird changes that happen when you start this quest after beating radahn can just be ignored. Thanks
Umm it’s the valiant gargoyle twins
Cemetery Shade might be low HP but he can kill you pretty easily, the rest are meh
So I run a Daenerys build on a new character. Use a mule to have an extra Dragon Communion Seal. Twink her out getting some easy dragon hearts, spells, and runes. Remember Patches. The left, right, left, right of the dragon hand dual DCS was so fun and powerful that the bitch ass Patches, the only boss who gives up halfway through the fight, has surrendered and died before I remembered I shouldn't kill him.
I don't interpret 'bitch ass' as easy. Radahn is the biggest bitch ass in the history of From imo. His moveset is trash. His armor is a joke. His little horsey looks dumb as \*\*\*\*. I don't care about the lore, he is an absolute dumpster fire of a boss.
The Demi-Human Queens
Yes definitely the easiest boss fight in the game
“Bitch ass” as in easiest
The last patch added ray-tracing, which is a massive hit to performance.  Have you checked your settings?
Yes it ran well even with it enabled and when the crashes started I turned it of. Ran well for about 30 hours as well
Idk then.  I've been playing on PS4 since release, and the only issue I have is in that cathedral where you get Rivers of Blood.  I get a MASSIVE particle spike, and my fps drops to 15-20.
Performance really isn’t a problem for me it’s only the constant freezes I get now. I just started playing and fell in love immediately so this sucks
Nope, you have to go downstairs. The message did not prevent you to enter there, you are just not supposed to go in from there after you triggered the boss fight.
There are some fogs specifically for that boss that won't let you in. There is one down half spiral staircase that will let you in.
No, you have to use one of the other doors to access the fight for some reason.
Nah only the very first time you can go in from there. You can enter from the fog down the staircase to your right, however I recommend making your way to the dragon temple transept grace. From the dragon temple grace you turn away from the doorway and jump down to the staircase, then turn around and jump down again. Fight a couple knights and turn left and there’s another grace. From that grace you can enter the boss fight without having to deal with the knights every time
pretty sure it’s cuz of the message in the middle of the fog if not then idk
Yeah this one is confusing there are a few entrances but only 2 of them work to start the battle
u are at the ceiling of boss room u can jump down first time  but then fogwall prevents you have to go from their frontdoor
Thisbproblem got updated early on. It now gives you a option to choose a different action when a message is in the way.
I think a lot of people (myself included) are like this but a lot of people take it as "asking reddit to google for me" but it's just nice having a person on the other end imo
My 1st playthrough I refused to use any wikis or guides until I got to the very end before accepting ng+ as I didn't want to spoil anything and to have an organic playthrough, but didn't want to go to ng+ having missed stuff. So I only used the guides at the very end to see what I missed and grabbed them accordingly. I struggled against Maliketh and Malenia but never resorted to guides and was glad I didn't.
I did my best avoiding walkthroughs and wiki my first playthrough, ended up missing important quest stuff and didn’t get the ending I wanted. Regardless I’m glad I did. Made it fun
From soft games are not designed for 1 time run only if you are aiming for lore. Where do you think those wiki pages and articles get their info about lore? In game. If you want to learn all by yourself, you have to read, explore, hear all dialogues etc. Almost impossible to achieve only during NG cycle.
This. I guess the feeling of a person on the other side is important.
Hi there!  I'm the guy who loves diving deep into the wikis and who gets frustrated by questions that could've been answered quickly from a simple search.  I hope you're having a great day:)
>I hope you're having a great day:)  I am :)  Also I understand where your frustration comes from but that's the price we pay for sorting posts by New ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|trollface)
I suppose that's a good point xD   ..I'm just so scared of not doing that.. though, I would get relieved from getting all those obligatory same questions of the day🤔 the ones worse than "how to do this/where to get that" questions, are the "tell me how to build/evaluate these stats" ones - phoey!
Feel free to use this to farm weapons/armors or other items you want.  all base/average item drop rates are pretty easy to farm with this.
Yeah it is pretty dope. When I was helping to co op, followed a lot of other phantoms and they showed me bunch of spots I didn't check. Then I pass on the knowledge for when host wants me to lead.  Once you've been playing for awhile you just know how to wreck all the enemies in a given location. It helps when you can surround and just stunlock the knighta with jump attacks or charged attacks.
Fromsoft PUBLISHED Tenchu they didn’t develop it.
No Kings Field is. Or Demons Souls I guess. I’d say Tenchu is Sekiro’s dad.
Like Tenchu on the ps1?
Yes and 2 apparently.
Have you heard of Kingsfield?
Nay.
Its fromsofts first soulsy game on the ps1. Check it out.
Nobody can know for sure until we get more lore. But I am going to say no, because there is clearly levels of divinity in ER. Elden Beast overpowered Markia even though they are both gods. The Elden Beast is just a vassal of the Greater Will, which is theoretically leagues above them.  Also Markia didn’t kill the Fell god because it was still alive in the Fire Giant. The fire giant was probably the living extension of it though. The Flame of Ruin eternal fire also shows the Fell god is still “alive”.  Outer gods seem to be just masses of sentient energy that are using others as vassals and vessels.
We know that the Rot god was sealed once. I assume they cannot be killed. Hell even the formless mother continues to get injuries whenever ya cast a bleed spell yet that doesn't kill her. I'd find it impossible to believe that anything would come remotely close to the power of the Frenzied Flame or even attempt to kill it.
Just need to have stepped inside it, use the grace for good measure
You need furled bloody fingers or the bloody finger from Varre’s questline. You can do his quest after getting a great rune and talking to him at the blood church in Liurnia. You will get furled fingers and the bloody finger.
That's not the question op was asking.
Please no spoilers I'm trying to play this one blind.
Nice, yes the game teaches you to be more agressive. Slow and methodical works but going on the offensive more has its advantages now.
No spoilers but its so cool they added Gwyn as a secret boss for the hardcore fans.   Jk dude. Chill out. Or maybe not?
Get off Reddit quick!!
Yes, What we know about the erdtrees formation out of the crucible, its definitely parasitic. At the very least its influences in the lands between is out of  a selfish need.
At first I was gonna say it’s not parasitic it’s a god, but now that I think of it it kinda is
I would say so. Ancient civilizations were forced underground (could be pre-greater will, who knows) and the crucible of life lost a lot of its influence
The greater will is the outside influence of an outergod I wouldn't call it a parasite but so far all the outer gods we know about set the par for being assholes. And they should all meet the sharp end of an axe and leave our land in peace before we have to take them to pieces. So says I the UNGA BUNGA lord, And my fellow lords.
Is there any proof of this?  I could see the Elden Beast being parasitic, or the erdtree itself.  How the greater will itself is acting as a parasite seems unclear.
I think its an a entity that transcends outer gods, it is the entity of order, and whatever entity controls the frenzied flame is the counterpart, chaos.   In the end i don't think the greater will gives a damn about what order is established, whether its the golden order, the order of rot, or the order of the moon, as long as there is an order.
I think it'd be horrifying if the erdtree was actually a mushroom that infected the crucible. That the horrible realization of what it is and what it's doing is why Marika set things in motion to try to kill the Elden Beast and burn the Erdtree. From the creation of the Tarnished, to possible involvement with the night of the black knives, the cursing of Hewg, and the battle for power between her children set off by herself breaking the Elden Ring.
The Greater Will is simply a force that believes it to be good for there to be separate souls for each being.   It's very difficult to separate it from the world of ER itself. It's hard to call it parasitic if it's actions caused there to be something to be parasite on in the first place.
Not parasitic, THE ERDTREE could be seen as parasite but the Greater Will couldn't give less of a shit about what happens in the lands between. We must understand that the elden ring and by extension the erdtree are but mere tools of the Greater Will, a being who we cannot even begin to comprehend. We see many forms of the outer gods but that's mere physical manifestation of what they could potentially be for all I know the Frenzied Flame could be an all consuming mouth in the shape of a sun. The formless mother could be a bag of blood from a hospital and the rot god could be an insect (I aay this bc malenia's butterfly symbolism, the antspur rapier and the scorpion stinger)
200% not parasitic lol. Everyone is still convinced that the erdtree is some sort of parasite of the crucible, but it's not true. The crucible and the erdtree are the same thing, just in different ages and called with different names. (If they were different things, why would their incantation crests be the same? Also in Japanese the crucible is called something like "the beginning of the golden tree".  The crucible is basically the erdtree before the rune of death was plucked away by Marika. So there's no tree parasiting other trees.  The Elden beast could be seen as a parasite, since it basically lives inside of Marika.
Yes more specifically the Erdtree/Elden Beast is what I am getting at, sorry for the confusion. But I also assume they are microcosms of the greater will, so by extension the GW would also be parasitic if you think the Erdtree and Elden Beast are, imo.
Yes I should have put Erdtree to be more specific but I think it's still safe to say the Greater Will, as the Erdtree and Elden Beast are products of the Greater Will and most likely the GW is a form of life trying to replicate itself just like every other form of life in existence does.  Being a "God" in this game is used in a relative manner, like humans are gods compared to ants, and I see the same for the outer gods and greater will as just another form of life just on a whole other level
But thats the thing, in what way is the Erdtree a parasite. Sure the order is ass but other than that the Tree itself has been nothing but a blessing to the lands between. The only parasite was Marika who fucked it all up before Ranni made worse. You mention that it could be a life form trying to replicate itself but what if it did and it resulted in the three fingers and frenzied flame a thing that only seeks to return everything to its original state, all life as one single (although burnt) thing. Through the process of creating life it also created its very destruction, chaos itself. There's also Godwyn as a paradite you could say
Well for starters, the Erdtree changed the way people/life died once it took over. Instead of traditional death people were expected to feed themselves (body and soul) to the Erdtree roots, get processed by the Erdtree, then get pooped back out as "reborn". Surely you are aware of this part of the lore? And I think it's safe to say the Erdtree is benefitting from the process somehow
r/beyondthefog
Imo it is a awesome weapon. The question is do you feel comfortable using it's moveset? You can always respec into a build for it then respec back if you don't like it.
No weapon is powerful enough to warrant changing your build to use. If you do end up using the sword, do it because you like it.
if I do decide to respec into it how much int should I get? just enough to use it?
Nah, it’s just another trophy.
If you want to use it, get enough Str and dex to use it and pour the rest of your level into int because Dark Moon Greatsword scales best off int. You can also get yourself a staff and cast magic now that you have high int
Love that intelligence is the stat you left for the end
Which one did you max out first?
None of them
The one at my work.  He’s lactose intolerant, but too large for me to solo.
Do spirit ashes count as help from others? If so then Melania and Maliketh
tbh never been able to beat the elden beast without summons
Niall frags my ass every time
I beat every boss with cheese by over leveling so much the game was easy
Must be nice, I can’t beat those ulcerated tree spirits for the life of me lol
Cheddar? Yeah he’s notorious for that
Does golden vow stack with lord's divine fortification? I was reading about stackable buffs and got even more confused :/
 Please don’t hate me. Understand I come to this with ER being my first Fromsoft game.   I am trying really hard to like DS3 and I’m just … not. I’m at the undead settlement and I have so little desire to continue on. The run back to the boss fights it’s a drag. This entire fucking world is a drag. Why would I even bother bringing the lords of cinder back to their post to link the flame? This world is desolate and destroyed and completely void of anything worth continuing. I hate it here.  Does it get better? Does it get more rewarding? Am I going to like it more if I keep pushing forward?    **Everyone** says this is the best Fromsoft game. ER blew my mind, it has ruined all other video games for me. I came into this with high hopes and it just feels like a grind.   I get why people like the boss combat better. Thus far it is way more balanced and easy to decipher… with that said, my original complaints still stand and I am just feeling no desire to continue on.
Carian knight shield. Do you HAVE to have 15 INT to make this work properly? It is an amazing shield to have especially magic infused.   Are there any detriments when using this shield without the required INT stat? I'm a faith/melee build with 7 INT. It blocks 100% and does block magic well.   Someone said you have increased stamina drain being the penalty for not meeting the INT requirement? Is this true or are there more issues with not having the INT for it?  Good news is I got the alburinauc's shield so if I can't use the carian knights because of the INT this is the next best until I progress.
Im using str/faith build. Is there any good weapon skill or ash of war that deals good AoE damage. All ash of war that I have with good aoe are scaling with int. I want something faith scaling cause I have a lot of faith. I like big weapons btw.
Question for my fellow Tarnished.   I just beat my first playthrough as a DEX/FTH build, pretty much using Bloodhound's Fang and Faith spells. I went for the Age of Stars ending.   My second playthrough on NG+, I'm planning to do the Frenzied Flame ending. However, I want to try a new weapon or two. What are some good options (STR/FTH or DEX/FTH) both Somber and regular? Not Blasphemous Blade/Sword of Milos, I plan to save those for a powerstance if I get truly stuck on something.   I'm not considering an INT build at the time since that's going to be my third playthrough on a fresh character (goal is to get Dark Moon and finally be able to use it, didn't think far enough ahead to realize I could have done Age of Stars on this playthrough and gotten the standard ending for my first run. Might also be the DLC run depending on when that drops.)  Thank you in advance.
Okay I’m really confused but why do people apply the magic def buff for elden beast??? It’s not a lot of people who do it but a good amount of people do it. I’ve been helping people and I just get confused lol.
Yes they will stack.  It’s not explained well. But each buff has a type. You can have one of each type. Golden cow is an aura buff, it buffs your aura. Divine fortification is a body buff. So you can have both active at once.
If you don't like then don't play, I guess? I think it's impossible to make a game that everyone likes. I was not enjoying the game initially but it was really fun after I got ash of wars and more spells.   What do you mean by rewarding?
Thank you!! This should help a lot against >!elden beast!<
I’m not sure if it’s sorted by most recent played at the top
It isn't
How and why do you keep track of #kills. What's your end goal if any
I have the amount of solo kills in my character's name. So, every time I get a solo kill, I just add a tally to my name. I don't think I have an end goal really it's just more of a "my summoning sign will always be outside her door if you need me" kind of thing. I'm just here to help.
I usually don’t care too much but it’s really been annoying me with the Commander O’Neil fight in Aeonia.  They just run straight from the summoning pool and by the time I’m done buffing (physick, crab) they’ve already triggered him to spawn the adds. Then he probably decides to give them a defense buff before I can even kill 1, suddenly doubling the hits it takes to kill each.  What a stupid fight.
Good advice, thanks!
Yes, just don’t summon Ranni at the end of the final fight
They all look the same with exception of Ranni and Frenzied Flame. You only get different captions.
Thank you!
Is Godrick dead?
If you defeat godrick or touched a grace at liurnia of lakes that part of her quest ends.  You can get the seed at stormhill shack though. I don't think she drops anything else.  I've never seen her get stuck standing at the fireplace though. Is that what you are saying? Talking to her and the the blacksmith should progress it so she helps with the spirits. What does her dialogue end with?  Hugh doesnt give you about roderika dialogue?  If so yeah sounds bugged. Afaik you don't need to defeat godrick or anything once she tpss there should be able to progress. Try talking to everyone at rt if you have not already done so to see if it triggers anything.
He is (that's the dragon hand dude, right?)
I ask because, if you've rested at any Grace in Liurnia, returned to the Hold, and spoken to Hewg, you should be able to select the About Rodericka option. If you can't, I'd suggest trying forcing a point of progression for the gamestate, such as killing a Rune Bearer.
Yeah she's standing at yhe fireplace talking about finding a purpose..hewg doesn't have the option
Yes.
Assuming yo exhausted all the optional dialogue for the blacksmith, then see if it appears? If so, might be bugged.
Talk to Hewg more, teleport and come back. Talk to her more etc.
He is dead
Hmmmm... You said she's already sitting across from Hewg, but has her hood up? Was she ever standing next to the Fireplace?
Negative..she is in front of the fireplace
Sorry I should have specified where in the roundtable she was. She's in front of the fireplace, I'm assuming it's the first spot she spawns in at after Storm Hill
Oh, then talk to her, choose Please if it's an option, if not, try talking to Hewg immediately after talking to her.
She doesn't have any options after talking about looking for a purpose. And hewg only have his normal options, nothing progress or lore related
Okay, have you traveled to the Storm Hill Shack and picked up her Golden Seed? That could be preventing the progression flag from ticking.
I have indeed. Grabbed that seed. I've also done a decent bit of progress. Killed the academy boss, made it over to kill the draconian tree sentinel or whatever it's called lol I think he was guarding the entrance to the city that blocks the way to the snow area? Idk that's about where I've stopped, but I pushed that far thinking maybe progress would trigger the proper dialogue..also, I appreciate you helping me troubleshoot. All these suggestions are very welcome 🙏
It was a fun time. 😁
Spinning weapon set to heavy with bloodflame weapon buff.       Rips through enemies with the bleed.
I would use a scythe or death’s poker for a melee weapon. Then go grab all the death sorceries and ghostflame ones.
I just plug in an external HD and transfer everything onto that. Just use the menus in the system section. Then unplug and plug into your new console - easy as. On first starting your new Xbox, use your profile to sign in and everything you had saved in the cloud is automatically transferred including all personal contacts, friends, setting etc. it’s so easy.
When I login with my profile, would it transfer the saves automatically?
Same, you just have to bait out his jump kick tho
Radagon is a fun fight but Elden Beast is so annoying.
Nah elden beast is easy for me though
I wouldn’t say he’s hard, it’s just annoying chasing him around that massive arena. And since I’m ranting, I think he looks stupid as hell.
You probably are not a very patient man
Its been a bit since I've played but I'm pretty sure all of that will reset once you go into NG+, so yeah you'll need to buy it all now if you don't want to wait until you kill them again
Yes.
You will not. The ‘store’ resets and you won’t have access to the Champion’s gear until you defeat that boss again.  You will keep any items you have already purchased.
I don’t get how briar armor set is hero equipment since there’s no lore behind him.
Thanks. Looted.
Funny enough he is a criminal to be executed.
Wonder if there’s more in future dlc. Right now it’s just vague.
In DS3 they did expand lore of some of the bosses in the main game like Pontiff Sullivan and the Dragonslayer armor so it's possible.
Don’t whine about most of these being reposts(to my knowledge)
You can buy them after. Free if you get them through Gideon.
Ah, okay. Thank you for this information!
What console?
r/BeyondTheFog
Ps5 hey
Good stuff didn't see anyone do this before
I hadn’t played in around a month or so prior, so if they did any overhauls, I’m a bit in the dark on it.
Apologies for any formatting or grammatical errors, I wrote this at 4am after learning the Treespear cant be double buffed like fextralife comments said >:(
Dude my tarnished died to a noble with a torch
Kratos win... the first million times... but eventually the tarnished will get lucky I guess
Kratos.  It wouldn't even be a show.
Kratos at first, then he'll get worn down by the Tarnished coming back over and over.
Kratos.
Tarnished can jump as will. That is all I'm saying.
The Tarnished. Easily.
whoever you want to win, since their both fictional
Well the Tarnished does have destined death which fuckings speedruns through your health. Theres also rot, deadly poison. No doubt Kratos would kill the tarnished a few times but we must understand that the tarnished is a being that cannot be permanently killed by any means.
Kratos easy
Kratos easy
Kratos the first few hundred times, until the tarnished would finally get the moveset down. Then Kratos would crawl out of hell with better gear and a new weapon, so the tarnished would uninstall.
Lmaooo
Most accurate answer
Ya, I like to think the characters of Elden Ring can’t even comprehend his power. He’s this foreign god from another dimension.
still found out how to kill baldur after coming back over and over
Duuuude explainnn
That was a prophecy/self fulfilled prochecy though. The Aesir are fated to be killed off, the Tarnished can come back as many times as possible, unless you're any of the Tarnished NPCs we meet. Guess they don't count.
And he himself has come back multiple times.
If it moves, the tarnished can and will kill it.
“Insert name here” was sent back to their world. That’s my head canon for the tarnished we kill or the the npc that invade us especially if you can fight them more than once like Anastasia tarnished eater
They do come back (except Gideon since you kill him after Maliketh), it probably just takes a shitload of time — it’s never stated how long it takes between respawns. If they were hostile to you they probably just stay out of your way hence why you don’t see them again
Sure ig
Sorry I was busy
Thank you so muchhh. Where would you like to meet lol
I can summon you at the frozen lake
If you don’t get an answer here, try the sub dedicated to this type of transaction: r/patchesemporium.
You can remove ER from the title. Game Rant doesn’t make original content about *any* game
Fair.
I think they were trying to convince morgott that a tarnished will be a lord and he didn't like it
I assumed they spoke against Morgott's obsession with wiping out Tarnished before they got to the Erdtree. Or the Black Knife Assassin outside of Marika's bedchamber killed them while trying to get answers as to how to get Marika, who might have been the BKA's leader, out of the Erdtree
I know Jenny and Christina pretty well, but haven’t met the others.
Marika didn't care for the golden order she probably had them come to give her (counsel) on the night she fucked up the Elden ring and had them killed or ranni sent the black knifes to the capital to kill Godwyn and the black knife found them and killed them, it could also have been a joint effort.
To disguise the sleeping black knife assassin
dey ded
It was a bad batch of congealed salad at the luncheon that got them.
>Anybody know anything about all these dead Finger-Reader Crones?  I know they're dead.
They owed me money.
I really like this answer thank you 🙌
Very quality speculation 🔥🙌
The game tells you that Alecto and technically Ranni were the leaders of the black knife assassins. Marika is Godwyns mother and she literally loved him more than any of her other kids and the black knives murdered him
It’s a Tea Party! Clearly the queen wasn’t invited and got tiiiight! 😂
Another Quality speculation! Like the thought of Ranni and Marika being in on the joint effort of Godwyn
Any idea what all those dead ladies might be doing there? Love to hear all opinions honestly
No that's actually just head canon. The game in fact tells you the opposite, that Ranni and the Assassins teamed up just for the Night of Black Knives. And Marika shows no love for anyone in her family. Not her  husbands, not her kids, not her Shadow Malekith, she doesn't even seem to care for Radagon who is a part of her. We habe zero evidence that Godwyn was anything more to her than her first non-Omen child hence the first she felt she could show publicly.
He was set to take her place at vasal to the Elden ring and he was strong as fuck. So I feel like that's why assassin's had to be employed by ranni and given destined death weapons sure they (stole) it but did they really they, the black knifes are push overs with no poise where Godwyn was build like a brick shit house and was loved by the people and the dragons. That and marika is a bitch mom she threw morgott and mohg into the sewer. She was queen and holder of death it's self she didn't have to do that for anyone except herself. And it's not like she didn't know you cant kill outer gods because she killed the gloam eyed queen with maliketh.
I know absolutely nothing about any of the more of anything. 110 hours in and I have no idea what is happening or why.
Environmental storytelling and item descriptions will tell you most things! I read through them and try to analyze the map as I play on my 6th playthrough! It’s fun and can always find something new! This one though I can’t quite explain but I’m sure someone can! Just have to wait and see :)
No
Hah, no. We don't even have such thing not even crossplay (hopefully one day with xbox and ps)
You already bought a PS5 so this is late to the party but I would suggest a Steam Deck if you’re traveling. As long as you have Elden Ring and whatever other games you’re playing on steam (as long as they’re playable or verified) , it Cross saves between your PC and the Steam Deck. Even if you want to play on a tv elsewhere you can get the Steam Deck and a Deck dock and you’re good to go.
So lets buy the game twice and start again? Im 400hr in... Guess ill wait for d4 and "try" Hogwarts (witch I baught and never player yet)
Feeling old asf... what's a steam deck? How can it run games? Got a pretty good pc, how can it support from far appart??
Might as well mate...might as well.
Sad but will do
i may be colorblind but im 99% certain that japanese ppl got black hair
Every Japanese person I’ve met (maybe 3 ) has hair that has been dyed something other than black so you do you bae
Try making it more Japanese and more man.
Looks like the dude that played ~~Jeffrey Dahmer~~ Quicksilver.
He’s supposed to have the beige colored hair I’m trying to figure out the skin tone and facial settings
dude thats pink
Oh shit u right
Sadly it seems there's no way of saving her. :(
She reincarnates? What else could it be?
Wanna see her again, find hyetta
No, you can't "save" her.  That Soulslikes for you.
You can find another npc called Hyetta in Liurnia after completing Irina's quest. Hyetta has her own quest with shabriri grapes and can lead you towards one of the endings.
I’m sure they laugh at all the stupid shit players do with their creation.
Someone would make bank on a robotic hand that delivers a rough handy each time you finish a new elden ring challenge run
Someone has beaten Margit simultaneously with controller and DDR pad on two different systems
Why did the first man to reach the top of Mt Everest reach the top of Mount Everest?  Because it was there, and because he could.
People gotta entertain themselves somehow, to make the game interesting.  I mean for people who think running through the game normally is boring, I'm not one of them.  I kinda suck tbh
Reminds me when they told miyazaki about speed runners and no hit runners and he was just confused about it all lmaoo
Soulsborne vets when they think everything other than leveling STR and using a colossal weapon is «lame».
I like how some people made whole videos ranting about how the game was too hard, needed an easy mode, and that it was impossible to get anywhere without grinding for hours first, then you got people who pick wretch, grab a stick, and dodge through the whole game. Then there are the insane nut jobs who try to make it even harder like that girl who uses a ddr pad instead of a controller.
If I was a game dev making a hard game I’d be sad if someone beat it at level 1 with a early game straight sword because “the game hasn’t been hard enough to feel like he needed to level up”.
LoL
Im struggling on my first playthrough ill go to a area get cooked try again get cooked again an be like i gotta be underleveled asf let me come back but my rivals are crucible knights i hate them with a passion tbh
Why? Because Youtube fame
True 😂😂😂
Oh man, I got a big kick out of this, lol
Lmao
A fromsoft game is the one place this meme doesn’t work. It’s just some heavily reposted shit that could apply to pretty much every other game.
Every Fromsoft game ever be like
"Do you see me devs? Are you proud of me?"  Nobody has ever had this mindset. Did you really have to make a guy up just to make fun of him?
r/onebros you talking of us?
I'm guilty of this lmao. Did most of DS3 at SL1 with no upgrades.  The Sister Friede fight gave me nightmares
Elden Ring?  That's the most FROM thing ever lol
I did bow only and felt like I could conquer the world and then the next person does a blindfolded, lvl 1 hitless bow only run on a piano or something 😂💀 it almost makes any challenge run a normal run now lmao
They positioning of the characters really ruined it
Me: role playing as a peasant that has to reach lvl 20 to become a man-at-arms with nuzlocke rules for my super limited arsenal and only cloth clothing  Nothing weird here at all.
I mean there is a guy who beat dark souls with a bunch of bananas as his controller, so probably.
I once got summoned into some dudes world and him and his friend were cosplaying as Miyazaki and George RR Martin lol. GRRM had the fire prelate chest piece on it was hilarious.
Like beating the game with a ddr mat?
So do I, I’m watching a perma death run and it’s amazing
That's why they make is Soo fucking hard for regular gamers.    If anything like ready player one happened... It wouldn't take five years to find the first key. It'd be like days at most.
There's a number of videos in the past few years of game devs watching people speedrun or challenge run their games. There are a wide variety of reactions, but some seem to really enjoy watching people do ridiculous shit to their games. Others not so much.  One of my favorites is with the [Psychonauts 2 devs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHsiFbHMjO8). Tim Schafer seems to really enjoy seeing what the players have figured out, while the lead programmer seems horrified at how they are breaking the game using tons of bugs he thought had been ironed out, and the lead artist finds the entire thing absolutely hilarious.   Great watch for people who are fans of this stuff imo.
I used to hugely enjoy challenge runs but over time I just got more and more to where PvP is the whole focus.
I love this game lol
I'm not even gonna look this up. It sounds so normal
MissMikka actually finished whole game like this 💀
Same someone beat malenia in the manner later. Crazy.
Fun fact: Mount Everest is named after Sir George Everest, who has no connection with the mountain and told everyone NOT to name the mountain after him because the locals would have trouble pronouncing his name.  His name is actually pronounced /ˈiːvrɪst/ ("EEV-rist").
to acquire the priceless everest rubies perched atop the peak
True but this would be like climbing mount everest butt ass naked
Nah nah, you'll get good eventually. And once you do it's gonna be a fuckin breeze after your nth playthrough. That's when you start seeing the perspective of those challenge runners.
I never ranted about difficulty of any game I ever played, but I do genuinely believe that some people playing games like these perceive the world 0.2 seconds slower than the rest of us
I can think of at least 2 women that have beaten ER with the dance pad on various challenge runs..
Yeah lets take some of the best players out there as an example. Just because some people are playing it within hard challenges cause its to easy for THEM doesnt mean that the game is overall not hard or bad balanced.
no game you can ever make will be hard forever for certain people. with practise everything can become easy, it’s in pretty much every game but the main one that comes to mind is the fact that in overwatch top500 players aren’t allowed to stack together because they devs didn’t plan for anyone to be that good at the game, and letting them stack absolutely fucks over matchmaking
counterpoint: if it's possible to clear as a naked fuck with a stick, it means high player agency, they have control over outcomes  players will feel more inclined towards "it's my fault that i died" than "GOD THIS CHEAP ASS BULLSHIT"  if your game's difficulty comes from numbers and sliders, it's more artificial  ed: oh yeah if ordinary people are doing it casually on first runs then you undertuned some shit, yeah
Which actually has been a thing at FromSoft. The inflation of difficulty since DaS1 has been pretty massive.  More tools are provided to bypass these (e.g. summons, early accessible magic and OP weapons, boss-specific items), but doing it the old-fashioned way means dealing with way more bullshit.
Buy a Buckler off Gastoc in Stormveil castle. It's the easiest tool for parrying. You can also get the Misericorde while in Stormveil, which is the dagger with the highest crit modifier. Aside from that, the regular Dagger sold in Roundtable Hold works well too. Daggers of all kinds have a hidden modifier that gives them bonus damage on crits.   Once equipped with both, practice parrying on the Crucible Knights. You can parry any time they swing their sword with one hand.   This strategy works well for pretty much any humanoid enemy in the game: Bell-bearing Hunters, Kaiden Sellswords, Omen, Knights, Snakemen, Misbegotten, Nox, etc. Even some bosses like Margit and Malenia can be paired, though you typically need to parry then more than once for the riposte window.
If you don’t aspire to be LobosJr what are you doing with your life
You must kill it at parties
Do you feel like this comic strip is a personal attack or?
I agree with you , sadly you are gonna get Perma downvoted , some people in this subreddit say "there is no right way to play the game" then proceed to lash out if someone didn't summon mimic tear on everysingle boss, talk about insecurities.
Sounds kinda cool. Also beating Gods as a farmer with a pitchfork or a lumberaxe is kinda hilarious. Like a bunch of people were fucking around so bad, he had to stop chopping wood to sort this mess out
I wonder what they think about my current johnny sins play through…
Just looked him up, assuming it is the same guy he plays Elden Ring too - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoMsm543W9Y
Both. Both is good.
I wouldnt normally believe this without seeing proof but seeing how someone beat the Abyss Watchers using an actual fucking potato, I believe it.
See, I go the other way.  Once I beat a game now, I like to overpower myself and just relax as I blast through it.  My recent run of DS, I finally used the soul dupe glitch and face tanked all the enemies.  Don't know exactly when I changed though.  Back on the NES, I spent a lot of time doing stuff like wooden or no sword only in Zelda, mega buster only in MM, or no death runs in Contra.
they don't allow top500 stacks because it's miserable for other people facing off against a pro trio dominating every match and that it would also take even longer for them to find games if they wanted to keep it fair matchmaking for groups
With practice, sure. But for a dude to do it on his first blind playthrough? That would kick my ego.
Top players stacking fucks *every* game's matchmaking.  >they devs didn’t plan for anyone to be that good at the game  Doubt it. This is the same company that has made at least 4 games that became successful eSports before Overwatch.
This so so much. I've been spoiled by modern games that give me space to git gud and now when I encounter an unavoiadable mechanic  I ask "what did I do wrong?" and in some games the answer is "you were supposed to grind for the stat wall," and that is a lame answer.
The devs just created options for the players to choose their own difficulty.
Granted it’s obviously just a silly comic but this guys comment isn’t wrong
He probably beat Through the Fire and Flames on Expert and no one saw it.
Especially since Fromsoft has actually directly acknowledged certain gamers like LMSH.
I like the idea that a farmer with a hand axe can obtain enough beef to chop the gods.
I made a Lumberjack run where I only used the handaxe and was always shirtless. Not only was it fun. It was also the only character with which I beat Malenia first try and it will propably be the only one.
Using the Ringed Finger?
oh yeah, but anyone doing that is literally insane and it would still take a lot of practise to the point that by the time you do beat the bosses and such you’ll know plenty about them.
If you think blizzard knows how to make esports in the current year, just look at the multimillion dollar mangled corpse that is the Overwatch league...
'ok you know what I can't die AND the world sucks? Well then how about I fuck up all your runes? Not so funny now is it?'
Make a kinky Dom daddy with whips and you'll beat her again first try
**FINGER YOUR WAY TO THE ELDEN RING**
Tolomeo did his first blind run with only a straight sword without leveling up, think it took him only 2 hours to beat malenia. That man is just talented
Oh I never thought Blizzard was a good company, just using them as an example
We're not even talking about in the current year. Overwatch was released in 2016. The point is that they have plenty of experience with how freakishly good someone can be at a video game.
"Ha! Messing with my runes is the last straw! Bring it on, world!" 😤🔥🔮 #TakingControl #NoMoreMessingAround
Why is your faith so high?
Between not wanting to play a game of cat and mouse with Elden beast and the absolute shit ton of damage my incantations can do against other bosses, I pumped it up pretty high. Of course I’m not against pulling some points off of it since I’m pretty sure I passed the caps anyways.
Do you cast more or melee more? Sorry for the delay wife just got home after 2 weeks so have some pent up "feelings" we are working through. 😂
I use those buffs, and really depending on the boss I’m fighting will determine if I go magic or a mix. I know I have to have at least 47 faith for one of my incantations, but the extra damage is definitely nice.
Ask alexander for help I heard he can use fire to a certain degree
Thanks i hope it works 🙏
As a Dark Souls veteran the most important lesson that Margit taught me was that Elden Ring is not Dark Souls. Your raw skill will transfer over, but your understanding will not. When you learn how to stop playing Elden Ring like it’s Dark Souls is when you’ll really start to enjoy the game.
I did, at first, like most players vets or not. Give it some time for you to get accustomed to the game. They're entirely new bosses, so it should be expected
Yeah go level up and get more familiar with the gameplay
Margit was designed specifically to violently break Dark Souls veterans. He has a quick ranged interrupt to stop your healing and buffing. He is incredibly acrobatic and agile in a fairly small arena and most punishing to DS vets, he delays a lot of his attacks. DS is a lot of learning boss movesets, Elden Ring is more about the flow. Bosses like Margit are designed for you to feel that almost instinctual flow of dodging hitting and healing. It is also possible you are underleveled for him. If you haven't yet go far south to an area called the Weeping Peninsula to level up and get more used to Elden Ring's unique tempo
Margit took me a solid 3 evenings to beat when I first started last year, by far my most boss deaths. He really does  teach you how to play the game
>am I just being a noob?  yes. gotta learn the delayed attacks. gotta explore first. up until you reach the capital is an open world game that wants you to explore it.
>Margit taught me was that Elden Ring is not Dark Souls  they have so many similarities, I'm indeed playing like Dark Souls XD  maybe I'll just explore the open world for a little bit and come back to him later
That's your best bet. Stormvale Castle is the END of the Limgrave area. You have the central area around the lake, the forest to the east, and the peninsula (that's really and island) to the south that all are technically meant to be done before. It's a big game. See the world, smell (and then kill) the flowers.
The perfect ending 🤌
Still meta and still cancer
Stars of ruin isn't meta anymore, btw
One wins and one loses
It was perfect PERFECT
Average moonveil hater
Nothing in this clip is meta
Google > Wiki > [Antspur Rapier Wiki Page](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Antspur+Rapier) \> Only has 1 drop location, and it's listed there.
Antspur Rapier is one-drop per journey.
It’s 1 time drop from the chick next to shaded castle.
Just bc its a one time drop per playthrough doesnt mean ya cant get mire by trading :)  r/patchesemporium
That's toooooo hard
Thank you simplified lol
Thank you lol looks like I’m speedruning for two of em I literally just beat new game 13 but I’m collecting all the weapons I missed
Much too hard
Well remember 20 million ppl have played the game and what a 100 or less are making rude comments? All games have toxic fans and they are also the loudest. Remember that veterans of the series prolly aren't watching many playthroughs of ER. It's prolly newer fans who have played it and think they are in some kind of git gud club. Don't read comments honestly especially on YouTube..full of trolls.
There's plenty of both. I've seen some ER streams with really supportive people in chat and some with some pretty negative people. Souls games definitely have a lot of "git gud" people which can seem pretty disheartening, but there are a lot of people who like watching others play and overcome the challenges the game offers. I also think YouTube can be pretty toxic, so I wouldn't put the blame on ER fans so much as frequent YouTube users who like ER.
My experience with fromsoftware communities is almost universally a negative one.
Fromsoftware's games communities have always been shit.
Elden ring fanbase is the second worst fanbase after bloodborne's. Dark souls trilogy are the most wholesome
YouTube has a lot of bad Elden Ring videos, once you put it out in the void you are inviting criticism.
The community is really nice, there's just a very small minority who are loud and toxic along with a bunch of new fans who probably want to put down others since this is the first one they beat and think that's what you do. I will say though sometimes when someone says "git gud" they aren't trying to be toxic. Sometimes that's just the best advice to give
Who gave BK Mascot meth?
Nah don't worry I already know this I just thought it was a funny joke because I remember before elden ring made fromsoft games much more popular the dark souls fanbase was actually one of the most pure, kind fanbases around. but since the popularity blew up now we have these toxic git gud players who's comments make it very obvious, they only use 1-2 hit insane strength builds that make every boss look pathetic. For example last comment I got was "wow you had to use 2 heals for the tree sentinel I swung my sword twice and he was dead." Like yeah because you obviously use some overpowered build sorry I don't like making the game as easy as possible 😂
Yeah I can definitely agree with that I was just surprised because like do some people really not understand the game isn't supposed to be easy, it's supposed to be a challenge. so me doing a run where I'm not some 1 hit strength build doesn't make me bad at the game, it means I want a challenge that will force me to get better at the game. that's just what I enjoy it's why I love fromsoft games I like the challenge I want it to be hard, I want to fail and I want to improve
I’m sorry you had bad experiences buddy
You already know what to level up.
your gudnes
More vigor then dex, I say this bc not only is 50 not enough with today's standards but also bc rivers' damage has better scaling on dex
WHAT A VIGOR ABOVE 14?! THIS MAN IS UNKILLABLE!
Int
I beat Elden ring 2 times, this is my first bleed build, I wanted to try something new and now I’m lost
I don’t do pvp if that’s what you mean by “not enough to todays standards” I mainly focused on pve because I like to just sit back and fight bosses and what not
I always prioritize health in video games
Why?
you ain t lost fam lol, even if you were with bleed you basically 2 shot everything in the game so wtvr
Then go for 50 and spend it maybe on fp or perhaps more dex yet again. Perhaps endurance, extra weight load never hurt anyone
I’m joking lol. Bleed generally works best with dex
Okay thanks
The lake of rot is lovely this time of year. Hop in!
Lovely scenery, but only one boss. There is the "Find all the basilisks" mini game though.
Come on in, the rot’s fine! 🥰
Weather's great all year-round, housing affordability is spectacular and the locals are one big happy family, what with the rotting flesh and hivemind to wanna chew your face off  Just don't feed the birds...
Can someone assist me with finding the funny?

On my second playthrough, I think my favorite boss this time around has been Mohg, Lord of Blood. My Night Comet spam wasn’t going to be effective against him since he jumps around a lot in phase 2, so I went at him from the get go with my Darkmoon Greatsword and got him down in two tries on my own, whereas before I needed a spirit ash summon to help out. That was really good.  I think my favorite boss from the first playthrough I did was Godfrey (the one with the second phase). His fight feels like a dance in the first phase. You can see exactly where your attack openings are, you just have to react and respond accordingly. Then you get to phase 2 and he suplexes you like a WWE Superstar dreams they could. The fight gets way more frantic in phase 2, especially if you don’t know how to dodge his wild swipes.
I don't think anyone beat it yet the game is just barely one year old
The most fun fight wasn’t a main boss for me. It was the assassin you fight to get the assassin spirit ashes.   But for bosses, the most fun I had was with Melania
Unpopular opinion but: Fire Giant. He’s massive and tanky so it lasts just the right amount of time and the arena is just the right size. The whole thing feels like an epic battle and he has a great cut scene.
Pre nerf Radahn
Rykard
I really like Morgott
Radabeast… the music… it all just slaps
Mohg, hands down  Pissed me the fk off the first dozen times but after becoming decent if not better at the combat, he genuinely gave me a fair challenge where fking up meant death, but exploiting weaknesses and seeing bits of his bar go yellow then reduce were euphoric.  I mean sure phase 2 was an absolute nuisance with his aerial attacks but fight him with music (in my case Straight To Hell by Ozzy Osborne, Shepherd Of Fire by The Avenged Sevenfold, and then finishing with Kickstart My Heart by Motley Crue) and it's easily one of the best Soulslike moments I've had in years
Finished my first playthrough a couple weeks ago!  I’d have to say overall the most FUN boss to fight was Mohg. His move set made sense to me and flows really well I think. I don’t feel he’s a very cheap boss, the fire can be annoying but after a couple tries you get used to maneuvering it and trying to kite him. Figuring out I could use the physick to nerf his life steal damage was really cool to.   I felt everytime I fought him I was getting better until I eventually beat him. Most of the time with more difficult and endgame bosses I reach a point where I start getting sloppy and have to take a break, so Mohg was difficult yet made me feel competent haha.  Godfrey is my honorable mention. More so because I thought he was a complete badass, so fighting him was fun. Though his first phase eventually became a formality to getting my shit pushed in during the second phase, over and over and over and over.. you get the point lol..
Alecto. She drops her daughters spirit ashes. Actually pretty depressing now that I think about it.
Have to agree here. Now he's literally like a helpless way to easy boss, that feels more like a late tutorial boss
That one was my second favorite.
Yeah original fight was extremely epic and you felt you really needed an army of summons to defeat him
#makeradahngreatagain.
No
Not that I disagree, but can you explain why you wouldn’t like that? Genuinely curious
They gave us a large pvp content just let them focus on what is more important(pve content)
Yeah, that’s a good point
DS3 player spotted...   Those backstabs.. beautiful..
Crispy ass pic, but go with whatever you like using the most.
Didn’t realize there was a deep-fried graphics setting
River of blood/Bleed build
Make a strength samurai which is what I’m using. Omen cleaver looks like an odachi with strength stats and use the sacrificial axe jar cannon like your from the sengoku period medioric blade for regular katana radans great bow and large club with crag blade aow for a konabo good luck samurai
Dragged that jpeg through the lake of rot lol
I wish😅, my phone just has a shit camera
Yes
The goat jar
I knew he was in the cave but it took me 3 journey's to trip over him in liurnia 😯... its really cool how many little interactions they snuck in with NPCs for the players to catch in consecutive journey's. Given that nothing changes run to run, finding the dialogs I missed prior was motivating.
He looks very happy to see you
Unpopular opinion... I wish everything respawned including bosses 🤣 (seriously, I think it would be neat if there was some option to respawn bosses, maybe just in each boss room individually after beating them just like the return to entrance warp appears, but I digress)  If I had to pick anything to not respawn it would be the sanguine assassins in mohgs palace cave. Every time I went back to buy bolts for my pulley crossbow they were right there to slow me down 😤... I murdered the merchant for his bell bearing after one respawned, unbeknownst to me, and snuck up and backstabbed me when I went to make my purchases!  That goddamn merchant and the sanguine were in cahoots the way I saw it! 👀
If I could choose two enemies to never respawn, it’d be the giant dogs and giant crows.
It would be great if the greyoll dragon respawn but it would very much make sense lol and also infinite run farm
I don’t want things to respawn automatically for the sake of the storyline but it would be really cool to have a talisman that could activate a one-time respawn of a boss at the stakes or something.
I like the night maiden/nox set with rogiers hat
Probably the altered night cavalry's set
Random mix
I don't know about this one but I love the outfit the knights on the black horses wear. You can get it by defeating 2 in one life in the winter area.
The helmet or the armor or both?
Both, altered
Try at r/BeyondTheFog you should get ppl to play with there
I'd be up for whatever but am on Playstation! Can always try r/beyondthefog - I've been going there too but.... I am too slow to catch anyone's pleas for help 😂 - I swear they get someone on the way for every psx request in 3 min or less
Cheers
Wow, how did I not know about this, excellent🫡
I love that the community is so diligent but it does make it hard haha the blue summon to assist with invaders is such a scam haha so many people already have it active I only get like one summon every other session haha, just discovered that subreddit from the comment above and I’m so stoked, never knew this existed
Also no cross play is responsible for me not being able to play with all my homies that do like the game, RIP 😂
This 💯 - really hoping the titles to come have cross play given ER's success but I don't hold my breathe. It honestly amazes me that by now cross play isn't a standard... I predicted 5 years ago that by now we'd all be playing everything cross platform, that it was just a matter of time, and I find myself still clinging to my belief in that despite the mounting evidence I am wrong!
Makes noooo sense to me, it must be difficult on the server side of things? I don’t know but man it’s in everyone’s best interest to have cross play!
I think the storm shield ash of war will intercept them. It works like parry but it only blocks the projectile.
Blasted them off the roof with the cannon
Sleep pot  Invisible body
Use mirrorshield. Has highest magic negation. You only need to deal with one of them. Hold block when hopping over the rooftops till you can charge them off the rooftops
Either cast Unseen Form or use the Assassin’s Gambit Ash of War and they’ll have a much harder time spotting you until you get close. Just be sure to use them before getting in sight, or it won’t work.
Good luck dealing those repeater railguns!
You can just shoot them off of the roof with a greatbow
I found this tip on this sub and it worked for me.  Since the cannot walk they can be flanked relatively easily.  Use the high stairs up to the portal to attack them from behind.
Oh btw, the Clinging Bone AoW doesn't work on them despite the description saying it works on all Humanoids
Carian shield or mirror shield
Great shield maxed out with any talisman that boosts guard
I just freehand chucked murder mist at them from a safe distance until they died 😅
2 words   Great. Shield.
Dodge
timed rolling
Headshots work pretty well.
The circle/B button
Line of sight
Try spelldrake talisman. Silver mirrorshield is also good. Those two and the black knife armor got me through this place without too much pain
Where is this?
The ballista just belts them straight off the roof. Don't  need to resist  them if they have a bone through the face on the other side of the building
Shield
As a bow aficionado, i enjoyed having a shoot out with them while using poison arrows and/or Rain of Arrows AoW.
JAR CANNON
Easiest way I found was too full sprint from the first ladder to the first spot u have to jump up, let the one by ladder shoot then jump and sprint to the next jump, you shouldn't have got hit at this point if u time it right then you jump up tank a hit and I use storm caller aow on a scythe to easily kill
What bow is that and can I get it?
Shoot them with a greatbow (knocks them off shooting positions) also bring a heavy shield
Do it quick.
Literally just used the jellyfish shield, it sponged the bulk of damage needed until I could reach and kill. Least, as far as Ordina's concerned
60 vigor and a sense of urgency to get to those lights.
Just go invisible
From from the site grace in town, head around to the back and all the way up the tall staircase. From the top, you can clearly see one of the archers and you can take him out first thing. That’s a good way to start
I found that using the poise crystal tear and the one that turns damage into heals is best, but it lasts for like ten/ fifteen seconds so I use it for the part with the two archers
Getting good - plus 5000 to awesomeness
I am overleveled (Level 200) and I reached Consecrated Snowfield a few days ago and these ladies were absolutely shredding me lol. The hit like trucks. Fromsoft seems to often give the enemies you would least expect high health pools and the highest damage 🤣
Prays the sun my friend. ☀️
You can shoot them out of position so that they cant see you approach with a canon or any bow.
I used gravity magic. There're 3 of these bitches, two on one roof and one one a small building in front and to the right from where you start. You get to that building on ground level, pull that bitch down and smack her. I was using Starscourge Greatsword, but I think Gravitas will work to. Then you get on the rooftop in front of the other two, and you are just at the maximum range of collapsing stars or gravity well. Pull her of the roof top and now you are dealing with each separately. If for some reason it doesn't work try concealing veil and assassin's gambit together.
Unironically don’t get hit. Play hide and seek with them and rush them. Or use ranged of your own.
Wait. Does the Carian Retaliation work on their arrows or is that just for projectile spells? Regardless, I never thought about the wind parry AoW.
>Invisible body  300 hours in and never even knew this existed. Here I am a souls veteran. No need to location drop it. I'll Google but thank you
Assassin's gambit makes this whole bit sooo much easier.    If you're maintaining invisibility, there's only one archer that is really necessary to kill and there's just a small chance of one other archer seeing you during that fight.   Otherwise you can entirely avoid the rest of the archers and the assassin's
the humanoids thing means the tarnished type enemies likes ensha, alberich, patches and such
2 words  Dodge.
This is for the hard to reach beacon that needs lit. The others don't really have archers guarding them. If you plan on farming them there are some outside the area that I saw someone farming with duel fingerprint shields and tanks armor idk about buffs
I dont think so. But try it and let me know haha I'm almost there on my current run.
There's an ash of war that grants the effect too, assassins gambit, you can buy it from bernhal in volcano manor.
Does black knife armor and assassin's approach work too
>patches  I chuckled a bit at this. I assume you hate Patches?
Does Godfrey count? He is tarnished, isn’t he?
1 word.   We're no strangers to love You know the rules and so do I (do I) A full commitment's what I'm thinking of You wouldn't get this from any other guy I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling Gotta make you understand Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you We've known each other for so long Your heart's been aching, but you're too shy to say it (say it) Inside, we both know what's been going on (going on) We know the game and we're gonna play it And if you ask me how I'm feeling Don't tell me you're too blind to see Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you We've known each other for so long Your heart's been aching, but you're too shy to say it (to say it) Inside, we both know what's been going on (going on) We know the game and we're gonna play it I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling Gotta make you understand Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
Haven't tried assassin's approach, but I can confirm that Black Knife Armour does not work.
i enjoy the man i was just naming people that it works on and those were the first ones that i happened to think of
386 words  Outstanding move
r/angryupvote
Very well played sir I can see you are a master of the art form that is poetry (can't believe you even thought of this lol)
A compliment? On Reddit? I am humbled, may your life be long, your death swift and your deeds legendary.
