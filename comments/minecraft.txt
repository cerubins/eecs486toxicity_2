Contact their support. They should know best how to update their hosting services.
It would likely either wipe the world or any new chunks would be wrong compared to the original terrain - my advice: make a backup just in case

You can artificially create this using update suppression
Wait, how rare is it to happen naturally and thanks for the explanation
Naturally, I've experienced this before with chunk loading errors, try reloading the chunks. I'm no expert though, and it's very uncommon naturally.
I did reload the chunk and it still there but it disappeared when a block is placed near it, I guess it's a visual glitch like the fake rain every once in a while

Best thing to do is to avoid the area before you summon the Warden. While I was mining near the Deep Dark biome I accidently summond the Warden. I thought he couldn't get me while I was stripmining. He killed me with his Sonic beam attack through the wall : (
Cover the shreiker in wool, if no shrieker is there, you can just walk through
Mine in a different direction
What I would personally do is just slowly mine towards it, and hope there is no shrieker nearby, if there is you do have a few triggers of it before a warden spawns. I would suggest trying to keep a fairly tight cap on your ceiling, make it 2 blocks tall max(prevents a warden from running after you). If you spawn a warden run back thru your tunnel like 30-50 blocks, just far enough to be very safe, while close enough that it's able to DeShawn on its own. And bring some wool too
Be carefil about the warden. The warden is way too op and unfair

Usually posts and comments explaining cheats and exploits are against ToS of Reddit. Correct me if I'm wrong. If not you might want find your answer on a different platform or website. And cheating in realms ? Of course you can do it on yours or your friend's server / world but doing it on other MC servers (without permission) is obviously not ok.

I'm trying to make a cobblestone tower. When I pour water next to the lava stream, instead of turning to cobblestone, it vanishes.
Step 1: Place lava. Wait for it to travel down to the level you desire.  Step 2: Scoop lava back into the bucket.  Step 3: Quickly place water.  TLDR: You don't. keep the lava stream. It turns to cobble. But you can keep the original bucket and reuse it infinitely.
I tried that. The lava just falls down to the bottom at water speeds.
I'm fine with losing the lava. But no matter what I do, only the top of the lava stream will turn to cobblestone.

As I **remember**, bad omen can not be removed by drinking milk
You can remove bad omen with milk. If you already started the raid, then it's too late.
It always has in the past this time the little icon goes away but you were still charged with it
it can be removed with milk, actually! i suspect this may be an issue with accidentally having started the raid before removing the effect

Copper ore block
It’s a raw copper block, you find them in those really big copper veins.
Raw copper block when mined it gives more than normal copper
You just found a huge vein of copper, keep mining the granite, which is the pinkish reddish block, and you should find a good load of copper. The block you're asking about is a raw copper block, just place it into your crafting and you'll get 9 raw copper back to smelt
people saying copper ore are confusing ive never seen it like that before
You have a pickaxe
its copper ore
Thus is referred to as "bean." No more. No less. Just bean
"WHY ARE THERE BEANS EVERYWHERE" - Camman18
Strawberry block
Just like you occasionally find a block of raw iron, this looks like a block of raw copper. Rather than copper ore in another stone.
is in granite? ive never seen it before in that reddish color before
It appears rarely in granite at low Y levels
Its a raw copper ore block. They spawn in big veins which can be found in granite deep underground. You can also find big veins of iron with raw iron ore blocks in tuff.
ive never seen it in the reddish color before
It’s apart of a vein which I think only can be found in granite

I've played Minecraft since the early alpha days, and literally just had my first jawdrop moment at the generation making beautiful views.  Literally just spawned in, climbed a mountain and was stunned, it's amazing. (The screenshot is from a drifferent angle).  The seed is 2932153704265665548 if anyone is curious.  There's two villages really close to spawn (one Plains and one Snowy), along with ruined portals and, as you can see beautiful ice-spikes.  This may just be me being old and marveling at nothing, but it was so awesome.
I do the same thing when i see a beautiful girl for the first time

they'll have to download the mod as well. the only thing i can think of is if the mod has a different name, or using a datapack instead
If the mod in question is adding a mob then the game would be prompting them to install the mod before being allowed into the server.

Relatively common...
Actually?
Yes. There's not too many enchantments a fishing rod can have (relative to other gear) and it's pretty common getting an enchanted one in general. I had like three better rods than that before I fished up a name tag I needed.

well, it depends on what do you want to focus on: do you want a chill world or do you want to finish the game and thats it? For a chill world id recommend somewhere like mountains or either jungle to build a nice house with the view, but also keep in mind that you will need a place to get resources. In my chill world i have a base in a little island inside a lake and it’s really cool since i build a terrace and a little balcony, would recommend. hope I could help, enjoy your world!
Thank you for the tip! I’ll keep that in mind :)

Nope you are all maxed out on this one... although i personally won't use thorns since it chews the durability of it but it doesn't have any huge impacts on/off so I'm ok anyhow
got mending on all my armor and I got an Enderman farm so not too worried about durability
Looks like you are all set then. happy mining!

java edition player can use litematica, a blueprint mod for building. basically makes a hologram of the build that you follow, if that would interest you, you could work at any pace you'd like. remember that youtube has playback speed control, so maybe putting your video on .75× or 1.25× could help make them more accessible. subtitles help with fast speaking content creators.
YouTube can be played up to 2x speed and down to 0.25 speed. You can try that.
Thata not you, it just takes a bit to find a good youtuber you like.   You can also watch the videos without sound and just listen to music.
You can speed up or slow down videos

If your world is massive you might want to. Reason being anything new with the update will only spawn in newly loaded chunks so if you gotta travel really far for new generation it might be better to start a fresh world.
When does it come out? Does it not just update with the new stuff? I just got into a wicked seed and I'll be a little bummed to scrap it..
Thank you. I'll start my search for a new seed once it comes out, in the meantime I may play around in snapshot or in creative testing out new builds.
No. Only newly loaded chunks will have the new generation.
Well, I do know that new stuff usually doesn't spawn in chunks you've explored (I learned this the hard way when the update for the swamps came out) and I had to go 5500+ chunks to find a new swamp biome layout and get mangrove trees. I'm not sure if it will spawn in torch flowers or sniffers though since they aren't a biome. However I can assume cherry blossom biomes won't spawn in chunks you've already explored.  Edit to add: I think it comes out in June or July. I've been a bit bad on keeping up with it.

That error message means that whatever coordinates you’re trying to access are outside of memory, aka they’re not loaded in.   I’m assuming that you’re trying to use coordinates next to you, so it would be silly for them to be unloaded. I’d double check to make sure your coordinate values are correct.
I actually just figured it out when you sent this omg😭 thank you. I didn't think I was that far out but apparently I was
I’m not sure if bedrock users can do this (at least on windows), but in Java if you’re typing a command you can press “tab” when it’s expecting coordinates and it’ll auto fill the values with where you currently are.   Here’s my super nifty workflow with it:  1. go to position 1 2. type “/fill *tab tab tab*” 3. hit enter 4. go to position 2  5. open chat and press the up arrow to access the previous message 6. *tab tab tab*  7. fill in whatever values I’m using the fill command for  8. ??? 9. Profit

Onboard graphics definitely aren’t the worst these days, but playing at 1440p and expecting consistently above 60 while recording is a stretch. For recording video games you’re not going to need anything higher than 1080p anyways, so I’d suggest lowering resolution.
I definitely wouldn't call an 8 year old, dual-core Core i7 with integrated graphics "mid-end", even CPUs that are considered "budget" (Core i3's and Ryzen 3's) from 3 - 4 years ago are way faster.  You can try using the Fabulously Optimized modpack (which is far better than OptiFine or Lunar), but that's pretty much all you can do. The CPU matters more in Java Edition than the graphics card/GPU, but given your CPU only has 2 cores and you're playing in 1440p (and also recording it), it's pretty much expected to see lower fps.

One block in the nether is 8 blocks in the overworld. To properly link up portals take the coordinates of the portal in the overworld and devide them by 8. That is where you need to build a portal in the nether to properly link them up. I'm pretty sure there are tutorials on YouTube that can explain it better than me though.

It's up to you with what you want to do with the duped items if it's a single-player world. You can keep them or throw them into the void. As for why that happend I have no clue.
