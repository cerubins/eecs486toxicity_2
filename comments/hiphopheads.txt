I personally felt this was a return to form for them, I didn‚Äôt care for 2 or 3 that much.  Also in case anyone missed it, with how much love Not So Bad is getting (rightfully) make sure to check out Not So Bad off the latest French Montana Coke boys album. Its just as good in my opinion.
Horrifically dull
On one listen, it's ok. No tracks reach the high tracks on their previous album. But I wouldn't say any of the songs are outright bad. A bit boring maybe. I also feel like Jxmmi outshined Swae.   They really messed up not making Bend Ya Knees a single. I can see that blowing up on TikTok. Obviously they still can release it, but probably could've had more hype going into the album release if they release Bend Ya Knees first  Also I think that track Finger Food would've been a good addition to the tracklist.   Anyway, favorite tracks are Flaunt It, Bend Ya Knees, and Sexy.  Sremmlife 2 is still their best work imo
Track with Thugger goes hard.
Anyone else really like ‚Äúsomething i‚Äôm not‚Äù? Like really fucking like it? It‚Äôs chill af and all around a banger imo, its probably a bit too chill to blow up mainstream but I fuckin love it.
Overall though unfortunately a bit mid. Idk it‚Äôs just missing the hype from previous bangers like swang, no flex zone, look alive, black beatles, etc.   It is missing the hype aspect completely, the album sounds way too chill, and if you make a chill album at the very least you need great memorable hooks (unforgettable for example has a great hook), but I felt the hooks were lacking as well.  Still some solid songs though, I feel like ‚Äúactivate‚Äù could‚Äôve gotten BIG if promotion for the album was better. Future verse wasn‚Äôt the greatest though.  ‚ÄúNots so bad‚Äù was fucking butchered beyond belief as well, and the vocals from swae here were great so idk what happened with production.
Lmaoooo I‚Äôm skimming through now and not so bad is hilarious to me. Who‚Äôs idea was that lol  That was a really bad ending it sounds like a corny Mario Judah imitation.  I listened on iPhone speakers but this album felt really empty sonically the beats were too basic but this had better songs on average than the last album and had much less filler  I like it esp royal flush tanisha flaunt it ymca and torpedo
It's the definition of mid.
7.5/10. Pretty good. Production, performers, and writers came with it.
Swae fucked up bad by not releasing a studio version of leans gone cold, other than that idk album is below average. I like origami a bit and royal flush but that‚Äôs about it. Swae Lee just can‚Äôt seem to produce the wavey flows he used to idk why, surely he knows that‚Äôs his greatest strength ? I don‚Äôt even wanna talk about Jimmy he‚Äôs tolerable at best when swae is going off but when swae is off it, Jimmy is just 20x more annoying to hear. Atleast Kaytrana released a banger w Amine lol
üöÆ üóëÔ∏è
it‚Äôs fine there‚Äôs some songs I‚Äôm gonna put in my playlist and there‚Äôs some songs, I‚Äôm never gonna listen to again, but I think we all knew that going into it.
it might be their best work
Just listened to Not So Cold by french! Thank you for putting me on
I have to agree. Got about 5 tracks in and had to turn it off. Eventually returned to it to realize there still weren‚Äôt any surprises. Swae is a great feature artist and that‚Äôs where he stands with me
Bruh I don't know if listening through iphone speakers is very reliable in telling you how it sounds üòÇ
Was looking forward to that track but Swae not recording a studio version‚Ä¶ I mean come on.
I agree lol which is why I mentioned it. Idk mayne I‚Äôm not a science bitch

This is so much worse than Nu Religion what happened. Literally no slaps
Not melodic at all or nice sounding

Hello! Please do not use agephobic phrases or words such as old. Hurtful language about mental image can have significant negative impacts on an oldheads mental health and self-esteem. It may also be triggering. When someone is subjected to derogatory comments about their oldassness, they may begin to feel ashamed or embarrassed about their body, leading to feelings of low self-worth and poor body image. This can result in harmful behaviors such as disordered eating or excessive listening to purple haze to change their body in an attempt to conform to societal beauty standards. Moreover, hurtful language about body image can also contribute to the development of anxiety and depression, leading to long-term consequences on an individual's mental health. Therefore, it is crucial to promote oldheadness and refrain from making negative comments about someone's age. Even if this was not your intention, you never know who might see your comment.

This is a house album btw, a follow up to the one he dropped last year that was great
First house tape got me super into the genre. Can‚Äôt wait to hear this later.
no wayyyyyy
Amazing looks
Whatever that sample is on the first track sounds super familiar and I can‚Äôt figure out what the duck it‚Äôs from
knxwledge gets talked down upon but he for the culture, straightup
HOUSE 2?????
I'm so happy he released a followup, that first one was great.

When sparks fly is so fire
Aye! (Free the homies) is such a vibe.   Track is still in my rotation.  Solid album, made even better when cruising through LA
One of my favorite albums from last year not a single skip on it for me. I feel like it‚Äôs way too slept on no one mentions it when talking about 2022 drops
the beach was such a dope intro track
Crazy that nobody mentioned ROSE STREET yet to me. Top 10 most played songs for me last year.   ONLY BRINGING FLOWERS TO THE HOMIES GRAAAAVE
I listened to this a lot on release then it sort of faded for a bit, but I remember relistening again late last year and being surprised at how well it aged to me. This has some of the best production of any Vince project and I really enjoy how themes such as romance and trust are much more prominent here than on previous projects. I‚Äôve enjoyed pretty much everything he‚Äôs released since Hell Can Wait, but it really feels like his best work is yet to come. Great album and looking forward to what‚Äôs next.
Player Ways is a personal favorite. Anyone else?
People had differing views on this album, but it was personally my AOTY last year. Could not get enough. Zero skips, all bangers. I‚Äôm not sure if it tops ‚ÄúVince Staples‚Äù cause I just felt that was all killer no filler. However, having loved that album, I was elated to get a bunch more tracks with a similar vibe.  Too many favourites to count, but When Sparks Fly will go down as one of my favourite hip hop songs of all time. Player Ways and DJ Quik are replayed often. In terms of weakest tracks, maybe Lemonade cause it feels like it doesn‚Äôt fit the rest of the vibe, but I wouldn‚Äôt call it bad.  I wish everyone felt the way I felt about this album, but to each their own.  EDIT: [Adding my credentials](https://imgur.com/4yWDEtM)
Papercuts. Beautiful song.
SLIDE is the most underrated song on the album just wish it was longer.
AND TELL THE POLICE I DON'T WHAT HAPPENED!!!
I actually threw this on yesterday on my late night drive home. Such a chilled album. AYE! (FREE THE HOMIES), MAGIC, DJ QUIK & WHEN SPARKS FLY get me hooked for the whole album.   Everyone usually has a playlist or album for any occasion and this record will definitely stay as a late night listen for myself.   I like the direction Staples has taken recently on this album and his self titled release the year before, he's one of a handful of artists I look forward to seeing release.
My favorite album from last year. The intro and outro tell such a story. The Blues is such a beautiful fucking song man
I think this is Vince‚Äôs best project hands down, with the most replay ability for me, but that‚Äôs best amongst a whole lot of quality albums.
ngl this is my AOTY for 2022 lol
This has some of his best hooks and a few of his best tracks period (When sparks fly) but overall this is definitely not his best album. Probably top 3 but i would take self titled and summertime 06 over it
East Point Prayer is in my top 20 songs of last year (2022)
Weird take here: I don‚Äôt think Vince is capable of making a bad track (at least at this point in his career). Individually, all these tracks are solid as fuck. But as a collective‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not sure if it stuck. I think what it is is that it‚Äôs too consistent. It‚Äôs clear to me that he comes up with a certain mood or aesthetic when crafting the album, and then kind of stays there. It‚Äôs on cruise control. And while it‚Äôs on purpose, it‚Äôs just not my thing.   I‚Äôm still loving his series of short albums. FM and self-titled showcased the most interesting artistic choices in his career. But I cannot say that RPBMH is a bad album at all. It just doesn‚Äôt hit for me like that
It has ben a year already????
When sparks fly and player ways are my shittttt
He said in rap radar he released the album when the budget ran out. Also crazy he said Magic and When Sparks Fly were recorded on the same day!
great record. One of my favorites from last year
Probably listened to East Point Prayer like a thousand times last year
This album is such a vibe. It's not in your face, but there's just something about it. It's got its own personality about it. It's just so cool.
Finished r/75hard to this
I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs ever been an instance of one track overshadowing the rest of the record as much as WHEN SPARKS FLY did with this. Obviously the whole record is great, but that is one of the best rap songs of the past like, ten years.  DJ QUIK, LEMONADE, and PAPERCUTS are definitely my other favourites
can't believe this one is already a year old. this and more black superheroes never left regular rotation for me. great albums
PAPERCUTS is so underrated
Lot of songs I still go back to regularly, been listening to Vince for a while and Idk yet if this is my favorite project of his but it's for sure up there for me. Very cohesive and catchy album that feels like a step forward while also not feeing like a reach at all which I really appreciate and respect. Favorite songs are (in order of tracklist appearance) Aye, Magic, When Sparks Fly (one of the best songs he's ever made,) Papercuts, Lemonade, Player Ways (also one of the best songs he's ever wrote to me) and Rose Street. He did an interview recently where he touched on the logistics of making this album and his self titled and it was really interesting to hear how these albums were shaped, specifically how budgetary constraints impacted the making of these albums and how he moved resources around to get them finished.
Bang that!
Man this album just dropped at the perfect time for me. I saw Vince live on Tyler‚Äôs tour, so I was listening to a lot of his music to get a refresher. I wasn‚Äôt ever a huge Vince fan, had only listened to FM! when it came out and listened to self titled like once on the way to work one day, but I liked everything I‚Äôd heard. When I saw him live, Magic had just dropped four days earlier, so that song was still fresh on my mind and I really liked it. So when he announced this album, I was actually pretty excited. At the time, I worked about 40 minutes away from home, and so I would just throw this album on as soon as I left home and by the time I got to work it was already on the last song. And when I drove home, I would do the exact same thing. This was also a cubicle job where I did a lot of mind-numbing data entry and file retrieval, so I listened to a lot more new music and podcasts during that time. And if I had no podcasts that day? Just throw on the Vince album. Need something to listen to on the way to work? Throw on the Vince album. On the way home? Vince album. Like 2 or 3 times a day, 5 days a week, for like a month until I left that job.  This album just has everything I want man, I don‚Äôt know. Despite so many incredible albums coming out last year, I still have to say that this was somehow my album of the year. None of the songs are too long, they get in, do their thing, and get out. They‚Äôre catchy and easy to listen to, but if you really listen to what he‚Äôs saying he‚Äôs actually rapping his ass off. Glad I blindly bought the autographed CD before it came out (which unfortunately arrived with a crack in the case), and the vinyl was the easiest purchase of my life. The album definitely turned me from a casual Vince fan to someone who is eagerly waiting for more music from him.
I love player ways, I wish I can relate but I get no bitches
Slide hhas become one of my favorite beats ever. So simple but that's what makes it hit harder
Surprised nobody is talking about Bang That - best track on the album for me
Album is competing for AOTY of yesteryear with Denzel's MMESYF
Still is one of the BEST albums of the decade
Some good tracks but one of his worst albums
‚ÄúBaby how you got that lil bitch getting you man‚Äù?
Lemonade is a great drink, and it still is. This album v good, even the weaker songs slap. I dig When Sparks Fly and even Aye!(Free The Homies) and Magic just keep getting better. Damn 2022 was a great year for music.
One of my favourite albums ever
Crazy that it‚Äôs only been 1 year because it feels like such a classic, papercuts and when sparks fly are a vibe
Love this album. Vince Staples is a treasure and continues to put out great albums. So many great songs on this one. AYE! (Free the homies) and when sparks fly are my favs
I love this album. I have been down af lately. This album perfectly fits for how I feel. Like I‚Äôm not out yet but I‚Äôm getting there. It‚Äôs not hype it‚Äôs dark and melancholy to me at least in a lot of the beats. But songs like magic and lemonade are upbeat enough to make remind me we gettin through. Bars like ‚Äúw would you come post my bail? It‚Äôs 100 thousand. I know you say you wish me well‚Ä¶ But I really doubt it.‚Äù Hit so deep for me. I didn‚Äôt listen to this till the beginning of this year but it made Vince my most streamed artist over March. 10/10.
MAGIC, WHEN SPARKS FLY, PAPERCUTS, MAMA'S BOY, and ROSE STREET have gotten a lot of plays from me.  Definitely my favorite project from Vince since Summertime '06. If there was anything I had to complain about, it would just be the laid back delivery on a lot of the tracks compared to his previous work. But that's just nitpicking tbh - it works well here.
When sparks fly beat y‚Äôall enough said
Kind of the same opinion as a lot of people here I think. Bumped this album heavy for 2-3 months after it came out but kinda fell off of it after. Partially I do think I overplayed it for myself. Fantastic album tho, always good on a revisit.
This is such a good fucking album.  Papercuts, slide, and player ways slap so fucking hard. And obviously the more popular ones magic, rose street, and lemonade are amazing.  I'd say this was a very close 2nd to denzels album mmesyf for my aoty last year.
This is probably my favorite album from him
Aye! goes so hard
Such a good album
Time will do this masterpiece justifce. There‚Äôs not a single bad track in it.
Production is mid but the bars are decent. I still miss the days of Summertime 06 and Big Fish Theory.
Slept on this album hard last year. Didn‚Äôt find it until December, but it easily became top 3 of the year for me.
Vince doesn't miss man. Since Summertime 06, he hasn't put out a bad project and each of the last have been even better IMO.
my fave project of his
The Blues is the most underrated track on here. This is my fav Vince album, stays in rotation. One before this was real good too
I was just bumpin it yesterday, papercuts lemonade and rose street are so replayable
Flawless lp in my book. Vince really went back to back in a year.  East Point Prayer still gets daily spins üî•üî•üî•
Def woulda been my AOTY if not for Luv 4 Rent and Forever Story. So good from front to back. Papercuts, Magic, and free the homies are still every day plays for me
Last year I was making a playlist and stumbled on a really cool transition from MAGIC into RISE! by Tyler the Creator. MAGIC ends with DJ Drama saying some motivational shit which carrie‚Äôs straight into RISE! It‚Äôs awesome
RPBMH & Vince Staples are both amazing albums. They show a real nuanced Vince, knowing where he's from while not letting it get in the way of who he is today. Creatively, he his on top of his game atm. Excited to see the next creative step in his discography.
This album was incredible.  Definitely super underrated.  Felt like the record Vince has been trying to make and I love it
I keep it funky with the bitches
Mama‚Äôs Boy
Top 3 last year. Underrated and his second best. Have it as a solid 9/10
The beat is like if James Blake and Hell On Earth era Havoc did a beat together
I still listen to Aye! quite a lot :) great track!!
‚ÄúShoot a n!gga mama if she out while we sliding‚Äù üò≠ on the most upbeat bounciest beat ever
It‚Äôs good but the lyrics are kinda sad/melancholy
This so much bro!  I‚Äôm back in the Chi now, and not to ever diminish Mr Staples greatness, his music def hits different in LA county lol.  Not that it‚Äôs worse in Chicago, but def different
I recall when BOTH of the last two Vince albums dropped, a lot of people in this sub seemed to write them off immediately (and partly due to Kenny Beats exec production, which is ridiculous because on top of his existing catalogue he released one of the best instrumental hip hop albums of the decade last year)
same. it held my top spot until The Forever Story dropped, and even then it was a very close second
Conversely the blues is an awesome closer
aw man everybody killa
I don't sing no love songs.
Rose street is the track I come back to the most, I‚Äôm 110% with you that shit is so cold and so catchy, perfect encapsulation of Vince
I love The ROSE STREET but I liked it more in the context of the album after the entire project dropped. It didn‚Äôt stand out as a single like Magic did.
One of my favorite Vince choruses, so simple but so hard hitting
Same here. Great album to revisit.
Not my favorite but definitely top 3.
She dont want nothin but  A little company  Until the sun is up  And thats enough for me  10/10
I play that song back all the time. It‚Äôs too smooth and too player to not get a spin from me
Yes I always play this song. Man it‚Äôs so good.
my favorite for sure. This album has wonderful playback even a year later.
absolutely, player ways felt like it could have been a mainstream crossover to me
I get your lemonade take but damn if that isn‚Äôt my most played on the album, hook is crack
Man I absolutely feel this way about this album. Not a single skip for me and was also a personal favorite of mine last year. I wish it got a little more love
See me round the city, SAY WHAT‚ÄôS UP!!
This and Mama's Boy for me. Slide now carries a haunting tone to it because of personal reasons
Hell yeah. Not even 3 minutes.
You were so close, man
That's kinda how I feel. I love Vince but I don't know he can really hit a bigger stride. I feel like he's always just gonna be making very specific albums his whole career. I'd love if he took some time off and made something experimental (Big Fish is experimental production wise but rapping wise Vince sounded exactly the same)  Might be an unpopular opinion though, I just love when artist step outside the box
Liquor gunshot blood shot corneas
Funny you mention that! Guess which Mobb Deep song is sampled on WHEN SPARKS FLY‚Ä¶   [It‚Äôs this one] (https://youtu.be/PH5gDJrDdYE)
That's actually a super good way of describing it
The opening f'in line üòÇ
I feel like Vince mastered the, ‚ÄúHey Yah!‚Äù vibe. His tracks slap, they make you wanna dance, bop your head, or just vibe-out, but when you really start to focus on the lyrics they‚Äôre not happy at all and they‚Äôre very introspective of a life lived around chaos.
Yeah I loved his previous project as well
Yeah, his self-titled went super under the radar, I actually enjoyed it more than CMIYGL on repeat listens of each album.
Only bringing flowers to the homie‚Äôs grave
Can‚Äôt argue that, but I feel like all of the hooks on this album are fire. Arguably the best so I feel you.
Also I fuckin love the aluminum bat "ping" sound in the beat, so clever
Hell yeah homie. There are dozens of us.
Lol. Just noticed. I'm keeping it.
Would love another big fish theory. I think he needs another album like that and prima donna with ‚Äúunconventional‚Äù beats to wrap over
Precisely. Great way to put it
Never caught that but I hear it now

Kind of crazy Tyler sold 70k of a deluxe album almost a year after the original release. Dedicated fan base for real!
Big W for Larry. Numbers üçä
#Last Week Update  [BB200](https://www.billboard.com/charts/billboard-200/) is out for last week:   - **Danny Brown & JPEGMAFIA debuted #84:** Cornballs was #105, Old was #18 (sold 15K), Atrocity was #77, and uknow was #134 - **Myke Towers debuted at #173:** Easy Money Baby was #55 and Lyke Mike was #36 (sold 16K)  ---  #This Week  Larry June's *Spaceships on the Blade* (2021) sold 17K  Tyler the Creator's *CALL ME IF YOU GET LOST* sold 170K (55K pure) in its first week and 50K vinyls when its vinyl's dropped in April 2022.  Lil Wayne & Rich the Kid's *Trust Fund Babies* (2021) sold 15K and *Funeral* (2020) sold 139K (38K pure)  Chl√∂e, Juicy J, DJ Drama, A$AP ANT, Luh Tyler, Autumn! , ShooterGang Kony, Cash Kidd, CEO Trayle, B.o.B, tobi lou, Royce da 5'9" etc. sold less than 14,567  ---  #Next Week  Daniel Caesar, NF, and Rae Sremmurd will make the 50. Rae Sremmurd will sell like 25-35K and everyone will act really shocked about it
Good job Larry üçä
The Larry June and Alc project wasn't exactly my vibe but I *love* seeing them place like this. Clearly a lot of people are loving it and they both deserve to be talked about more.
The Great Escape üçäüçä
70k for a deluxe is fucking wild. Tyler isnt just a mainstream rap artist, hes a mainstream artist period. Definitely deserved too.
Tyler doing more than the majority of rappers with a deluxe 2 years later is wild. Respect. DJ Khaled in shambles.
I forgot to check out Wayne‚Äôs tape I feel so bad
Wooow Gorillaz with the same amount of streams as Ice Spice, but then you look at the actual sales and they beat everybody on the list. That's those late Gen X/Millenial physical sales for you
tyler only sold 70k. bro fell off, its joever /j
Numbers. Good Job Larry üçä
Anyone know what Chloe sold? My girl been playing it and I'm curious.
i fucking love the gorillaz though damn
 Wait, 70k is not low?
Damn davido really fell off
I don't know the majority of these people. I am so out of touch.
almost 2 years actually
It‚Äôs basically an EP of really nice tracks‚Ä¶plus the original has a lot replay value.
I'm one of those.  I wanted to get the CD of the original release for a while but did not.  Saw that the deluxe CD had everything and was only slightly more than the original CD on amazon (including shipping) so it was an immediate buy.
Better than the original imo so makes sense
His concert in Van popped up in my memories today for it smh
Guess I'm one of those fans! Never had the option to pick up the original release so figured, why not get the deluxe version.
I back those Rae Sremmurd numbers. Was checking their IGs and engagement seems really low for them
I mean that's good for Peggy and Danny tbh, new peak for the former and a slight push back up for the latter. Cracking the top 100 with an album that fuckin weird is no lean feat
That‚Äôs basically Rae Sremmurd‚Äôs numbers area though Sremm 2 sold 30k and 3 sold 57k so you can expect it around that area considering they lost their hype and its been 5 years
Damn I'm surprised Chl√∂e isn't doing more, I feel like her label's been pushing her for a while.
IFYKYK
Not to be a hater, cuz I can see why people like Larry June. But does anyone feel like his shit is mad monotone, and his lyrics aren‚Äôt interesting enough to get over it?
It's that mysterious shit and you never hear it
*Another ~~one~~ two*
It was just a greatest hits compilation
Wild too cuz it‚Äôs mid.
I mean, Ice Spice is pretty viral rn cuz boy's a liar.     Gorillaz gives a lot more merchan-wise, thats why they destroy in physical sales.
Sock it to me, god damn!
Was wondering the same
Someon said 12k
Extremely high for a deluxe
Don‚Äôt feel bad. The majority of these people aren‚Äôt really relevant anyways.
Shit, you‚Äôre right! Time flies. Even more impressive.
I don't disagree with you but at the same time it's wild to me how many people shared my experience of skipping CMIYGL or not really being able to get into it on initial release and falling in love with the deluxe album.  dogtooth, heaven to me, and sorry not sorry are my favorites from the album. but some of the older tracks like juggernaut and corso and others grew on me enough that I was playing the whole album on repeat.
That‚Äôs wild
All the singles tanked from what I remember
Haven't seen any marketing for it, coming off an album that wasn't received well, and no standout hit on the record. Makes sense to me. I actually quite like the album though, so it's a shame.
might be a controversial take, but Swae Lee shines bright on features, not his own albums since the febut. no idea what the fuck SJ is doing either.
It‚Äôs a shame they never maintained the limelight after 2017/2018.
Are there any really stand out tracks from the album? I haven‚Äôt listened to it yet, but none of the singles really grabbed me previously.
Yeah that‚Äôs my feeling in dude. Last album sounded like a more bored Dom Kennedy.
His delivery was why I can't connect with his work, but it's the same reason I don't connect with Earl and I recognize they're both hella talented in spite of that.  Not all art is made for us and that's alright, I guess is my take on that haha
I was bored as hell listening. It was fun at first. Now I‚Äôm tired of hearing him rapping about smoothies and the stock market
The Power of The Alchemist.
I really wasn‚Äôt a big fan of The Great Escape either. I‚Äôve been a big fan for a couple years, and I was expecting more ‚Äúdrive down 101 type vibes‚Äù but it is a little TOO slow for that :/ I definitely recommend his Cruise USA tale with Cardo though. 10/10 album
He sounds like Curren$y but not at all interesting imo
CALL ME EXPARAGUS
I was not consulted and it shows
Merch bundles haven‚Äôt counted toward album sales since like 2020?
Body do a banger couldnt listen to the rest though ngl

both tracks are much better than this first single
The return of Hall & Nash. Fire!
this duo really can't be fucked with
Who produced Brucifix? That beat is crazy
Extremely hard video lol. Griselda is legendary
How these dudes hold up their heads and hands when they're wearing those chains and bracelets/watches, yeesh.  Great pair of tracks, always love when they drop videos, too.
Gonna need Brucifix on streaming soon
This shit so hard   Conway flow on that first shit was ridiculous
Shit is heat. Griselda coming for 2023.
Agree, that Super Bowl joint weren‚Äôt it. I‚Äôm glad he put these two out now!  I hope LALO makes the Won‚Äôt He Do It album, he was supposed to drop that as a single in February but didn‚Äôt smh.
Genius says Daringer
Really dig this, it‚Äôs one of my favorite Fahim releases of the year   All the songs with Mach are great, as well as the song with Jay Nice, as well as New Devils, Tha Fiendz, Party On A Boat, & Tha Forwarding Of Payment
I'd say probably is the best Fahim release along with Shot clock king 4. Dump legends 2 and Iron Bull are good as well but SCK4 and this new one are on another level.   This guy released 7 projects already and it's only april damn, he's hardest working man in rap rn
My ranking off the top of my head is something like:   1. Notorious Dump Legends 2  2. Dump Gawd Reloaded   3. Berserko  4. Chess Moves  5. Iron Bull   6. Dark Shogun Assassin  I haven‚Äôt listened to Shot Clock King 4 enough to rank it but it‚Äôs good
man i thought i was crazy i thought this was your all time fahim ranking  where would you put bloodspiller though if it had come out this year i think it could be my favorite project he‚Äôs done in the past two years
Buck 65 now has to use Bandcamp? Wow.

amazing album. can't wait to hear what he and Kenny Segal have cooking for Maps.
I was lucky enough to have a brief conversation with him when he played Toronto last year. Such a down to earth guy. One of the most talented poets in the game right now
Probably his most ambitious work, both conceptually and musically. All the features are so clocked in and Preservations beats really got the African atmosphere going on. And then all the themes of colonization are explored so grotesquely and can be tied to more modern issues. Not my favorite of his but it‚Äôs definitely got a claim to his best
My 2022 AOTY. There were a few serious competitors for me between Denzel's and JID's projects, but I love me some complicated lyricism. It also helps that the production on this is unearthly good, Preservation did his thing and then some.  The quality of woods' writing has only gone up for me over the course of his discography, and this project was bonkers. Dense dissections of neocolonialism, its effect on identity, and hopping through millennia in the span of a couplet make this one a standout in what was already a phenomenal year in hip-hop.  The features too: Boldy James, Quelle Chris, and El-P were particular highlights for me. The spirit of collaboration and joy of creating a sick ass product really shines through on the group cuts.  I could go on and on about how much I love this album, but I already did that in the write-ups for 2022 albums. To anyone who sees this thread and hasn't listened, do yourself a favor and check this album out. You won't be disappointed. Looking forward to seeing what woods has been cooking with Kenny Segal when Maps drops next month!  Edit: typed too fast and misspelled a couple things
Absolutely excellent album.   It doesn‚Äôt top ‚ÄúHiding Places‚Äù for me, but I could definitely see why someone would think that this is his best work. The transition from ‚ÄúWharves‚Äù to ‚ÄúSauvage‚Äù is fucking nasty and was one of my favorite musical moments from last year as a whole.   On another note, it really disappoints me that Billy doesn‚Äôt garner the amount of attention and respect which he so rightfully deserves in the Hip-Hop community. You could probably take any single bar from ‚ÄúSauvage‚Äù and get more introspection and emotion from it than on many modern rapper‚Äôs entire albums.   If you enjoy Billy‚Äôs work and haven‚Äôt heard ‚ÄúKa‚Äù, I would definitely check him out. They occupy relatively similar lanes in the community with their poetic, esoteric lyrical qualities, as well as the way in which they‚Äôre often able to address the same topics in a variety of different forms and contexts. I‚Äôd recommend ‚ÄúThe Night‚Äôs Gambit‚Äù, ‚ÄúHonor Killed the Samurai‚Äù, and ‚ÄúThe Hermit and the Recluse‚Äù, all absolutely fantastic albums
That Despot verse is God tier. My personal pick for verse of the year last year. The album as a whole was only just behind Cheat Codes for me. Just an amazing listening experience.
This album is honestly special to me as an Ethiopian.  Listening to Asylum for the first time is one of the most incredible experiences I've ever had listening to a song. One of my favorite rappers of all time sampling an Ethiopian jazz song that I've heard so many times to paint an incredible picture of a dictator that my dad told me all about... I can't even describe it to you guys how taken aback I was.  Haarlem is another song that samples Ethiopian Jazz. I swear to God... people are sleeping on this genre. Not only is it amazing on it's own, it's also a great source to sample beats from. DJ Preservation jumped a lot of fucking places on my favorite producers list after I heard this album.  And what can I say about woods' songwriting that hasn't already been said? The man has a gift. In another universe, he's an award winning author, I'm telling you. I'm reading a lot of books lately and to this day I catch a new reference that he made in one of his songs.  Church was another great album and I can't wait for his next one.
This is seriously a top 5 album for me. Everything about woods‚Äô writing on this album is so dense and conceptual; I‚Äôm still finding new things buried in the record which makes every listen so rewarding. The features on this record are top notch as always, especially since he got EL-P on the album, which is wild(especially considering that woods came up through a lot of that EL-P, Cannibal Ox, Def Jux stuff in the 2000s). Preservation kills it on every beat, and does a great job on putting everything together on this record. This is a personal 10/10 album for me, there‚Äôs really nothing like it.   Very excited for Maps that‚Äôs coming out in May, especially since Kenny Segal is back on production. Hiding Places is a masterful work, exciting to see what the two put out next
Quite possibly my top album of that year. Seismic global taste in production with all incredible penning from the features and himself. This is the gourmet shit I‚Äôve been wanting.   Though not easily accesible for the whip, this shit smacks something nasty when in the ‚Äúbook club‚Äù mood.  Needs more stain on the game cuz honestly, this album is flames üî•
Amazing album, Remorseless is one of the best hip hop songs I've heard.
Everyone on this sub loves this album and I just couldn‚Äôt get into it. Is this a ‚Äúread the lyrics while listening‚Äù type album? Should I expose myself to some of his older projects first?
This album really felt like a collaboration project between Preservation and Woods, and like all the best collabs they were two bodies and one mind throughout the whole thing. The whole work has this dark, smokey atmosphere that I've yet to find really anywhere else.  Personal pick off it would be Remorseless, but the whole thing is just great.
Easily the best hip-hop album this decade, and a new contender for an all-time favorite for me.  billy and co. write some absolutely incredible poetry, but reading the genius page could never do them justice because the beats tell as much of the story as the words.  Everything just comes together flawlessly, and Remorseless might be billy‚Äôs most knockout moment yet.  Incredible album.
Hiding Places is definitely the place to start if you‚Äôre unfamiliar with woods. And yeah having the lyrics up is definitely a good idea. Pull up Genius and like every other bar will have annotations üòÖ. His music is definitely something you take time out of your day to digest and understand but it‚Äôs so worth it
Unless you cant understand what hes saying, id more so reccomend lostening multiple times and uncovering new jokes, references, and themes with each continual listen. If you want someone to beat you over the head with the meaning of the album (and add lots of really good insight) you can watch Professor Skye's video on youtube
For me with billy woods, i find it best to start earlier in his career. He does a lot of referencing to other tracks and uses and reuses and expands upon themes across his whole discography, so much that it can be hard to decipher when youre first jumping in.
Appreciate it I‚Äôll definitely back it up to that album and pull up some lyrics
Hiding places is a great intro but I also think ‚Äúhistory will absolve me‚Äù is a good pick too
Future paid fat paycheck for this one - even a video here üßê
Honestly, I love this type of Joyner. Best he‚Äôs dropped in a long time.
Of course Chief Keef pushed back Almighty So 2 again smh
I‚Äôm looking forward to this Kaytranada and Amine album, I like house music now lol I like their single  Drake is super petty for that Kim K sample üòÇüòÇ  I like Nicki‚Äôs verse on NBA‚Äôs song but I‚Äôm not that into the song . . maybe it‚Äôll grow on me   as a Black woman who loves hip hop I loved seeing that Trina recently got an NPR Tiny Desk appearance and it‚Äôs üî•üî•
"At Kanye West‚Äôs Donda Academy, students ate sushi - and only sushi - every day for lunch (on the floor, because there were no tables), and encountered a litany of other health and safety issues, according to a lawsuit filed by two former teachers."  https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-04-06/kanye-west-sued-over-conditions-at-donda-academy
remember when Soldier Kidd was being blamed on XXXtentacion dying because one of the shooters had a red mask and he posted a picture on IG with a red mask lol that shit was so stupid and probably hurt his career a bit
Sometimes I get salty knowing Once Upon a Time in Shaolin exists and I'll never get to listen to the whole thing
i'm tryna hit the group chat and tell them it's a   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  wrap
I listened to about half of Communist Slow Jams by JPEGMAFIA last night and it was pretty good, some really good songs especially near the start. It does sound a bit dated when he's complaining about "hipsters" every other bar though lol. real 2015 stuff
I think Yachty's improvement came from him actually taking time to craft music for others and playing it slow. Good for him, poland and strike are great
Curren$y needs to link up with DJ Fresh again for another tape. The Tonite Show has no skips.  Round 3 Times been on repeat all morning
If Wikipedia is correct, Drake has released a project of some description every year since 2015, that‚Äôs wild.   Also happy 20th birthday to Linkin Parks Meteora. Where has the time gone?
Drizzy Drake Rogers
[what the fuck did I just stumble across ](https://open.spotify.com/track/2WJHdZhoNQ6wUHPB70N5kF?si=HdeyLbCtQC-d__QKYE9BzQ)  This guy has multiple 30+ track albums of this   What in the hell
Lmao Joyner Lucas put out a song called Ye Not Crazy and then took it down after the Hitler shit
To review what was released yesterday  Daniel Caesar was 8/10 for me, with potential to grow into a 9/10 later in the year, it was a great album and Let Me Go has been my favorite song so far in a while since it dropped and a couple of songs could stay in repeat so i easily see it growing to a 9. Put it second in my list behind Yachty  Rae Sremmurd was a 7/10 it was a bit better than SR3MM (the SR3MM album itself not the whole triple album that includes both solo projects) but what i was missing was that energy they brought in the first two (especially with the first one being on repeat for a while now) and while i see some songs here growing on me like Leans Gone Cold, it wasn‚Äôt as memorable as the first two (despite 2 being a 7 too lol) it was still the 6th best album ive heard so far this year but that isn‚Äôt much of an accomplishment considering i haven‚Äôt particularly loved many albums aside from Yachty, Daniel, 6lack and Larry June  Not a single i disliked the Joey and Drake singles are probably the only ones im keeping on replay though, still hyped for Kaytramine but was expecting a bit more
People on  r/music saying Childish Gambino is a better rapper than Drake is typical Reddit .    I feel like he's most obviously not a better rapper than Drake and I would argue his overall catalog isn't on Drake's level either.
[banger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IaPPTgEq9I)
Kind of an out of the loop question but‚Ä¶    What is the deal with Drake and Kim K? Used to seem like he was trolling Kanye but now it just seems like he‚Äôs pressed for her unless they‚Äôre fuckin on the low? Idk.
Sremm 4 Life was exactly what I wanted from Rae Sremmurd. It‚Äôs a fun listen and the Diplo sample caught me off guard but I felt they did a good job with the hook. Only 2 songs I didn‚Äôt care for were Mississippi Slide and Activate. Glad to have a solid summer album  I had been looking forward to the Chloe album after ‚ÄúHave Mercy‚Äù just because I loved the energy she was bringing and it was a good start to getting excited for her record. Now after hearing it, it‚Äôs just  mostly r&b/pop sounds I don‚Äôt care for. Felt like a chore to get through unfortunately and worst part is she didn‚Äôt include Have Mercy or In Pieces. Not sure what happened there but this album wasn‚Äôt what I was expecting. Might have been my fault with the expectations I had but still disappointed
I wonder what's the next 90s hip hop song to go popular on TikTok, they always suprise me with the picks Lmao
just hit 50 full plays of Search & Rescue, AMA
One of my closest friends just sent me this. HHH has gotta hear this. Do remember that it was listed as I think a Nas and Game collab on a mixtape just to fuck with people. This dude a legend.   https://krakenfiles.com/view/vOMHaol14i/file.html
that drake single is mid but my take is its good for his brand at this point to release songs with the content being him playing the submissive/simp role to an older woman LMAO
I think Curren$y would be a perfect choice for a guest on an official remix of Moonlight by Kali Uchis.
Goddamn I'm glad y'all set it off is my favorite opening line for a diss, might be one of my favorite opening lines period
Transformer off of Futures collab album with Juice WRLD lowkey one of my favorite Future songs
Did the mix on Scaring the Hoes vol 1 change or have my ears just gotten used to it?    I swear it‚Äôs easier to understand danny and jpegmafia now than when the album dropped
Three Mach features on the new Fahim project woo
I swear the multiple meanings behind the song [spread eagle cross the block](https://youtu.be/DjJW9K9pPTk) is so interesting to me   I know there has to be others, but what are some examples of a song that at face level is about drug/sex addiction but is actually about music as a whole?  I can't think of any others off the top of my head but it's such a simple concept there's gotta be more, right?
Has anyone here posted about this fantasy  j.cole kendrick lamar collab mixtape on youtube? It's produced and collabed really well imo  &#x200B;  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQynPesbj3E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQynPesbj3E)
Really wanted to like this new Sremm but it ain't it for me. Their first album will always have a special place to me, but man nothing after it has even come close
Rae Sremmurd sampling Stan on a drill song in 2023 is the last thing we need
Daniel Caesar can‚Äôt miss. I‚Äôm going to run through Never Enough again later. I feel it‚Äôs a step above Case Study, but slightly below Freudian.    I‚Äôm playing the new Meyhem Lauren album now. It‚Äôs solid. Nothing really stands out, but it‚Äôs not bad. I‚Äôll listen again since I‚Äôm also preoccupied with something else.    The new Jay Worthy & Blu track is dope.
The Mayhem Lauren, Madlib, and Muggs album was alright but kinda disappointing, was really hoping for more but the production was underwhelming and Mayhem‚Äôs rapping was hit or miss
can‚Äôt wait to get hyped for Sosa again only for him to push it back the week before its supposed to drop again
Will the daniel caser album make me feel depressed? Cause my girlfriend left me a couple days ago and i wanna start getting better and not feel depressed
Jansport J is a producer I really enjoy but don‚Äôt see mentioned too often. Any rarely discussed or up & coming producers you all like right now?
Wanna hear a verse so shitty it's funny? Check it this random ass dude that apparently had enough money for a Cam feature  [24 Hour Ism - Lethal Feat. Cam'Ron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuY5RRdyHeo)
Daniel Caesar‚Äôs album is beautiful. Needs more attention for sure
this Wam SpintheBin kid the best thing to come out of Florida since Glokknine
I really fw that new Rae sremmurd album. ADHD Anthem goes hard
If that Amin√© & KAYTRANADA album Is as good as that new single then my AOTY is already a lock. That song has been on repeat since last night lol
Who you think the most popular hip hop artist outside of the America‚Äôs is? Like counting all of north and South America.   Give me your either artist from the Americas you think is most popular outside the region or artist from outside the americas or both.
Relistening to Vince‚Äôs album and made me remember I have to listen to the rest of his discog, i have only listened to Ramona Park and Stolen Youth so far
Does anyone know where I recognise that up and down noise at the start of Daniel Caesar's Always?
Underrated drum sound death grips two heavens
u/Jordanwolf98 i finally checked out Two Zero One Seven and i was sleeping too good on this. i really liked the whole tape. the only thing that was throwing me off was that some songs were quieter than others. i also listened to Thot Breaker and im still not a big fan of that tape.   my ranking for his releases in 2017 are: Dedication, Two Zero One Seven, The W and Thot Breaker
this new drake is a fucking bop
Saw DVSN live last night, it was surprisingly good and much better than the last minute show I saw last year. Great setlist, Daniel sang and performed well and crowd was mad into it. Craziest part was Nelly coming out as a special guest to do a short set, crowd was going wild. It's too bad they don't perform with a live band anymore but overall it was a solid show and hearing joints from the new album live was cool. 7.5/10
yachty > drake > yb & nicki, good batch of singles tho
What do y'all listen to while working out? Been running SCARING THE HOES but could use a change up
This new Forza Rally update + Spotify on the Xbox been absolutely deadly combination the last few days. JID, album, Drama album, Schoolboy Q album, Tyler album, Drake and 21 album, Herbert album, it‚Äôs been such a vibe.  This is how I used to primarily consume albums when I was a kid, playing Motorsport 3 on the 360 while playing iTunes off my computer. Almost 30 now for fuck sake smh
That new Kaytra x Amine single had me listening to Bubba and 99.9% again, those are great records.
Can't say I expected the breakbeat on the new Rae Sremmurd album
People say Drake, Cole, and Kendrick are the big 3 but it's been 2 years since Rocky dropped Sandman and I'm still waiting for them to drop a better song
Here i go use that word i hate but i am they only one that finds the word "mami" used in english songs cringe ? \*looking at you Drake  edit: tought upvote-downvote ratio there. Forget the music, you can't actaully believe a non-hispanic person can say it out loud and not sound cringy lmao
Thoughts on the [Hip-Hop Media Power Ranking](https://www.complex.com/music/hip-hop-media-power-ranking)?  I saw there was a thread for it a week ago, but all the comments were circljerking Budden and Ak at 1 and 2, which is fair, but am I the only one that feels like Charlamagne at 3 is fair? Dude has come a long way since *early* breakfast club days and asking Logic *that* question about his sister.  My biggest problem is Sway and Big Boy being so low on the list. I feel like a lot of west coast artists feel like they made it when they get to talk to Big Boy. Also a guy like [Bootleg Kev](https://www.youtube.com/@BootlegKev/videos) has been giving a platform to a lot of new and up and coming west coast artists and I feel like that isn't mentioned enough.
Are there any rappers that are similar to Mac Miller and Frank Ocean?
crazy to see harry mack getting mainstream love now
The new Quik [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_YVAsHhZZ4) is perfectly titled. Shit is pure class
I'm Ye biased, but the AI covers of him have been amazing.
The kanye AI songs have been crazy but as they start to expand with other artists it's still throwing me off. This Drake one actually kinda slaps, I ripped it from TikTok  [Backseat](https://krakenfiles.com/view/6rgE1XExRc/file.html)
backwoodz compilation with 4 new woods/elucid tracks  fahim album with 3 mach-hommy features  meyhem lauren album with 8 madlib beats  hip-hop is finally alive again after 2408 days
So I found out Ashanti's first two albums were put together by a guy called Chink Santana. This dude also worked with Jim Jones, who himself with worked with French Montana's Coke Boys, home of Chinx Drugs.  What the fuck is wrong with the rnb/hip hop community that racist names like that are considered acceptable at any point.
where's the new fahim  edit: nooooo it's a paid release fuck  edit2: nevermind it's on youtube
Rap music has gotten so bad over the last 6 years, wow
Can someone suggest an album similar to Apollo Brown's and Philmore Greene's Cost of Living?
Rip trouble, Edgewood is one of my fav albums no skips
Damn I didn't even see that. I really wonder what the reason is at this point
Big Sosa fan and it was dropping the day after my birthday so im sad :(
Is he ever dropping that album with Mike Will?
SHOUT OUT TRINA!!! SOUTH FLORIDA LEGEND
Trina too underrated.  Da Baddest Bitch, Diamond Princess, and Glamorest Life one of my favorite 3 run albums from any artist. Glad to see her up there
That was actually the first time I heard about that guy.
I'm comforted by the fact that it's probably not that great
From what I remmeber, it turned out that it was mostly a Cilvaringz project  there's no reason to think it was any better than *A Better Tomorrow*
[take me off the market take me off the map](https://i.imgur.com/yrWiUhN.jpg)
Poland doesn't really fit your point though, considering it's a freestyle he made for fun and he didn't even want to release it, he just dropped it because it leaked and blew up on tiktok. I wouldn't be surprised if Strike is a similar situation.
Nice to see a fellow man of culture here
Facts bro, crazy production all over that tape, love Funny Money  He produced [one of my favorite Payroll songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1cqt0sorTU)
Tonite show tapes are always fire. I fuck with the Jay Worthy x Mitchy Slick one
Drake's really only had 2 "off years" (no projects) since 2009 starting with So Far Gone, and even then he still released a bunch of singles / features in 2012 and 2014. He dropped 0 to 100 in 2014 and that song was everywhere
Good lord life was different when meteora dropped. You kids hve no idea. about 60lbs different üòÇ
Meteora was the first CD I ever bought, loved that shit
Toilet Time 2 is a top 3 project from 2020 and Silly Poop Songs is an actual classic don't talk shit
Imagine having a son and he does this
Dump Gawd: Lil Big Stack Edition
Lmao wtf üò≠
I‚Äôm calling the cops
It's stream spamming so when little kids search up funny words on spotify theres a decent chance on of their songs comes up and they get the revenue if streamed
looks like drake and kendrick finally have some competition
Awaiting the "Ok Ye's Crazy" follow up
Everybody stays quiet about George Soros hes like a boogeyman you can't speak about
ehh subs like r/music and r/movies are filled with people who have very little knowledge of music and movies, so it‚Äôs not surprising
People tell me I underrate drakes rapping but I definitely think hes above glover lol
Drake would rap circles around Gambino tf
I really like Gambino but give me Drake any day  I know Drake has some stinkers but Gambino only has one great album. Drake has at least 3 and that‚Äôs being pretty harsh. Community is a great show but it doesn‚Äôt mean Gambino has a better catalog than Drake
Gambino at least seems a lot more creatively fresh than Drake for the past 5ish years. Gambino isn't as consistent though by a mile
How good is Royalty?
Childish Gambino makes F tier music. He‚Äôs a good actor tho
I agree Drake is a better technical rapper then Gambino for sure, but I think Gambino is a better overall artist musically. To me he‚Äôs more creative and versatile than Drake and has taken more risks in his career which I respect. I get the take that because he‚Äôs taken more risks there‚Äôs larger room for error, but to me I prefer Gambino‚Äôs misses vs Drake‚Äôs misses because at the very least it seems like he‚Äôs trying harder than Drake. Take Honestly Nevermind for example, sure he‚Äôs trying some relatively different but the album sounds like he put no effort into it. This all just my opinion tho.
especially on the internet people like Childish Gambino or Chance The Rapper are overrated as fuck
I can see both sides personally, mostly just cuz Because the Internet is better than Drake‚Äôs entire discog imo  EDIT: I‚Äôm not saying that Gambino is a better rapper than Drake or that Gambino has a more consistent discography overall. I literally just prefer BTI as a full album over any single Drake album.
This album and Black Mafia Life by Above The Law are some of the best early 90s rap u can get
Never heard of these dudes before, reminds me of NWA
He gonna slaw her down
Probably fucked. Drake really stringing it out to troll Kanye imo.
I May be wrong but I think this started around when Sicko Mode had dropped. Rumor was the the directions he listed on his verse was from his home to hers/theirs (Kanye and Kim‚Äôs). Kanye also tweeted about it. That‚Äôs where I‚Äôm assuming it began
Swae Lee a cheat code
TikTok has such a weird way of choosing what songs that go viral.
Has de la soul gotten a viral hit on TikTok yet? Since it just got put on streaming I could see some pop up
I don‚Äôt go on it what are some 90s song that blew up on there
do they just randomly get used as a sound that blows up or is it from those "here's a classic you should check out" accounts?
not 90s but i bet something off stankonia is gonna blow up there, the whole tape has that sort of over the top personality that social media loves  maybe humble mumble or gasoline dreams idk
Do I need to send a search and rescue party to come find you?
Is there a Nudy remix not out yet that you‚Äôre hearing early?
Okay
My dude what in the hail was that abomination üíÄ   Was not expecting that beat
üî•üî•üî•üî• Idk what tomnook talking about
Kim being like 5yrs older barely qualifies her to be "an older woman" for Drake in that sense imo but yeah lol
Submission is under rated
I think it did get changed but yea even after like 2 days I felt like I just got used to it
it did yeah
That GZA song. Called 'Gold' I think
I couldnt get into it. first two albums are amazing at least
Swae Lee does that hook really well though
I'm listening to it now. I lost interest in that Daringer album he dropped last year like halfway through. Thinking he might just be better as a feature guy  Yeah this album is whatever af
lineup sounds like a recipe for mid honestly. No way madlibs putting his best beats out for mayhem fucking lauren lol
I enjoyed big money I thought that was pretty fire. More the beat over the rapping but the rest of the album wasn‚Äôt memorable
I mean he hasn't done any promo so far right, and it's dropping pretty soon. So maybe not worth getting hype in the first place
if she dumped you then dont listen
Marvin's Room
I know you‚Äôre not askin but New Mode by cudi might be good vibes for you rn
Kal Banx is probably my favorite producer that can be considered up and coming
I've really liked all the stuff Steelz has done, especially with Big Sad and Compton AV
i've been checking out some more mutant academy music and all their producers are great, especially graymatter and ohbliv
evilgiane is getting a lot of deserved love but the rest of the surf gang roster + associates is pretty nice, mainly eera and harrison
Gotta go with Fortes, here are some tracks hes produced:  Mach-Hommy & Tha God Fahim ft. Big Cheeko & Juju Gotti - [Bunny Ciao](https://youtu.be/8LkG5k9LQ1A)  Your Old Droog - [WW3 Freestyle](https://youtu.be/6C_w9cLQOEY)  Mach-Hommy & Tha God Fahim - [N****s Sooooo Good](https://youtu.be/PBAVywzMc0E)  Your Old Droog & Tha God Fahim - [Wall St. With Briefcase](https://youtu.be/xwcaaNJgupw)  Your Old Droog & Tha God Fahim - [No Days Off](https://youtu.be/vIC49yHmJBc)  Mach-Hommy ft. Sam Gendel - [Wooden Nickels](https://youtu.be/58GjIoetjWw)  Hus Kingpin ft.

Ugly Boy Modeling - [Printed Out Mapquest Directions](https://youtu.be/wYMTdNsMgsU)
I know him from working with Hit
Skywalker, producer out of Toronto who produced Booggz' last two albums. Some tracks I like:  [Sorry 4 Tha Wait](https://youtu.be/x4lILFQBSUQ)  [Epiphany](https://youtu.be/89oC0B53fT8)  [Goodbye Good Ridance](https://youtu.be/Q101mdzIQLE)   [Snapchat Best Friend](https://youtu.be/E4VHsrFV1HI)
Well that might be one of the most annoying beats Cam has ever rapped over.
that verse from Ism was traaaaash
jid x metro and utopia still coming out
Here where i live as in american rappers probably Drake, 21, Future, 50 Cent, Eminem, Kendrick, Kanye   Now if we‚Äôre talking our language as well then Eladio Carrion and Myke Towers if we‚Äôre talking more rap/trap
probably one of the BTS guys
Central Cee
Rels B from Spain
pnl are def the biggest in the french-speaking world
Adele, right now Rosalia is very popular she's from Spain
The best is yet to come then
big fish theory and summertime 06 are essentials for sure, i like all of them though
Self Titled album is dope
Yeah that Shit is dope asf and really is slept on by everyone tbh. With the vast majority of it being produced by him, Lex Luger and Chop it was no way it couldnt be hard. Mixing always seems to be a bit of a problem with his music that isn‚Äôt the big albums (4NEM, finally rich, Thot breaker, back from the dead 2 or 3) like even songs like Glo Gang Arena or Off Wit his head off some of the leek and glo flies sound bad despite being great tracks imo   Thot Breaker has some great songs to me. Alone, the intro is what I want from melodic Sosa, along with Couple of Coats, and SoCal just because of his 2nd verse and how crazy that beat is and I even like Whoa oddly enough but the OG Thot Breaker just blows it outta the water. After those tracks got leaked I knew the one that dropped had no shot of coming close to the hype. You got any tracks of it that you still go back to?
I keep saying I don't like it but that shit has been stuck in my head since the snippet lmaoo.
The bar is on the ground
It's been stuck in my head since last night. I actually fuck with that metallic vocal effect he's using. I think it fits with the aesthetic of the song.
I'd def see dvsn. That sounds dope
Joey's single > Drake & yb & nicki  Haven't heard Yachty's yet tho so I can't judge it
Thug Motivation 101 - Young Jeezy, Summertime 06' Vince Staples, Trap House 3 - Gucci Mane, $oul $old $eparately - Freddie Gibbs, Finally Rich - Chief Keef, and Playboi Carti's self titled album.  Some of my go to gym albums off the top of my head
Whole lotta redüßõüèø
Drum n bass or hardstyle. Dnb for when u just in that perfect zen mood and hardstyle for pushing to the limit
Pac, The House is Burning, Yeezus or get rich or die tryin are my go tos
A bunch of Griselda shit
XXXTENTACION hard shit
Mostly memphis tapes. Have had Lil Yo, Lil E, and N.O.D. tapes in rotation lately. A little nu metal and tatlor swift to cleanse the palate too
Mostly City Morgue and Pop Smoke and then just random hype songs sprinkled in
I‚Äôd slightly take Privileged Rappers over Sandman but Sandman is great. Felt like I was back in 2012 again in a good way lol
song is so beautiful
I thought it was a old song  he really made that two years ago?
That's a hot take for sure
He's a better rapper than Cole and Drake and makes better music than Kendrick
I think alot of Spanish dudes use that word
I honestly thought he was saying "mommy" at first.
I'm fine with Cali rappers using Mami
No power users?
Bro no fucking Sway is so low on this list. The disrespect
Wish there was some more legacy picks like Stretch & Bobbito and Big Tig
What era of these two artists? I might have some stuff
Isaiah Rashad for sure  MIKE  bLack Party maybe for Frank  This dude [Lowkey Luke](https://www.youtube.com/@low.keyluke/videos) heavily imitates Frank but is pretty good. Has some songs on streaming under the name Lowkey Luke and also Luke Brown
Idk about ‚Äúsimilar‚Äù but some suggestions: Earl Sweatshirt, Isaiah Rashad, Jonwayne, Marlon Craft, Quasimoto, MF DOOM
Earl Sweatshirt, Tyler, Vince, Domo Genesis
Earl Sweatshirt old stuff
Ben Beal - Birdland  Kind of similar to the point of biting Mac but if you like macs music you'll probably like it
Where?
He has a crazy amount of subscribers and views good for him. Although it‚Äôs a different lane from your typical hardcore hip hop fan. He‚Äôs doing better than Watsky was at least
I didn't even know he performs live really and his upcoming show in May in Toronto is completely sold out. The venue only holds about 2K but that's still more people than I would've thought would pay to see him live
ngl I was expecting Drake rapping "ALL MY LIFE I WANT MONEY AND POWER"
Ok, I'll bite. What happened 2408 days ago and where have you been that you think hip hop has been dead for that long
Shrapknel is such a good track
...you're speaking about a gangster rap group Coke Boys that regularly raps about murder, drug dealing, pimping, etc and this is the part that crosses a line 4 u?  Rip CHINX & Stack Bundles btw. Free max b.
Wow it's like 20 years ago was a different time I'm outraged
At least he put Berserko on streaming
The features are pretty mid imo
L
I love when people who have never been to the Daily Discussions come with the most basic and dated ass takes.    Actual Rap fans don't really say shit like this.
lol wtf is this brain dead take. Tell us you don't actually listen to rap music without telling us
weak bait
Do better
It was way worse in 2016 than it is now
Nah rap is at its peak. The first wave was back in like 2016 when Tyler and asap were dropping fire and chance was on his game, Joey badass dropped some fire, but since then it‚Äôs only gotten better. I think now there is so much of it, that you hear a lot of bad stuff but there‚Äôs also a lot of good stuff. In general just way more music. It‚Äôs like that across all genres right now too not just rap. We live in the golden age of music thanks to Spotify, YouTube, SoundCloud, Applemusic, and every other service that lets no name artist put their stuff out on a platform without a record deal
I don‚Äôt even think he had any intention to drop next week tbh. There was like zero marketing from him or his team about it so I think a few of us had figured it was getting moved back again. Problem is I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs gonna be the last time it gets moved back either
Shit I hope so. I want another Glovtoven tape too
well ya know a few weeks back I mighta said Florida is influential and what not . . just saying üòÇüòÇ  Florida is my home team soooo ya know üòéüå¥
MIAMI REPRESENT!!
BIG FACTS . . . I genuinely enjoyed this acoustic version of her well known songs, her Tiny Desk was short though but it was perfect start to finish . . . I wish it was available on Apple Music
Me too. He actually makes some pretty good music
On discord someone who‚Äôs semi legit said it sounded really good but I‚Äôm skeptical
It was always a Cilvaringz project and it‚Äôs really misleading that Wikipedia says it‚Äôs the seventh studio album from Wu.
2014 also had a young money album, with trophies
> don‚Äôt talk shit  Lol
Nice pun
idk why this made me laugh so fucking hard, well done.   I was thinking when I was looking at the profile "do these types of people tell their friends and family what they do?" Because they shouldn't, just out of courtesy
I already called Joe Biden
This makes sense, I first heard of these guys just typing "poop" on spotify out of boredom and listened to some of their tracks out of curiosity  EDIT: nvm i was thinking of a completely different poop themed artist than what was linked
Wym
Eh, I will give you music but r/movies is a pretty good sub and nowhere near the same level as r/music.
Yea I feel like even if you don't think Drake is an outstanding rapper, there's no way you think Childish Gambino is any better. Lol
I agree that he definitely tries to be different and unique. I can't knock him for that.
Imo, just because it's different and more creative doesn't make it particularly better.   I've actually never understood that standard for music or for favoring an artist just because they have taken more risk.
This comment might've been true in 2016 lol
Chance underrated if anything else these days
In what way are these 2 similar
This is so far off base lmao
I don‚Äôt like this place why do I keep coming here
Ehh, maybe it's my bias opinion of thinking Childish Gambino and that album are really overrated.   But I think NWTS and Take Care are definitely better.
Call It What U Want > Illmatic
Man A Lesson to Be Learned is in my top 3 fav 90s albums, maybe my top 1  I can see how they influenced Larry June
many are saying this
I don't even think he smashed, he just knows that Kanye thinks he did and is using it to his advantage.
It probably would have if the magic number was on streaming around the time it was on Spiderman
the most recent one was Captain Save A Hoe by E40 lol I think
nah give it until tomorrow and this is going to be my least favorite song of the year due to burnout. happens often
need pi'erre to remix this beat and give it to nudy expeditiously
I'm still trying to figure that out myself.
Lmao one of the few opinions of your's I disagree with.
anythings better than going the other way for him rn lol
I just googled it and read the description and that's so neat.  It's about using drug dealing as an allegory for how wu tang broke into the music world   I guess I never paid attention to the lyrics before. Need to relisten to that album
isn't lean supposed to be cold
I love his verse on [Velvet Cape](https://youtu.be/TRErXK6PlNg)  I honestly think his rapping would have been good enough for the album to be good but the production was lacking so it‚Äôs not all on him
He's 100% a feature guy. Always liked his delivery but his albums are mostly very average.
>No way madlibs putting his best beats out for mayhem fucking lauren lol  That's brutal
Who is he putting out his best beats for?
Sure but he‚Äôs one of my favorites out there so i‚Äôll naturally get hyped about anything he drops
Thanks imma get to it when ill be better
remember when I showed you Big Sad 1900
Lol I'm saying shit was so bad it was making me laugh
massive hopium with that Utopia there (I need it too this year)
Where you from?

Damn never would have thought of him but maybe
>hip hop
I didn't realize rosalia was so big even knowing her since 2019 until the coke came out, made me do a huge double take   Too bad that coke is hot ass
Adele the singer or different Adele?
no wonder all of these beats are so good, i heard all of the Turbo tags but i didn't know he was working with Chop during that time either. looking back now i didn't realize how much work Lex Luger has with Keef, all of their songs together are fire.  Thot Breaker has some good cuts but i find the other songs just way too slow for me. maybe it didn't click yet. those OG tracks were just too good.. Know She Does, No, and Don't Love Her
You are now listening to the champion sound
whole lotta red
got any playlists or specific recs?
Yeah it had that early Rocky sound but as a rapper you can see an evolution even tho  live.love is great
Beat is heaven sent
Yeah he starts with RIP Eastside Steevie, he says "Record an album with Mercedes, let GQ EQ it"  [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExmMp08sAVU) is the making of
no it‚Äôs old but he never released it until two years ago
^(Don't say that outloud but I agree)
Every word of this is cap
Correct me if i'm wrong but i think it actually translates to mommy in english and it's just the whole context that gives it another meaning (?)
I'm fine with everyone using lol but most of the times i hear it i can't help but think of prodigy's "it ain't bangin" line from the Quiet Storm lmao. I can't quite explain it but especiallly with this word i feel like the delivery gives away whether they actually use it daily or not
Probably 2016-2018
you mean mescalito remix? shrapknel is a duo
i still haven't listened to that but i was promised a mach-hommy feature today and haven't gotten it
i need more relistens but 1000hp is great to me
Lol I've been in these threads since 2012, nice try gatekeeping "Actual Rap" though
Oh I can promise you, without a shadow of a doubt, my knowledge of the genre dwarfs yours. I can promise you I've been listening longer and more frequently
lots of people fell for it though
I don't think that's in his list of programmed things he's able to do.
Hell nah lmao one of the best years for rap ever  Edit   - tlop   - untitled unmastered   - blank face   - birds   - Jeffery   - coloring book  - suns tirade   - 4yeo   - blonde  - views (I hate it tho)  - evol  - prima Donna   - atrocity exhibition   - 3001   - rtj3   - sremm 2   - savage mode   - collegeove   - ss3   - everybody looking   - cozy 1   - Hamilton   - bottomless pit   And those are only albums. I'll do one for mixtapes If I have to. Who tf actually think 2016 was a bad year
What improvements do you see? In my opinion not many new acts have blown up since then. Style hasn't changed all that much, and the music just seems more diluted
It really bothers me how it seems to be getting fumbled in general. If they market it well it could really be a huge release
Yeah.
Cilvaringz isn't a terrible producer, he's had some good stuff on Wu related projects over the years. I liked the track he did with Rae and Ghost "Silver Rings".   I don't think its impossible for a rando with access to coordinate a decent Wu album. Hell, Remedy did last year and he's a fucking terrible rapper lol, but he managed to collect enough Wu verses and beats to make something decent. Guys like Andrew Kelly and Mathematics have done a better job than RZA curating Wu compilations in recent years.  With that said, any Cilvaringz Wu project is just trying to capture an old feeling and tracing a blueprint rather than giving something new. So while that album might be decent or even good, it's not likely to be great. *A Better Tomorrow* may have sucked but at least RZA was trying for something different. So this Wu head will rest easy knowing he might never hear it.
Thanks Obama
yeah there's actually quite a few of them lol competing with each other. there's a similar stream spam strat where you do name-related songs (like happy birthday n shit) trying to make like 100 different versions of the same song just with different names to get streams
He's a banker with unlimited amounts of money that donates to exclusively democrat causes
actually you‚Äôre right it‚Äôs way better than r/music, but it‚Äôs still a giant echo chamber of sorts with very little place for a meaningful discussion, and pretty vanilla taste.   also it‚Äôs a terrible sub for having opinions that even a little stray from the masses or those that are not complementary to whatever the hivemind considers a good movie.
both have one decent project that was well received by mostly the same group of artsy college kids (because the internet & acid rap) while the rest of their catalogue is shit/mediocre
‚ÄúOff base‚Äù from what lmfao  Not everyone shares the same taste homie, that‚Äôs what makes art interesting. Comments like yours literally contribute nothing lol
Saying anything is overrated while comparing to Drake is typical Reddit
Fair enough, NWTS and Take Care are pretty overrated to me tbh, IYRTITL is fuckin flames tho
'my stereos bumpin that A-T-L funk, u can call it what u want, either way the shit bumps' - eazy e, gangsta beat 4 tha street
‚Äúhidden hills bags full of 100 dollar bills, joggin past your wife and she get chills‚Äù
Gotta admit Drake just doing an easy troll that gets Kanye is the funniest thing.
That‚Äôd be funnier for sure. I used to think all the mega celebrities slept around but I guess not
Good, was a bit worried about you there lol.
On the one hand I can‚Äôt imagine living in any reality where I don‚Äôt like this song  On the other hand yeah you‚Äôre probably right
he heats it up like a glass of milk before bed
I have nothing against him but he's like a D teir rapper its just fax
idk, not mayhem lauren lol
I'm thankful for it everyday üôèüèª
astroworld just clicked for me in november of last year so i'm riding momentum from 2018 right now
Panama
this would make more sense if they weren't rappers when they do solo work but le excellent reddit response friendo!
Rap monsta is one of their names he definitely raps. J hope got that song with J Cole too.
you know half of them are rappers right
>I will be the melody, the rhythm, and your rhyme   >   >All I want is for you to be mine, mine  bars
>reddit moderator
I hope he doesn‚Äôt quit using that tag because of the producer Turbo who I fuck with as well. That shit is really unique for Sosa and I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôve heard it in a min   Yeah Know She Does is amazing there was no touching that on the one that dropped. Raw was really good too I think maybe on the one that dropped he went too far into an almost pop style whereas the OG one was almost like a Nobody type album
https://youtu.be/ExmMp08sAVU?t=231
- a moon shaped pool is similar to blonde in depressiveness and has that epic type vibe but it's rock   - Bryson tiller and Brent faiyaz make similar music to blonde   - wild heart by Miguel felt like a precursor to blonde   - danglo is different but still worth a mention if you like frank   - masego might hit the vibe for you too   Most people have that era of Mac covered already itt.
Listen to NDL2 or Let‚Äôs Make A Deal
Yeah I was to quick to judge, Butter Levers is really nice too
Yet you still are this dumb. At least back up your take if you're gonna say something like that lmao.
And you didn't expect to get downvoted and criticized heavily for this basic ass take that has been said about rap music since like the internet has existed?   >Rap music has gotten so bad over the last 6 years, wow  Not trying to gatekeep but , your a actual rap fan and your not tired of comments like this ?
Least dorky r/hhh user
spoken truly like some1 who started listening to hip hop in 2016
i disagree, was looking through the rym hip-hop top 100 yesterday and it was pretty weak, especially compared to 2017, 2018 and 2022
Wow, not a strong list
He might really like Detroit scam rap or ny drill
I mean that is every sub on this site let's not pretend it's not. I can throw in the daily how I think Drake sucks and his new single that people are considering good is another in a long line of terrible Drake songs and that would get downvoted to hell. Aside from a few Redditcore musicians this sub is pretty vanilla on what is considered good and aligns with the masses.
I mean opinions are opinions but there‚Äôs a point where it‚Äôs just wrong
Is it? You see people saying artist are overrated compared to Drake on Reddit?
actually he took "texas tea" literally and pours a line in a nice cuppa earl grey
Agreed, I would love to hear him just drop some fire but I‚Äôm still waiting
ive been running the Rodeo train for months after a while of not listening to it so need it before it goes out of steam
having listened to just dynamite no i did not know that
need AdeLib
Thanks, man. I'll definitely give them a listen
When he said something so stupid that it pissed you off that‚Äôs how you know he fucked up lol
I don't think I've ever seen his username lmao. Were ddts even live in 2012? That was the backpack era here, I thought they started around 2014

I think he comes here to troll. Quickly glanced at his previous comments here and has only commented 2 times in 4 months, very heavily downvoted takes on Kendrick
I didn't say anything about expectations of downvotes or criticism, that would be sad.  And no, im not tired of people pointing out the obvious... It's a hell of a lot better than the pretending
Late 90s for me
Who tf actually cares about rym nerds. I'm on that site and would never take that seriously especially for certain types of hip hop, like the ones that dominated in 2016   Those dumb mfs have tpab over ok computer even
Wtf wrong with the ddt today üíÄ I can do all the mixtapes and stuff tonight too
Or he might like Tyler, the creator. Best we let him answer the question directed at him rather than throwing out wild guesses and speculation
I don‚Äôt think thats an apt comparison. Rhhh is in another stratosphere when compared to Rmovies, even tho it‚Äôs still far from good (I agree in that part).  I mean I could throw in the daily how Ether is overrated or how Kendrick is trash or something and I‚Äôll bet there will be people who agree if you make it constructive enough.   But try going into Rmovies and say that Hereditary or EEAAO are not that good and you‚Äôll get showered with downvotes, even if you write an essay about it.  I know it‚Äôs not a great comparison neither, but you get the gist of my point. I think rhhh is miles ahead of Rmovies, but people who spend more time in both may disagree surely.
Very bold to defend debatably the most popular artist of all time  I said I could see both sides in my intial comment my guy, I do think that Drake easily outraps Bino any day and that he has way more great projects than him, I just personally listen to and enjoy Because The Internet more.
No, drake sets the bar for overrated so high, that when another artist is brought up and the reply says they're overrated it's laughable
As someone who drinks a cup of Earl Grey every night, this sounds exceptionally gross.
consistent with the train/steam metaphor, respect
getting too deep lol but the City itself
True.
Or that's how you see how insecure someone is, that they have to resort to namecalling when they hear an opinion they don't agree with
I'm not sure, but it wouldn't surprise me if they started around 2013/2014 or something, I feel like here in 2012 based on what I've read from then, the mods probably wouldn't think of something like the DDT.

Lmfao, "quickly" went thru 4 months worth of comments.. how's that unemployment treatin' ya?
> Those dumb mfs have tpab over ok computer even  Not that insane of a take tho? Comparing the two is silly anyways due to genre but it's more of a preference thing at a certain point. I'd take TPAB without hesitation.
it's the best way of looking at a comprehensive list of releases imo since wikipedia lists usually don't have many underground artists. the ranking doesn't matter
We Got It from Here and Atrocity Exhibition are the only notable rap albums that year
Jesus you are annoying dude
But you don‚Äôt even make sense just in this comment you say drake is the most popular of all time, uncompromisingly a better rapper, and has greater projects  But then double down on internet being better than drakes discography
[removed]
I'm literally at work lmao you can search sub specific comments yk
That is an insane take. Okc completely changed music. Tpab did not
You're looking at a user based ranking from the biggest music shnobs on the internet. And saying that means it was a bad year. Come on, be better  Edit wait I'm looking at it right now and this isn't even remotely a weak list. Wtf are you smoking? Have you listened to *any* of these? And this is like 90% underground too with barely any of the mainstream mega albums
Horrendously bad bait  Yeah bro I only listen to real rap not Mumble shit like young thug, Uzi, runthejewels, frank ocean, Kanye, and Vince Staples ü§Æ  don't even get me started on that shitty Kendrick guy!
>*goes out of way to be argumentative with someone*  >"Jesus you are so annoying bro"
Bro, are you okay? I really don‚Äôt understand why you‚Äôre being so pedantic.   I personally believe that Because the Internet is a better and more enjoyable overall album experience than any INDIVIDUAL Drake project. I‚Äôm not saying Drake‚Äôs discography is one long fuckin album and that BTI clears it all lmfao.  Making a (IN MY OPINION) better album than another artist does not make you a better overall rapper, and it also doesn‚Äôt mean you have a more consistent overall discography.
oh nice lol yeah coolest thing about the City is most of us know each other
[removed]
Can you link to Grinch name-calling? I need to screenshot that for archival/museum records
Yeah but what if you like how Kendrick‚Äôs albums sounds better?   Stupid when people try to agree just to align with a popular opinion
>Okc completely changed music  And? Isn't rym supposed to be subjective? Isn't the preference of one album to another also subjective? OK Computer is an all time great album and so is TPAB but I'd rather listen to TPAB anyday. Not an insane take whatsoever and to be mad someone personally holds TPAB over OK Computer is pretentious.
Naming those names doesn't mean anything when everyone you named other than Frank Ocean (not a rapper) 2016 album is towards or at the bottom of their discographies
That wasn't even an argument. I legit just listed the 2 big new rap sub genres because that would explain a lot lmao
[removed]
That's a pretty shitty cop out imo. I hate how the younger generation just completely ignores what okc achieved
I love how you dropped the actual argument completely and now only care about rym ratings
üòÇ   That's false dichotomy fallacy right? Or am I mixing up which fallacy that is?  Edit wait - bottomless pit, coloring book, Jeffery, suns tirade, 4yeo, ae, rtj3, srem 2, savage mode, collegeove, ss3 are bottom ranking albums to you? Bruh   Lot of fans ride for tlop and birds as well and I've seen arguments for uu being top 3 Kendrick
Read it again
[removed]
What‚Äôs the cop out? Why would someone say they liked something better because of influence, probably in a genre they don‚Äôt really care about?
I can see the influence an album has had and still like another one more  Like if i‚Äôd like music just off influence i‚Äôd have just The Beatles and Pink Floyd albums in my top 5 albums of all time
Yo what in the fuck are you even talking about? I didn't drop any argument. You tried to bring up "OK Computer changing music" when that isn't the sole metric which anyone will generally be ranking music by.  But sure, since you want to talk about how much OK Computer changed music, I'll admit is a very influential album but that doesn't necessarily mean more people are going to prefer it. Citizen Kane is the most influential film of all time, but you better believe I'd rather watch The Departed. Which brings me to my original point, which was stating that it isn't an insane thing to believe more people prefer TPAB over OK Computer.

High quality trap is when it makes me feel something and sounds good to my ears. (Lil Pump 1)  Low quality trap is when it's boring or sounds bad to my ears. (Lil Pump 2)
Low quality trap is annoyingly repetitive and lacks substance. It sounds like the rest of the industry bs. High quality pushes the boundaries and actively advances the genre.   Low quality - Lil Pump High quality - 2017 Migos (Culture)
Album slaps (to be expected from anyone signed to PRE) but has one of the worst album covers I've ever seen.

Can't believe Ace Hood has fallen so far that there are zero comments on this. A decade ago he was huge. I still listen to his Body Bag and Starvation mixtapes...now he's got Benny as a feature and not one person is interested? SMH

I thought with Benny the Butcher there would be more hype. I listen to a lot of hip-hop in the gym so I always look forward to Ace Hoods releases.  He did just put out a new Body Bag mix tape on sound cloud within the last 2 months
This sub has changed where they don't really fuck with his style of music.
Can‚Äôt gloss over Millyz either. Should‚Äôve included him in the title. 3 killers on the track
100% that's also when I listen to Ace. I don't care for the Millyz guy personally, but yeah I thought Benny would garner more interest here. All this said, I wish it was a harder Ace song. Some of my favorites are like... Piss em off, We on, Solemnly Swear, Jamaica, On right now, etc..
I love to add hiphop to my gym playlist. Never heard of Ace Hood before this track. What‚Äôs his best release?
Starvation has a ton of good songs. I have some of his newish stuff on my workout playlist now, like Finding my Way, Confident and We Ball, along with Hustle Hard, Go N Get it
Hustle Hard Remix and Bugatti would be the most common suggestions.  I like We Ball and Confident for bench day. Slow, but gets me hyped.  Undefeated, We On, Out Here Grinding as well
Thanks. And full projects?
Mr Hood is my favorite, but I'm not sure that's a popular opinion this was his first without a record label so he didn't get a ton of publicity.   Probably "Starvation", "Blood Sweat & Tears" and "Trials and Tribulations"
I think I remember liking Starvation 2 the best
Gutta
Mozzy and lucci do not miss üî•üî•
Probably the best song on the album
Definitely highlight for this album
this is insane
Whole album is surprisingly decent!
One of my faves so far
Nym Lo too slept on
this project is SO nice
Statik got a hot streak going for a minute now. Dude rarely misses on production
Facts dude can rap his ass off
This dude toured with Isaiah and it's nice to see him in this video. Hope ARDN gets a TDE stimulus.

It‚Äôs going to be a hit mark my words, it‚Äôs a real R&B song it has a nice hook, the instrumental is real smooth and jazzy and Joey delivered with his vocals . I feel like this song is going to do well for what it is and that‚Äôs Mainstream. Joey been wanting to broaden his fan base and do other things with his artistry and I think this is the song that‚Äôs going to check those boxes . (yes it‚Äôs nothing too crazy, but it‚Äôs a good introduction to the new R&Bada$$ era)
I love Joey but he will never put out anything like Christ conscious or 95 till infinity again. His delivery was so much better back when he wasn‚Äôt tryin to be smooth. Mans fell off for sure
This isn‚Äôt really a new era the songs 4 years old
It won‚Äôt be a hit, Joey can‚Äôt get a hit for whatever reason
You're an idiot
New era in terms of Joey transitioning his career into a more R&B route and less rapping, and I think this song is a good introduction to that
Hmm I respectfully disagree , both devastated and love is only a feeling we‚Äôre both hits that did a lot for him in his career.
LIOAF was not a hit, it just got oddly popular with casual fans
That‚Äôs a good point I can see that but devastated was for sure a hit though and I put lioaf there because that and devastated is 2 of his biggest songs

That billy woods track at the end is insane. Also the Breezly Brewin one wondering if it means he will do an album on backwoodz (Like Cavalier who apparently has one coming there).
Let's gooo ! Good looks. This only on band camp yeah??
Stocking Caps and Slick Watts. my lord. shit is so good.  Tar Baby and Read Ur Bible also go crazy. Can't wait for Maps and the AH collab coming later in the year.

For those that don't know, Sidhu and Burna were working on a mixtape when he was still alive
RIP Sidhu Moose Wala. It sucks that such a young and influential rapper was killed by gang violence. His legacy will definitely live on in all the artists he has and will continue to inspire.
That 5911 tractor moving alone üíî
Sidhu the üêê
young goat
That rebirth track is crazy , my fav sidhu track
It would‚Äôve absolutely blown up.
Was technically political assassination
was it leaked and if so where can I watch it lol   but does it have the possibility of ever being formally released otherwise I'll wait for that to come out
It was in burna boys insta story when sidhu paaji passed away   Also as per his dad ,  each and every unreleased track will come out officially within a gap of certain of certain months as they want to keep him alive with his music   Man's got more than 50 tracks ‡ºé‡∫∂‚Å†‚Äø‚Å†‡ºé‡∫∂  Anyways here the rebirth snippet https://youtu.be/bdhUQLuu76I

Doesn‚Äôt matter who you are or what style you do. If you rap, Future will find you. And he WILL collaborate with you
Look I‚Äôm always in here supporting Joyner even if the song sucks because I just hold out hope one day he‚Äôll return to 508 form  But this is actually is best song in 5 years, and Future obviously did his thing  I finally have hope.
Hard. His best in a while.
> Used to wanna get rich like Hov, until I met Jeff Bezos  Hard  > Heard that was your wifey, I turned her to my whore  Fuck u, Future lol
It‚Äôs a pretty fun song. This is the best Joyner song in a while and future was fantastic
Talk about wasted potential, along came joyner was solid and 508 was great. Ever since he's been trying to be more and more mainstream where he sounds either sounds like a watered down version of his old self or a knock-off of the feature artist.
I preferred when Joyner sounded like Joyner,  This just sounds to me like a Drake song.
Sigh
Generic Lucas striking again. Future verse was pretty good tho.

First thing I have to say is ‚ÄúI just heard a hater just got shot, now I‚Äôm grinning‚Äù is one of the funniest lines I‚Äôve heard in a while. Now for the cringe wall of text:  This song isn‚Äôt *bad*, at least, compared to a lot of other stuff Joyner has dropped. And even that hurts to say, because in 2017 I would have told you (naively) that this dude was one of the best out and his 508 mixtape was one of my favorite projects to drop that year, and 2017 was a pretty stacked year. But ever since he blew up with I‚Äôm Not Racist, his music slowly became more and more generic and uninteresting. Songs like Keep it 100, Ross Cappichioni, and even I‚Äôm Sorry are what got me into this dudes music, and it‚Äôs really disappointing to see Joyner abandon that stuff for a significantly more boring style.  Like, I‚Äôm not saying I *only* want storytelling tracks from this dude. I don‚Äôt need him to go back to the rippity rap ‚Äúfuck mumble rap‚Äù shit he was on in 2017, but I do want him to stand out. A few years ago I would‚Äôve said he stood out, even if he could occasionally come across as a little corny and had a bit of a ‚Äúrap savior‚Äù ego. But now it feels like he totally lost any style or uniqueness he had years ago and makes music that is at best, above average, and at worst, horrible. Only song from him that‚Äôs dropped since his Eminem feature that I can actually say is a straight up good song and one that I occasionally return to, is Revenge, and MAYBE Ramen and OJ because it gets stuck in my head from time to time (despite me not actually listening to it since it dropped). This song isn‚Äôt bad, like I said, but that‚Äôs all I can say. It‚Äôs just ‚Äúnot bad‚Äù, and I used to expect so much more from this guy.
where‚Äôs the logic x future joint then
I've been listening to him since Along Came Joyner, but I think we've seen his best already. 508 carried my whole summer that year and was a great project. His sound just hasn't progressed at all, and the move towards mainstream trap didn't help either.
Sounds nothing like Drake other than the beat
Drake lite
keep it 100 is timeless
2025
He doesn‚Äôt gotta be exactly 508 I just want listenable music
His delivery sounds like Drake, especially how he ends the lines at the beginning of the verse. Tons of rappers imitate Drake nothing wrong with that though
For those curious, this isn't TECHNICALLY fresh. On top of being a track worked on during the Meteora sessions, this track was included on one of Linkin Park's fan club membership CDs, specifically LPU4 back in 2004.
Love the way the guitar sounds on this beat
Yeah, a handful of the demos are from various LPU tapes but very glad to get official Streaming releases of them.

I would say he‚Äôs a top ten most influential figure in rap music
Oh man
Who owns it and when can we get it. Probably with some new artist features plastered on
Does he? Will it be Eazy on these songs or AI??
It makes sense that he‚Äôd have songs with Guns & Roses. Some of the direction and influence around Niggaz4Life was inspired by them.
I got luv 4 dem gangstaz
I‚Äôm so looking forward to hearing this‚Ä¶if and when it ever comes out.
Without debate. He set the standard for the rap label ceo basically, next to Russell Simmons
I wish. I'm surprised we're just hearing about this now.   Crazy how Eazy E/NWA (along with Too Short and DJ Quik) totally got me out of my metal phase. Prior to that it was Iron Maiden, Metallica, etc. Went from watching Head Bangers Ball to Yo MTV raps literally overnight once I was exposed to rap.
I heard about the Eazy / Guns N Roses collabo some time in the 1990s, probably around the time that *Str8 Off Tha Streetz of Muthaphukkin Compton* dropped in 1996.  It's even mentioned in [this *Washington Post* obituary from 1995](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1995/04/19/in-the-aftermath-of-tragedy/2c715a12-a813-4ecf-a658-f413f5a775f1/)
I actually wish there were more tracks in the vein of Real Niggaz Don‚Äôt Die.
Wow! Great find. That's a good read.
I know there were references to the Eazy / Guns 'N Roses stuff in other publications in the '90s, hip hop magazines that aren't archived online, but that was the easiest one to find.
This joint IT man.
DC deserves more.  Song is so good.
Best release tonight
so underrated it hurts
Fr. He needs to do more collabs, he‚Äôs so fucking good but rarely works with anybody. If he just doesn‚Äôt fw the industry I respect that, but damn he could be so much bigger
A track with uzi üî•
That would go crazy. He‚Äôs going on tour with $not in a couple months, hopefully they collab on a song
Bruhhhh I hope. I'm tryna pull up to that tour tooüî•
Already got my tickets for the Minneapolis one. It‚Äôs 5 hours away but idc üò≠
Absolutely crazy that these are getting to see the light because at the time of release I was damn near impossible to find instrumentals of any of the songs. Also criminal Bimmer never got the respect it really deserved being hidden on T‚Äôs classic Track 10 dual song track. These beats transport me back to some of my toughest times, I still remember getting bullied for liking Tyler during this era crazy to see where he‚Äôs at today being a household name.   Side note: Anyone remember when Wolf dropped there was an ad on iTunes saying it was Tyler‚Äôs first studio album completely ignoring Goblin.
Trashwangggggg!!!! Woooahhh!!!
Getting the instrumental to Bimmer is the most excited i've been about music in a long time, getting bumped all summer for sure.
It's really cool to see the 180 Tyler's done on releasing instrumentals of his.  I remember back in the day when he specifically went out of his way to make sure that the instrumental versions of his songs didn't surface, because he didn't want a bunch of rappers jumping on his beats for freestyles.  But now, I think specifically with something like Wolf, it's really cool to appreciate the nuances and whatnot in those beats, early on in the process of him transitioning from the edgier shock value stuff to now.
What a high school classic this was  Excited to run these instrumentals, the production still holds up even if a lot of the bars don't
My personal favorite tyler album, this introduced me to hip hop and helped me fall in love with the genre. I‚Äôve learned to love each and every track on this album since listening to it on and off the past 10 years. Even treehome lol. Awkward is underrated af. Maybe in a billion years we‚Äôll see another Earl or Hodgy collab.   Fuck Steve Harvey.
Oh he‚Äôs definitely gearing up for a new era
Wow look at that Bimmer gets it‚Äôs own track finally
Tyler has grown a lot since this came out but it‚Äôs still crazy to see how good some of the songs on this album have held up since it released.   Rusty, Treehome95 (this shit *slaps* man), 48 all dope. Instrumentals will stay on repeat for a few days in my crib too.
Loved how he just silently dropped this. WOLF is my favorite album of all time, so I really appreciate finally getting official versions of these.
Takes me back to math class in 2013
Oh, nice. I still think Wolf is Tyler‚Äôs best album. I remember thinking how cool it was that he scored a Laeticia Sadier feature at the time.
10 fucking years wow I still remember hearing this shit when it leaked. Still my favorite album
OMG FINALLY
Thought he'd never release these. This is huge
I heard someone say Carti was taking up the mantle as hiphops next big superstar but god damn it I think Tyler is the heir to the throne
would be the best tyler album if igor didn‚Äôt exist. love everything about the instrumental style of this album
Whoa wtf. WOLF will always have a special appreciation from me. This is insane considering Tyler said he would never drop the official instrumentals.
Bimmer snippet had us in a chokehold I was half mad it wasn‚Äôt a solo song but there isn‚Äôt really too much to it so it makes sense to be on a 3 part song
People were bullying you for listening to him in the *wolf era* ????  Jesus all the high schools in my area were flooded with OF stans (3 schools I'm talking too)
TRASHWANG NIGGA DATS WASSUP
‚ÄúMIGHT FUCK AROUND AND BE A GOAT NAMED FELICIA‚Ä¶sorry got a lil excited. It‚Äôs probably all the meth that Walt Jr. provided‚Äù  the most 2013 OF line ever lmao
Yeah I was about to comment this. He was adamant on never releasing an official instrumentals because he didn‚Äôt want other rappers over them so I was surprised that the title included it lol Then again he also said he would never use samples in his production and then he changed his mind on that too.
Hi shoutout from the battlerap community üòÄ always respect your knowledge of the scene and I almost always agree with ur takes on Twitter and the sub
The bars definitely hold up
Nostalgia trip..... woo !
college classic for me haha   this is my favorite tyler project
White+suburban combo wambo
awkward and other OF love songs from this era were the soundtrack to my first relationship
Isn‚Äôt it a 10th anniversary thing?
Yeah same, grade 11 me was soooo into this album. Then by 2014 I thought it was lame ‚Äî I used to cycle through music way quicker. There're still like 5-6 great songs on Wolf though
What music video was it attached to again? IFHY?
Oh for sure, I‚Äôm from the suburbs in the south and the OF wave hadn‚Äôt reached the area yet. People here weren‚Äôt really even keen to Frank until like 2017 lol
he always had occasionally used samples which was why it was confusing when he‚Äôd diss people for sampling
Thank you so much Prelec, I deeply appreciate the kind words.
Saw him on tour with Earl, Taco, and Jasper in Chico. [Here they are Performing Blade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdq1wBUfzX8)
Between Estate Sale & this drop, it's starting to feel awfully like he's catching our attention for a new announcement
It was @ the end of the domo23 video I‚Äôm pretty sure
Wait when did he even say this cause on either goblin or bastard he‚Äôs talking about how his samples are too illegal.  Crazy to see how far his production skills have come though from the relative simplicity of bastard and goblin just to wolf and then cherry bomb dude progressed at an amazing speed .
That‚Äôs what im thinking or he‚Äôs just getting out some albums for contract requirements and renegotiation. Actually looking at it. It might just be a contract thing and maybe he does a like a retrospection tour and then drops whatever persona he‚Äôs creating at the end .
he drops an album every 2 years, and has been very consistent about that.  guessing the album coming later this year, probably a couple loosies this summer, etc
I swear I heard this song like 3 years ago
Didn't find out until digging into the credits, but Billie Eilish and Finneas are on this one.
This has been on tiktok for like two years right lol?
You did, it was in Euphoria in 2020
Labrinth has been kind of in this bag sonically since Euphoria. Very spaced out, organic, using little vocal sounds percussively.
Yeah; it was unreleased for a while (not even on any of the Euphoria soundtracks) until now, since it finally came with some involvement from Billie Eilish and Finneas.  I‚Äôm glad Labrinth was able to save it for his own album anyway!
I don't use Tik Tok, wouldn't know. Labrinth has a new album on the way, maybe he has been sitting on this one for a long time and finally putting it out.
It was in season 2, so 2022
It was in Season 2 as well but it was originally in the special episodes that released December 2020 and January 2021
i speak for EVERYONE when i say this is the highlight already
Only thing that sucks about seeing a Young Thug feature is that it makes me think it might be the last time I see one. Free Thug.
Just shit on my ex now that‚Äôs a royal flush
Swag, terrific! üëçüòé
I thought this shit was so good until that recycled and overused bullshit poop line, absolutely ruins it for me. I think the idiocy of it plus that arrogant flow is just too much for me
Beautiful beat. Some good flows on it. Awesome
Some real Squidward vibes with the beat. Horns go dummy hard.
AYY YAYAYAYAYAII
???? he's not dead bro
He makes great music and all   But like some dudes should be going to prison for crimes.   We can‚Äôt just free all our favourite rappers
>Swag, terrific  I might fuck this bitch in the kitchen (bih)   Baby don't use dirty dishes (no way)   Or else you might whip up a brr (brr)   My neck, my wrist is a brr (woo)   She wan' fuck my dawg I'm like, woof (woof, woof)   Panoramic roof, I drop the coupe, boo (damn)
I‚Äôll take comments I never expected to read for $1000
I dont think theyre gonna let him record new music in prison.
Carti beats up a pregnant girl and a week later people are worshipping him at rolling loud waddya expect
The man has 1000s of unreleased songs I think he could put together an album by just telling his people what songs he wants on the album.
>Got a phone in jail, that‚Äôs a cell phone. -Lil Wayne   Can‚Äôt wait for grainy trebel boosted thug verses to change the game
Even if he died today he has shit tons of music recorded, there are still features coming out with Juice WRLD even thought it's been 3+ years since he passed away, same goes for X
Better.   I expected better
Look I am definitely hoping they go the gucci route, which they easily can, but I dont think I see it happening without him being under 1017
Huge disagree, I have like 600+ Juice leaks and most of them are great
Juice and X sound more like reference tracks all them shits are ass
Maybe X, not juice lmao
Why are there 2 songs from his album on here? To bump the numbers or something?
The "Holster" part should've been the hook, or atleast repeated more times, thats the part that holds the song together. Idk why they decided to mix the melody lower and use the "strike" part as the hook, which is not catchy at all. The track had some potential tbh.
I wish there was an outro with this sister
Very smooth
Although the pink floyd album was nice, this was what i rlly needed. Glad the snippet fatigue didnt hit me cuz the final version of this track is fire.
Glad to hear him rapping more on this
yachty been rolling i feel like the next few years gonna be huge
Fire
Yachty really dropped a fucking grail yo.
Lived up to the hype
if he makes a whole album like this it would be his best
s tier yachty
It‚Äôs a gun in my HoOoOoOolsterrrr
I really don‚Äôt like this. Not hating but damn this was not for me at all
Best song to drop tn
Yachty seems to be on a hot streak, he‚Äôs had a great 2023üî•
Is this a forum where I can talk about how much I love Diana Gordon‚Äôs vocals?
Video drops tomorrow too. Can‚Äôt wait üî•
Yachty's on a fucking roll, man. He can't miss
Why soberman Yachty always talkin about doing drugs these days. Poser yo.
like this song more than the album sorry not sorry yachty
Sounds like lil baby
I had snippet syndrome on this one
Finally
I‚Äôm sorry but Yachty‚Äôs music does not last more than a week
More streams
my exact thoughts, its fine but if done how u said i think it would've gone harder
fr
She‚Äôs probs gonna be in the music vid
onggg
Sounds like he's trying to tap into the magic he stumbled on in Poland and I'm really glad he's exploring it. I think there's more there to this sound still.
fr man. so happy for him too. crazy how talented he is
To you, and other people, sure. He still streams super well and has a good sized fanbase.
L take, he dropped the best album this year
I just don‚Äôt think he really has the voice for what he‚Äôs trying to pull off. Cool to see him try something new but still just not sounding very good
Fax
I previewed all 3 just so I wasn't rushing to judgement. Absolute trash.
I figured. Weird he chose those two songs, there are way better songs on that album imo
I thought that was a meme song
This is an even bigger L take, it's a good album but not the best of the year by far if you listen to other genres
bro doesn't listen to any genre besides rap üíÄüíÄ
Black seminole is top 3 on the album minimum and drive me crazy is probably the most streamed song on the album after black seminole
they are the 2 w the most streams so
Those are the two he played on SNL
Those 2 are my favourites tbh lol
everyone i get into this album seems to pick ive officially lost vision!!!!
Cap Black Seminole is def the best song on there
believe it or not liking an album doesnt make you closed minded. Ive listened to over 80 albums from this year and yachty made my top 5.
listen to others still my best
0 logic here but ok
You couldn‚Äôt be more wrong but ok lmao
Tbh its my album of the year so far, its hard for me to choose the best songs off it
Oh ok well that makes sense, I can‚Äôt see the stream numbers on Apple Music
Should I Be is one of my sleeper favorites
I‚Äôm not gonna say you‚Äôre wrong cause it‚Äôs a great song
pretty is my favorite fasho, but drive me crazy and officially lost vision‚Ä¶ jesus i luv da whole album in general
Say Something, Lost the Vision, whould I B going straight into The Alchemist that transition is crazy
Here here brother
Yup that whole run of songs is so good
This song is so ass I can‚Äôt even put it into words. Loved their other 2 collabs but YB is unlistenable to on this one.
This guys garbage.
10k all day üí™üèºüò§
Did not expect this to be so good. Shits so messy in a great way. First beat, the sample drums are hitting way out of time with the programmed hits. And he‚Äôs still riding. Not a fan of the second track, but the rest of this is  niiiccee.
first track already slaps with such a nice intro
Real hip hop lmao
what do you mean by [Real Hip Hop] ?
Not the real hip-hop üò≠

they say rap is like a mountain
Dude wtf
Let me know if you find it
Soundcloud
Audiomack
Anything you would compare him to?
Lol what if people honestly thought ‚Äúreal‚Äù hip/hop was the omission of topics that most closely relate to the human experience when the genre is really just the evolution of how those relate to the artists making the art we all enjoy. That would be crazy. Appreciate the laugh.
I can‚Äôt take the credit for this one lol it‚Äôs a classic copy pasta but fr. It‚Äôs like to some people ‚Äúreal‚Äù hip hop is the most handicapped inauthentic version of it
Sometimes it‚Äôs handicapped by the very same topics you listed also though.
Listening to this first.. madlib always a treat
Damn I'm smokin to this tonight
Gems from the Equinox and Frozen Angles were both amazing  Black Vladimir is amazing  Really excited for this
Goddamn "Big Money" is nastyyyyyyyy got me like üò≤
Surprised I had to scroll quite a bit to find this post.  First of all, this is a CRAZY collaboration of artists!  Madlib & Muggs alone is just impossible sounding to me, and Mayhem has been putting out consistently solid music for almost 10 years now. He definitely has great producer connections as well as great flow and lyrics. I was pretty excited for this album as the 3 singles were all hits in my book.  I've only listened twice but I already know I will be listening to this to and from work for a minute.   One of Them Ones is my initial favorite. That beat is ridiculous. Can't wait to listen to that one in the car.  Great beats/switches are no surprise but still surprising somehow. Things flow together nicely and tracks are dusty and crisp at the same time. Nearly every track is sounding like a 9/10 to 10/10 for me... however  Not loving Holographic Rhetoric. Not hating it either but I may skip that one eventually, as well as Quicksand. I get it's the intro but it just gave me a weird vibe? Everything else on the album was impressive and lived up to my expectations.  Very solid work imo. Will listen more but most likely not update my post üòÜ
my notification said \[FRESH ALBUM\] Madlib, M...     nearly dropped my phone
Am I trippin or is the first verse from OD Wilson from another lauren track?
Never listened to a full Meyhem project, though I've enjoyed his features. Is this a good one to start with?
Absolutely criminal this has only 4 comments. This is such an insane project.
üî•üî•üî•üî• if you don't know meyham, now's the time! never disappoints
This one is crazy so far, at first I felt like it sounded too much like muggs and was a little grating if you were expecting a more Madlib sound, but I feel like this one will require a few listens and sit on it for awhile, Szechaun Capital being a huge standout, an absolute onslaught of heat
So far I'm at track 8 and only evolution has Madlib credited as producer... Its all muggs. What is Madlibs contribution to this joint?
This is the album of the day to me. Excited to listen
Invazion SZN
This is really good man. First time checking out a full Meyhem Lauren project, heard him on Big Syke when that dropped so I was looking forward to this. I really like his voice, reminds me of Rick Ross in the sense that they both feel larger than life when they rap. Another fucking album to add to the rotation, what a strong year this has been so far.

Everyone is in top fucking form here. MORE NOS!!!!
Does anyone know the name of the dude who does a lot of the interludes on Meyhem's stuff? Haven't been able to find who it is since gems from the equinox. He's talking on sandbox
Mayhem is coo, just kinda wild to me that out of all the artists Muggs & Madlib could‚Äôve collabed with they chose him.
This absolutely delivers God damn
This feel like dusty beats muggs & lib had laying around to anyone else?
ITS THE MADLIB
I can‚Äôt lie, not feeling Mayhem at all on this one.
Pretty dope album, though sad there‚Äôs no rapping on Triple M Airlines because that‚Äôs a great, but super old beat
That‚Äôs an all star lineup right there, you already know this is getting the first listen tonight!  Edit: wow these switch ups on Szechuan Capital are so damn clean
tbh the album is mad dissapointing  we the ones is a craaaazy beat but somehow meyhem manages to ruin it  big money and szechuan capital are nice but the rest is boring af  both producers never manage to make their style shine and most beats sound like old throwaways compared to their other work  and meyhem is just not a good enough rapper for an album this long...only so much you can say about eating and silk shirts. also does he have a second flow maybe?   3/10
Man I wish there was a better rapper on this instead of Meyhem. Madlib is always incredible as expected
Meyhem underrated asl
Right there with you fam
The exact first thought I had ü§£ü§£ü§£
fr me too üò≠
This whole project seems cobbled together
Black Vladimir released last year is fantastic.
Check both Glass and Glass 2.0 all produced by Harry Fraud. Got me into Meyhem
Bronsons verse was wayyyyy too fucking smooth, killed that shit with the Islam makachev bar
Sunday Driving, Midnight Silk, Evolution, Wild Salmon, Triple M Airlines, African Pompano, Pop Clink Fizz  He produced half the album.
Midnight Silk and Sunday Driving as well
Yeah I‚Äôm gonna be bumping this , Sremm4Life and Skinemaxxx this weekend lol
So was madvillainy (not muggs of course, but madlib beats that were collecting dust)
I feel that may be the case but I'm not mad at it  Grandmasters gave me that vibe too with Muggs
So many switch ups on this thing.. it's so exciting to listen to imo
I agree with this rating.
That's what I originally thought.. didn't know if I could sit through a whole project with Meyhem. Madlib and Muggs managed to bridge his raps nicely with gritty and soulful production. Oh. And beatswitches alot of those here . Love this album so far 8/10
bro that intro made me uncomfortable lol what a way to set the mood
Gonna check this project out too. Thanks!
Fair, but let‚Äôs not put meyhem in same box as DOOM.  I‚Äôm guessing madlib did not have a lot of direction choices on this record either
not true. they stayed together in a house and madlib would hand Doom tapes fresh off the press.  https://pitchfork.com/features/article/9478-searching-for-tomorrow-the-story-of-madlib-and-dooms-madvillainy/
Some of the beats yes, but a lot of the album was made by madlib shipping boxes of his beat tapes across the country to doom in Georgia, who would then pick the ones he liked, record tracks to them, and send them back  I believe they only recorded a few songs live while in LA at the bomb shelter, the majority of the album came together remotely and not with beats made specifically for the project.  Peep the new 33 1/3 book on the album for more anecdotes.  Pretty fun read.  They get a lot of these details from Walasia who helped facilitate a lot of this remote beat choosing process.
Funny enough, I didn't pick it up because I figured "what more could we possibly know about this damn album?"  That tidbit made me wanna check it out ü´°.
üôå hope you enjoy it man cheers
a verse & a re-written chorus is crazy
üî•üî•üî•
xg are pretty good, cool to see they swept up a remix like that
The homie Khrysis on production. He and Conway have a nice little track record so far
Jesus Khrysis should‚Äôve set the ground for Conway & Khrysis to make a project together. And this joint is further proof of that.  Outside of Daringer and Alchemist obviously, I think it‚Äôs very clear (to me, at least) that Conway works best with Graymatter and Khrysis.
More of this. God DAMN
Machine flowing on this!   Seeing Khrysis on production reminds me of the old Justus League days. That was a different time.  This is dope tho, no doubt
Wasted no time reminding us how good he is too. Conway never comes to play. Need another album like King to God
Conway needs to put out more music asap
Goes hard but it should be illegal to have a 2:20 min song where half of it is a talking skit

cover art goes hard
This is amazing way better than his flow on that single with sauce walka and Juicy J
Gives off super MFdoom vibes. Good shit tho
Does anyone know the designer of the down jacket he is wearing? @ 0:15
They should go ahead & give us a tape already
love this beat
Just wait until all his stuff with JUSTICE League comes out. That‚Äôs who he‚Äôs best with
Damn I'm more of a Big Ghost guy myself tbh, If It Bleeds It Can Be Killed is top 3 Conway for me
Graymatter so fucking dope, I want a tape together so bad
His Justus League days of producing was insane! And I love that he still produces crazy shit to this very day‚Ä¶ low-key one of my favourite producers.
So Much More was a good joint JUSTICE League produced for Conway, so I'm interested in how their chemistry will continue.  For now, I defo prefer him with the two aforementioned producers, knowing the chemistry he's developed with them.
He‚Äôs previewed a ton with JUSTICE League over the past year on IG Live, and it‚Äôs all absolutely incredible sounding
Kim samples made it to the finale version. Wonder who had to clear those
The way he hit american expreeyeeyeeeeyeeeess killed me
Drake has not given a single fuck about mixing since CLB
Sounds like an AI generated Drake song
Might just be because I've been listening to the ripped radio version but the mixing sounds abit weak...
Wtf did he do to his voice? Sounds so compressed and low quality
Is it just me, or is the mix kinda trash on this song?
Drake loves to come up with a great idea for a song and then make it 4-5 minutes for no reason. Enjoyed the first couple of minutes but I was bored of it by the end
12 years after Take Care and still down bad
Aubrey isn't exactly marriage material himself is he lol
I miss hearing THE CHAMPION SOUND, THE NIGHTOWL SOUND, THE WORLD‚ÄôS GREATEST SOUND
Nah, that Kim (okay) adlib in the first verse is fucking cold
This shit sounds fanmade in a bad way lol
something sounds off
idk man‚Ä¶ this is not a good song. Feels like Drake goes hard to beat the no effort allegations just so he can go back to no effort
why doesn‚Äôt drake rap with energy any more. bro just talks quietly over a beat now
Drake and BNYX. We really here.
Is that kim on the cover????
setting myself up to be cooked here but this was one of those drake songs that was incredibly mid on first listen - probably objectively mid too - but got stuck in my head and is now on repeat anyway
Some of these rappers (cough cough carti) need to learn from drake that if a song leaks and there‚Äôs a lot of hype around it they just need to drop it and capitalize on the hype! It‚Äôd be a win win for both parties!
Love Drake threads cuz the haters and dick riders are equally as loud, its peak reddit
why does the mix sound garbage
the vocals seem thin and overly compressed
Mix is distractingly bad
Drake is hit or miss for me and this a big miss
This some ass
Why is the mixing so bad
I miss the old drake
Drake is way too fucking rich to be rapping over this dollar store ass production. I feel like his ambition is long gone at this point when it comes to making music.
I like the mix on the leak more but still one of his best songs recently.
The mix feels like drake just started posting his rap on SoundCloud and is still learning üò≠ Vocals feel weird and honestly quiet
The song has so much potential, but the mixing makes it unenjoyable. Would love to see a remaster right away
hook is stupid catchy
Drake doing all this stupid Ye sneaking as if he wasnt standing there sobbing watching Kanye perform Runaway and Find Your Love a year and a half ago lmao. shits just lame at this point
happy for BNYX man :')
American Express came through with that bag
get in boys  edit: i love petty drake
Drake asking for help
Whether y‚Äôall like it or not this is going #1 just in time for summer
drake is so frustrating to me because if you put the best songs off of every project he‚Äôs dropped since 2020 into one album itd be like top 4 in his discography. but instead we get a tape or two a year where at least 50% of each is filler.  for example  1.) deep pockets  2.) when to say when  3.) chicago freestyle  4.) from florida with love  4.) fair trade  5.) N 2 deep  6.) pipe down  7.) no friends in the industry   8.) race my mind  9.) rich flex  10.) spin bout u   11.) hours in silence  12.) pussy and millions  13.) middle of the ocean   14.) i guess its fuck me   or something along those lines is so easily an upper tier drake album.
I might actually be over Drake and I never thought this day would come. This is hot garbage.
The thumbnail on Spotify is jokes, drake just doesn‚Äôt care anymore
Songs okay. Drake just releases mid nowadays. Not bad but not great either. Just alright. Feels so generic. And the shit he keeps doing with Kim is so goddamn cringe. Just be done with it already, what‚Äôs even the point.
this is actually drakes worst song. what the fuck is going on?  It sounds like it was recorded on his iphone
This song is absolutely trash
I think I like it fam.
meh, not even mid.. below mid.
Sounds like a lazy mix and trash lyrics honestly.
2nd half delivered for the first
bro this made my drive home even more depressing wtf was that
This shit is ASS
So the peace treaty between Drake and Ye is officially over.
worst drake song ever wtf is this
second verse was good‚Ä¶ but then it just went into the chorus again, felt like elevate for a second
This song sounds like it was made by AI, lacks so much in the mixing and lyrics department. Very weird when you start reading into what he‚Äôs saying with all the Kim references and he too grown to be talking about ‚Äútake me out the market‚Äù like
Three producer tags and the beat still boring
i don't even get hyped for new Drake anymore but i see what everybody is talking about. vocals sound flat af but that hook is catchy  edit: 5th listen and i fw it.
i‚Äôve heard this beat hundreds of times on youtube
Drake has all this money and studio resources at his disposal and ends up sounding like the newest trash rapper on SoundCloud in 2013 wtf.
This is the most mid shit i‚Äôve ever heard
How does he get lazier with every album like wtf   This isn't even music for TikTok it's music for bedtime
I have no idea what it is about this song but it‚Äôs so god damn catchy  Like there‚Äôs nothing particularly interesting about it, it‚Äôs not very dynamic, the hook is pretty basic, the beat is nothing special, the mixing is obviously terrible‚Ä¶ but I can‚Äôt help but come back to it like every 30 minutes for another play through lmao. Swear this man Drake puts MSG in his hooks
Sound like somebody testing out a Drake Ai. idk what that autotune or effect on his voice is but it dont sound good and he dont need it
Two statements: im not a Drake hater. This is shit.
This is grand trash. Mix is bad, lyrics are bad, samples mean nothing. Those weird bass lines sound so weird.
THIS SHOULD‚ÄôVE BEEN UN-RELEASED üî•
36 year old man rhyming mommy with mommy 100 times over the worst mixing of all time
1. The mix for this song sounds atrocious  2. Melody sounds nice, but Drake honestly sounds uninspired these days,I know he‚Äôs got some more in him
Another song where Drake sounds bored as fuck, cool
I‚Äôm 3 min in, when does the fresh part start?
tired of drake's corny 13 year old girl drama bait
Can‚Äôt believe he has fans
Who the fuck did the endmix on this? Sounds like no one did?
This is another way that you can tell Drake is so huge. Because if this was someone just coming up, it'd be laughed at.
It's way too long, not my thing can't get into his voice at all.
This is low quality all around.
Voice sounds horrible on this
When people talk about Drake now they judge him as someone who needs to prove their greatness. In life we work so we can have a comfortable life when we finish working, but people in the public eye never get to have fun. Drake releases music every year, consistently. Kendrick disappears for 4/5 years before an album & they judge music that has been made over half a decade with someone who is just having fun & recording random moments in their life.
mid
This is a crazy mediocre song
No Way yall actualy think this shit is good am i fucking crazy??
drake dickriders out in full force defending this mid  you aint all gotta dogpile every negative comment (nugget, gintoki, scuffed etc etc) to influence the narrative we all know its mid lmao
Boring asl
> Don't know how to express my looove  > That's why I American Expreeeeee-eee-ee-eeee-ss my love for youuu  that part hit ngl
shits ass lol
This song is SOO boring and the Kim sample is lame!!! overall just garbageüóëÔ∏èüóëÔ∏èüóëÔ∏è
shitty mix and a pretty boring beat. i dont like whiny drake either.
Ngl I really fucking love this song
Comeeee n rescueeeee me üò©üò©üò© someone needs to fire the sound engineer, great song but poor execution.
This was close to being good. So many small misses
That mix is fucking horrific. But decent song
The clean version on iTunes sounds way better WTF !?
This shit ass üíÄ
Song isn't bad but the mixing is fucking awful.
Sadly the best part doesn't even start till after 3 minutes.
this shit got yachty production creds
Pretty good for a throwaway. I like the additions to the Sirius XM version.
This isn‚Äôt enjoyable‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
I like the overall vibe of the song a lot. Fix the mixing and it‚Äôs a smash
Shit just doesn‚Äôt sound very good
Drake‚Äôs music is lacking something these days - substance
What a snoozefest of a song
I need someone to be patience with me. Chill flow, hard beats, Drake.
This is absolute low effort made in my bedroom bullsh\*t. I haven't been listening to his music fr fr for a minute but I'm definitely outta there at this point. I need people who care about the art and want to make something great. This is literally autopilot laying down on the couch while recording sh\*t
Drake needs new writers ASAP. Yikes.
He's become a parody of himself
Beat switch should‚Äôve been a majority of the song
Second verse is kinda fire but most of this is bad
why does it have this Greece filter ffs
MID
I'm sorry but I cant take "mami" srsly
Trash
this shit hurts my ears
BNYX/SADPONY/40 were in their bag on this one. The annihilation sample/sound is such a nice subtle touch.
poo poo
Drakes' autotune sounds messed up.  The only good part of the beat is the sample and one of the background synths. Everything else sounds way off - mostly the 808s and filler synths  Drake has given up.
This needs that AI Kanye voiceover
Bad song
People hate on anything this man drops , but he been consistent as fuck for like 15 years now lmao.
That was an off-puttingly annoying song to sit though. It sounds like someone paid a dude on fiver to make a drake song. This is some pink season shit
This is so fire.  Dark, nighttime drake vibes
Listen to this version and tell me the person who did the Spotify mix has ears https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eqvBLChWq0
Ngl this isn‚Äôt good  It giving me like Signs vibes that he dropped at the end of his 2016 run I think
such a boring forgettable track. He just had to use Kim K to generate attention and then get all petty and play victim when someone calls out him for the weird corny shit he does
I keep saying it Drake hasn‚Äôt been good since 2015. Even though since 2015 he has made Afrobeats, house, drill and dancehall songs he hasn‚Äôt developed or changed. No versatility. Passionfruit and Nonstop sound like the same song.   He just jumps on trends in pop culture. That‚Äôs why he got Millie Bobbie Brown killed and groomed XXXTentacion.
This is actually shit
7 writer credits and it still garbage üóëÔ∏è
BNYX working w drake is crazy ü•≤
its like alright but im gonna listen to it constantly for the next 3 or so months for some reason like everything else drake drops  edit: ik the ‚Äúok‚Äù adlib gon have me making faces on the train every morning
Shit so bad
Delete this, I don‚Äôt like it.
This is ass
The mixing is weird and I haven‚Äôt liked a drake song in years, but I surprisingly really dig this
I didn‚Äôt cum this far just to cum this far üò´üí¶  Triple entendre don‚Äôt even ask me how
I recognize that the song is repetitive and lacks depth and energy but I love it lol. Sometimes Drake just pulls off this vibe so well. The hook is incredibly catchy, the production is atmospheric and that bridge is insane. I think this is without a doubt a top 20 Drake song for me. People will call me crazy but it has a similar vibe to some of the moodier stuff on ITRTITL imo
Drake‚Äôs music is basically just McDonald‚Äôs at this point
Bnyx beats just be most boring shit sometimes
Man this blows. I can‚Äôt remember the last time a Drake song actually wowed me. God‚Äôs Plan maybe?
To think he went from making great albums like Take Care & NWTS to garbage shit like Views, Scorpion, & CLB. Idk who had a worse fall off him or Lil Wayne. Retire already motherfucker because this ain‚Äôt it!
The beat is really good, but WTF is up with the compressed ass Drake vocals. Drake‚Äôs actual singing and rapping is okay, he hits some catchy flows, but man the mixing is ass. Also why must he drop so many corny bars, holy shit.  ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why I American Expreeeeess my love‚Äù  ‚ÄúI give you the world, but there's other planets too‚Äù  ‚ÄúMommy‚Äù  This man is nearly 40 years old bro WTF is this shitüò≠
RESCUEEEEE MEEEEEE
Cue all the petty losers that complain about Drake being ‚Äúuninspired‚Äù or ‚Äúboring‚Äù
Had potential to be a late clap back for story of adidon with all the ye news lately, but it‚Äôs just another mid drake song smh
The goat on automatic.
It's total shit, as expected. Just like ALL Drake shit.
COME AND RESCUE ME
Favorite part is the ‚Äúcome and rescue me‚Äù. This kind of song you listen to driving slow at night.
Drake bad. Upvotes to the left.
The kim adlibs tho lol
GO BNYX, GO!!
BNYX on fire
i fw this song
This song is firec
I don't get how Drake has remained relevant post 2016  He had a good six or seven year run. Should've hung it up,or,at least taken two or three years between projects
His best song in years.
would've liked this if the mix was better, drake sounds robotic. shame because BNYX usually has some really nice sounding mixes, especially with his yeat beats
Person who did this mix needs to be put ~~down~~ out of work
I swear y‚Äôall just listen to the same shit and have different opinions lol
the mix is really bad  i do like the song overall but the 808s are just way too overpowering
its always something with drake singles man. song would be so fire without the robotic voice
BNYX
Hard
good song, been awhile.
This is terrible.
Most boring hook I have ever heard from Drake and it just keeps going
Lots of potential here but the mix and overall performance kinda kills the momentum. The melody is great, love the mood, actually really like the sparse production even if it is a bit thin. Needs some more kicks I think. Vocally Drake's delivery is flat. Some fun lines in here but lyrics get repetitive. Sounds like a demo but not in a good way. Can't get it out of my head tho
man this is garbage. Drake really can‚Äôt sing for shit
This song isn‚Äôt even bad and don‚Äôt even understand the hate people have towards it lol
Can anyone confirm if that‚Äôs Kim on the album cover?
Drake could drop a classic and mfs would say it's uninspired and boring. sub really is just a vocal minority
I feel like most of the people talking about the ‚Äúmix‚Äù probably don‚Äôt know anything about the process of mixing.  We have all heard a thousand uber high fidelity Drake songs. It is a standard. It‚Äôs one song. It sound different that other Drake songs.  Go listen to vice city by xxxtenacion and tell me how the mix sounds.   Music happens how it happens and it is pretty unreasonable to trash the ovo team because the song sounds like it was uploaded to SoundCloud in 2019z  It‚Äôs still a great production. I feel like y‚Äôall are highly underestimating the creative direction of ovo. You loved it when it leaked on YouTube but now that it is an official release the quality escapes you.   Ok boomer
Drake 36 talking about the group chat. Lol
Is there some Ye propaganda bullshit going on in these comments because I don't understand lmao. This is fire.
Top tier Drizzy no doubt
Definitely using this over a thirst trap on my insta later in the week
I wonder who wrote this for drake?
Richard "Drake" Petty back again!
That notification ding might be the most devious pump fake of 2023
Nah ya bugging, this songs SLAPPSSS
Another banger. He don‚Äôt missü•∂
This shit sticks
I honestly kind of fuck with it, his voice sounds robotic and I feel like he makes it work. Drake is already very AI-coded
Sounds good on my two HomePods üï∫üèΩüï∫üèΩ

Considering he‚Äôs one of if not the most popular artist in the world you‚Äôd think he‚Äôd pay for better mixing
Everyone gonna call it trash but will bump it on the low   (I haven‚Äôt heard it yet)
Trash
fire
comeee annnnd reeescue meeeee
Drake's definitely a come from the back kinda guy
great til the beat switch and then it wears itself out
I hope the next project is nothing but thunderstorm music like this ü¶â6Ô∏è‚É£
I like it.
It‚Äôs too long, I stopped 3 minutes in.
This is auto tuning at its best. Not typical drake
It‚Äôs always the same type of melodies with this guy, bring something new!
Ye gonna snap at those Kim samples, shit
getting an american express ad under this post is what i needed
33443
The vocals sound awful and I don't think I ever need to hear Drake say mami that  many times again.   Side note I'm not sure why but the piano at times reminds me of the theme/intro of a horror or sci-fi show.
I sided with Drake throughout his beef with Ye, but this is next level pettiness.
Literally three seconds in and hit the major NOOO
Sounds like they sampled a song from the movie Annihilation or used the same instrument. https://youtu.be/NCuBalItZA8 can hear the instrument (idk synth bass?) at like 30-35 seconds in the linked YouTube song and at 1:22-1:24 in Search & Rescue.
The beat is nice, the mixing is strange, and the chorus is catchy, but damn the lyrics are so damn unhealthy.
Definitely a drake song
I thought, ‚ÄúOoh Drake finally fell off‚Ä¶‚Äù then I heard Kim, and thought oh boy, he is really taking a swing here. Wow.
Unironically sounds better in a car than headphones or earbuds.
Sounds like an AI song
Drake sound like everyone else now smh.
Did he seriously sample genshin impact OST? It sounds awfully similar to it
Love drake but this one was a miss for me
BNYX must really like using that working on dying tag as a perc, randomly throughout the song I‚Äôm hearing ‚ÄúI-I-I-I-M‚Äù I heard that all over the last yeat album too its kinda dope
That Dale mami line reminding me of ‚ÄúGot so many chains they call me chaining tatum‚Äù üò≠
4/10. This is not a good song to my ears.
Super Mid!
this some hot ass, not good at all, wtf is wrong with his voice, mf recorded the track through WhatsApp audios on a Xiaomi or sumn
trash
Seems like I‚Äôm the only person that thinks this song is pretty dope. His flow on the last leg was pretty cool too
Ya know his subreddit is lovin this
the devil works hard but kris jenner works harder
A fuck load of money probably
The Kardashians love attention and drama, I bet they're all praying this provokes Ye into an IG rant.
damn i was like 70% sure it wouldn‚Äôt be on there
Kim obviously
No way 40 kept a straight face watching Drake do that in the studio üíÄ
that was part was funny as hell ngl lol
Reminded me of SpongeBob doing [‚ÄúKrusty Kraaaaaayaaaayaaayaaaaab pizza, is the pizza, for you and, meeeeeheeeeeheeeee‚Äù](https://youtu.be/67hw7hj_xkc) @ 0:23
Goofy ahh drake
That line is heat lol
Way 2 Sexy has crazy good mixing for some reason.
Yeah idk why though, it has to be a choice to mix it like this because his vocal sounds like it‚Äôs removed every bit of low end and he‚Äôs got no balls lol. And the beat mix is just muddy and terrible, the bass is barely identifiable and the drums are weak.
Can someone teach me how to notice mixing? It‚Äôs always brought up in this sub, but as an average listener I honestly can‚Äôt tell? What am I listening for? That the vocals sound too low compared to the beat?
He‚Äôs gone full kanye
*the future is here*
When I heard the leak that‚Äôs exactly what I was thinking but good to hear I‚Äôm not the only one
Disagree but this is an actual AI generated Drake song and ngl it kinda slaps lol I ripped it from TikTok  [Backseat](https://krakenfiles.com/view/6rgE1XExRc/file.html)
This was my first thought
I agree something about the vocals is off.
So, most Drake songs since like 2015 then?
It probably is an AI generated song
i mean there's no point wasting time going to a studio to record the same song over and over when tech is good enough to replicate it - drake doesn't bring anything interesting that a robot can't copy
They boosted the 808s and did something weird to the vocals
[Radio version](https://krakenfiles.com/view/C8rNW4vfWn/file.html) for reference
Listen to this and Jumbotron Shit Poppin back to back with airpods in an yall will see what im talkin about
It sounds metallic and overall just not as crisp
Ever since Greece he been doing this and I hate it
I‚Äôve noticed this is his default vocal mix since like 2020, zero low end and it sounds like he‚Äôs speaking through a tin. For all the money and equipment Drake has he still can‚Äôt buy a good mix
Sounds like he recorded vocals from inside his car using his phone.
My theory is that it's AI generated and the mix is to support that.
i‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs from time stretching his vocals. when you record a song at one tempo then change it to another, it leaves artifacts that make the vocal sound tinny and a little off. there‚Äôs way to get around it but he must like the sound or something.
yeah his voice sound a lil too processed, i feel like for how simple this melody was it wouldve sounded better more raw
It‚Äôs so garbage, it has to be done on purpose LOL. The leak had better mixing.
Sounds like the leak version to me lol, I‚Äôm used to Lloyd Banks quality lately so it ain‚Äôt buggin me too much.
Dude the mix is freaking me out, it isn't polished like at all imo.  edit: don't get me wrong, I actually dig the track and really love lofi stuff, it's just super wild for one of the biggest artists on the planet.
Yeah it‚Äôs super weird lol vocal sounds like doodoo
Can someone teach me how to notice mixing? It‚Äôs always brought up in this sub, but as an average listener I honestly can‚Äôt tell? What am I listening for? That the vocals sound too low compared to the beat?
Bynx is terrible at mixing songs it‚Äôs a lil weird
I literally just told my gf that it sounds ‚Äúcheap‚Äù I‚Äôll listen in my car later but yeah unimpressed with the mix
Hours in Silence might be the best song on Her Loss‚Ä¶for 90 seconds. The last 4 minutes is abominable.
He just like me fr
But with none of the songwriting or ear for melody
honest. he just said fuck it, knew itd do numbers regardless
The mixing of his voices sounds like he recorded off an iPhone mic
I mean, he recently released Her Loss which is the most energy he‚Äôs had in a while.
Fr he‚Äôs way too inconsistent now. Seems impossible for him to drop an album with songs like ‚Äúmiddle of the ocean‚Äù
Was he not always like this? Lazy flow
He flowin on this lol yal got no taste fr
i love it personally.   only try hards need "energy"   this is harder
Blow a half a million on you hoes im a feminist
Pusha T took it like Moro
This is one of the reasons i say NWTS is the last great drake album
He watches too much porn he doesn‚Äôt got the drive he used to he‚Äôs comfortable knowing he‚Äôll get numbers no matter what
[no but it is a reference to her](https://preview.redd.it/96z4i9o1acsa1.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cd3e50e704845f43b1ffbc7814175e5fd1c4668b)
nah its his ex
Exactly how I feel. Super mid but very catchy
Except Drake song didn't leak... he literally premiered it on the radio
most of cartis leaks are unfinished songs with open verses which didnt do the final cut of an album release.    i have like 30 songs for different versions of whole lotta red. there is no way to release them all lol
I disagree, it‚Äôs lame to me when artists get pressured into dropping something that‚Äôs clearly not finished. This will prob be viral for a week or two and then everyone will forget about it. Like Poland. I think if Carti dropped ‚Äú24 Songs‚Äù as is, his fans would be pissed at him
same here, but i find maybe I'm maybe more of a Drake hater, since I feel disgust whenever I see somebody meat riding him, but not as equally mad at somebody hating on him üíÄ
Lmao on god
4 minutes, who the fuck thinks is him, Kendrick Lamar lmao, might be snooze fest, I'll hear it, so i can have an opinion.  but as it's started wtf is wrong with his voice, recorded it through WhatsApp audios on an Android or sumn? it sound ass
Yeah the one with the ghost writers.
Perfect late night drive playlist track tbh
BNYX is dope, makes a lot of great shit. The issue is that there were probably 99 other better beats than this one in the pack and for some reason every pop artist picks the dumbest, simplest shit out of the bunch
agreed
hey I wonder what happened with Kanye in the past year. Can you think of anything that happened?
Can‚Äôt imagine why drake would want to distance himself from Kanye lately‚Ä¶
the ye glazing is crazy   dismissing the fact that kanye attacked a whole facet of drake (and his family's) identity on a national level
Caping for a racist is crazy
What‚Äôs up with BYNX? Been hearing a lot of support for him and this is the first song I‚Äôve heard him produce. The beats was generic imo plus mixing was off. Any other songs he prod.?
Were goin rescuing
Pause
What was the last good song to go #1?
Fax
Champagne Poetry and The Remorse not making the list? Smh.
Make your own playlist with those songs
I'd be missing a tonne of great Drake songs if he just put out an album with that tracklist so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Ayoo, s/o Deep Pockets that's a classic  Bruh, Pipe Down, Hours in Silence, I guess it's Fuck Me, why we got the same exact taste?
That is shit
It is s weird feeling. I remember when i use to live everything he dropped but those days are over for me. Now i just listen to his old stuff and that keeps me content
I can‚Äôt even listen to his old shit anymore tbh. His shtick has gotten so fucking annoying to me, even though Take Care and IYRTITL basically defined two years of my life. I think it‚Äôs because as a 27 year old I feel like I‚Äôve grown up but Drake never did. He‚Äôs still saying the same 19 year old shit that he was 10 years ago
So most drake songs
Speaking of ass, I thought this was r/ratemypoo but nope, just another dump by drake.
idk drake j scratches an itch he rly like the music equivalent to chipotle no matter how low effort it gets ima fw it cuz it fr j scratches my brain right.
Her Loss was a smash 5 months ago how is he uninspired üòÇ
Her Loss is top 4 drake minimum and dropped not even half a year ago relax
> honestly sounds uninspired  critic buzzwords, absolutely meaningless, armchair psychology nonsense  ya'll can never actually specifically describe what you like or dislike.
Check out his [favorite type of fan](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Fp5b9dW1nrA)
Yea u crazy no worries
News flash: music is subjective
yes -- this will bang in the whip and outside. Not as much on the couch at midnight.
Just admit you not a fan of Drake bro lol weird
Consistent is not at all the word I would use to describe Drake
You think this sounds good? Bruh your favorite artist can miss, it‚Äôs okay.
Consistently mid üî•üî•üî•
Damn that‚Äôs some delusion. Whether you love the guy or not, consistency is not drake.   Consistent is coming out with banger after banger and never missing. That‚Äôs not Drake.
Consistently boring and trash
Signs is a gotdamn national treasure of a summer bop
Signs is an amazing song lol. This isn‚Äôt anywhere near that
U contradicted yourself lol
Nah Signs was a phenomenal summer vibe, this isnt even comparable
Signs was 1000x better than this unmixed mediocre song. This song sounds unfinished straight up meanwhile signs was a lead single worthy song
Hater
Fuck outta here hater
Yea cause Drake really needs Kim K for attention, cmon man..
> Passionfruit and Nonstop sound like the same song.  I want whatever you're smoking
>He just jumps on trends in pop culture. That‚Äôs why he got Millie Bobbie Brown killed and groomed XXXTentacion.  Huhh ü§£
Cause every drop he‚Äôs had from 2017-now has a lot of hits and really good songs
It‚Äôs not
The intentionally kind of shitty mix adds something to the song for me personally. Drake‚Äôs take on lo-fi lmao
Can‚Äôt have friends at 36?
Noted, I'll be 36 in a few years so I'll work on deleting any group texts I'm in. Didn't know they were whack like that
i love drake but this shit trash to me
Wow, as a huge Alex Garland fan I thought you were capping but good fucking ear man. That definitely sounds like at least the same instrument, but it‚Äôs pretty much identical in its chord structure too. You got some supersonic hearing bro
So if Kris wear Prada, Adam, Eve wear nada, I‚Äôm in between but way more fresher~
See Kris Jenner I beep twice and I wave
Kris Jung Un
Drake doing all this stupid Ye sneaking as if he wasnt standing there sobbing watching Kanye perform Runaway and Find Your Love a year and a half ago lmao. shits just lame at this point
Kim was pulling the same shit early last year and then immediately played victim when Ye started calling her out.
Truthfully they both probably laugh at a LOT of drakes bars lmao. They just get to fuck around in the studio at this point and make money.
Nah CLB had great mixing but past that it‚Äôs been horrendous
Tumaye was probably involved?
When you're ego gets big enough, you think you know better than everyone else. Wouldn't surprise me if he thinks he's ahead of the curve with the shit mixing
Nah, the vocals in this case lack all low end (=bass) -> Pretty much all roughness of the voice is lost this way. It also seems quite compressed which only adds to the problem
You don't want to know, it only makes music worse
I won‚Äôt speak on the mix or EQ as much, but his vocals are definitely over compressed and processed. Really listen to his vocals, they sound like they‚Äôre being generated by like 12 different synth sounds to recreate Drake‚Äôs voice. That‚Äôs the compression removing all the subtleties and noise differences in order for it to sound more similar throughout the song, giving his voice this weird buzzy quality.
You don‚Äôt wanna know
I think being aware of the mix comes from listening to a lot of music (in different 'qualities' or standards), and also from producing or recording music.   When you play guitar over the amp it sounds good, but plug it into a laptop and it's incredibly hard to get a guitar sound similar to [popular band]. Now you have the tools and knowledge to get a crisp and brilliant tone, but then you add drums, keys, bass and some samples and everything sounds muddy or thin, like it was recorded thru a microwave.  Metal is a genre where different standards of mixing apply, kinda, death or black metal *stereotypically* have terrible mixes, super muddy or treble heavy, no mids, it's the 'noise' sound. And what makes something a 'worse' mix is the balance in sounds, whether the frequencies of each instrument have a 'place' in the mix (meaning they dont overlap too much).. it also includes eq, compression, other effects like distortion or delay etc and how clear or 'good' they sound.. even the tuning of drum samples or how well instruments/vocals are recorded and processed.  A skillful mixing engineer could use cheap and crappy (or free) tools and instruments and likely still make a near-radio proof sounding song. You and me could sit in a professional studio with whatever equipment and our recording would probably sound stale and lifeless, bland and void of the energy that went into playing the instruments during recording. A bit hyperbole, but thats the effect of mixing and how you'd notice differences in mixes.  So it's definitely subjective in part, but the technical side of it can get quite objective when talking about frequencies and using various tools and techniques to carve out a mix.   Tl;dr - basically the clarity of the song and the individual sounds samples and instruments in it. How they are panned and volumed and eq-ed and the effects on top of it: the whole cake.
Never go full Kanye
Turn the 6 upside down, it's GPT-4 now
why is everyone calling it a leak, did he not play this on OVO Radio?
This is exactly the same as the leak right? I'm surprised it actually dropped in the first place, but even more so at this quality lol
Did they show any part of their process for the creation of this song? Cuz I seriously doubt an AI wrote those bars. Seems written by a human and then an AI used for Drake voice
RDC called this already   https://youtu.be/cV8XvBl4J3Q
This sounds better than anything drake put out in the past 4 years
That‚Äôs just an AI Drake voice no way ChatGPT wrote that on
This is insane. It‚Äôs scary how good AI vocals have gotten. In a few months rappers probably won‚Äôt even have to actually rap anymore, just send the vocals to the engineer & let him work his magic with some AI vocals. It‚Äôs cool to witness honestly lol. Do you know the page on Tiktok who posted it?  This would‚Äôve fooled me completely if Drake posted it on IG and said it was an official release. The lyricism isn‚Äôt how he writes though, but the flow is on point.
Lol you using AI as an opportunity to take a dig at drake as if literally anyone's vocals can't be replicated
Yea the bitrate sounds fucked and there‚Äôs some weird artifacts in there
The vocals aren‚Äôt crisp at all but the lyrics are fire
The radio version is so much better.
Noticed this too. So annoying
Greece is just a low quality demo, the new mixes have thought behind them at least. Probably just noticing more autotune lol, his stuff has been very compressed since views.
It‚Äôs clearly a stylistic choice, an awful one but it‚Äôs nothing to do with bad engineering.
Needs j. Coles sound engineers
Won't be long until rappers actually start doing this sadly
Yeah he didn‚Äôt need the autotune. Song is fire, this is the type of sound Drake is best at. it would‚Äôve been a lot better without the overdone effects
It‚Äôs definitely on purpose.
leak definitely felt cleaner
It works for Banks tho
there‚Äôs a lot of components to it but the general idea of it is that everything is to sound balanced, clean, polished, and competitively loud.   when someone refers to mix as a sounding ‚Äúoff‚Äù it‚Äôs when one of the aspects of the mix is out of balance, common examples are, the bass overpowering everything, the snare hitting too loud and hurting the ears, the top, bright end of the vocals sounding shrill, the melody being too quiet, etc. this is very general by the way, there‚Äôs wayyyy more to mixing and it‚Äôs not to be confused with DJ mixing which is mixing multiple songs together.   in this case, most if not all of drakes low end, which carries rich harmonic frequencies, is cut out which causes his voice to sound thin and over-processed. it‚Äôs a stylistic choice but not a very well received one clearly.
40 mixed it, Bnyx is just one of the producers
No way lol Hours in Silence is great
Last 4 minutes greatest thing on that album. Shoutout to my drained accounts
Lol the last 4 minutes is absolute üî• the vibes are insane  Shit is classic drake. Definitely feels like take care.
Lil bros TikTok brain can only handle 90 sec songs lmao so tragic.
Last 3 out of 4 minutes are great, but it does drag by the end
That song has my least favorite Drake lines of all time lol  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs three sides to this story, the one you subtweet, The one your group chat gets to read, and the one you tell to me‚Äù
Real af
Maybe controversial but I feel the same way about Cameras/Good Ones Go
yessss, if they kept the flow from the first 90 secs for the whole song it would be a radio hit smh the last 4 mins he on the mic moaning basically.
The positive reaction to Hours in Silence was so weird to me because of this. I got bored of it and never revisited the song
40 said he records music on his iPhone in some interview recently, in champagne poetry the vocals sound weird like this at some point aswell
subliminal shot at Jesus is King? ü§£
Right?  Dude just put out an album of bangers front to back lmfao
That‚Äôs true, but imo most of his more emotional/rnb type songs just has him sing like he‚Äôs half asleep. He needs higher effort on his soft shit like ‚Äúpipe down‚Äù on clb.
idk songs like Trophies and Nice For What have him rapping with much higher energy
bro said tryhards as if its 2010 COD üíÄ
what about IYRTITL
lol, Kim's caption: Fast & Furious  Drake's song title: Search & Rescue  Same motorcycle helmet visual.  Yep, they fucked.
Yeah exactly lol that comparison makes no sense. Plus there‚Äôs still plenty of Drake leaks like Big Mood, In the Cut, I Did, Lucky Lefty, that Benny song and tons more that he refuses to officially release.
Poland was a win for Yatchy and it hyped up his album, you're dead wrong.
Shitty take, Drake dropped this on OVO Sound Radio himself and he's done that with multiple loose tracks in the past. People might not fuck with the song but we've got no reason to think it's unfinished, it has a full chorus and 2 verses  Also I think Carti fans would take any scraps at all if he put something on streaming, they don't get fed anything. No clue why you think they'd be enraged at him doing that, that song is fire btw
I get if an artist doesn‚Äôt wanna drop cause the song is unfinished but for example carti has plenty of gems that clearly are finished or just needs to be polished up a bit and his fans would‚Äôve been ecstatic to hear these songs in CDQ
Bruh Poland still a banger
As a fan of Drake‚Äôs music since 09 I find the meatriding really annoying and the hate a lot more entertaining. It‚Äôs more of a testament to me enjoying his earlier work considerably more
Yeah, that one
Drake and Drive!
The rantings of even extremely mentally ill man? Oh wait we only care about mental health when it‚Äôs easy to deal with and not messy. Why even bring kanye up it‚Äôs wack
Bro you honeslty think drake cares at all about that. Why would his response be ‚Äú I fucked your ex‚Äù
This is the opposite of distancing
ok so if thats the issue he should rap about that. but nah instead all he‚Äôs done is make sneaky Kim references for the past *five years* at this point. its been old
Huge reach
They can both be lame
He produced a lot of Yeat, listen to Out The Way or Wat It Feel Lyke
first thing i heard from him was a playboi carti edit he made funnily enough: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tVBrutYYEE  more recently he did a lot of the latest yeat album, nun id change is prob my fave song that he's produced: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vq8EYreJaMs  cant really disagree with you on your take for this drake song but i love a lot of BNYX's other work + you love to see the come up of a dude making youtube remixes to working w drake
He also used to make Youtube tutorials/create content for other beatmakers, so likely his followers are happy to see him succeed in the industry.
Oh you want the boys to get in? That's crazy
Flowers by Miley Cyrus.
7am also IMO
this makes so much sense lmfaooo
Bro you know how this subreddit is. Anything drake drops is automatically trash before they even listen to it
Yea 90% that project def felt uninspired lol, Drake be sounding drained on his records nowadays  Compared to his older music where the hunger was still there. Now of course it‚Äôs easier to be hungry when you‚Äôre on the come up, but it‚Äôs also possible to maintain creativity even while on the top
Stop the cap that project was so mid
Calling something uninspired is a specific criticism if you know what the word means lmao
Buddy def insane but thats okay
Yea you right music is subjective think im done with this drake im out
just admit your a paid drake shill
The irony üíÄ
What word would you use to describe being one of the most listened to artists for two decades?
Mid and still top of the charts. And hip hops biggest artist. Crazy lol
Why you so mad üò≠
He doesn‚Äôt need it, but it doesn‚Äôt hurt either. Don‚Äôt act like you don‚Äôt see how this generates some extra attention
He means that people on social will speculate whether he‚Äôs dissing ye by using Kim.
Am I lying?
Don‚Äôt you know? Only the cool youths are allowed to have group chats. We‚Äôre only allowed to do group calls.   Btw this song absolutely slaps
This better be sarcasm lol
I‚Äôm 31 and still have a group chat with my college roommates. No shame
With way less effort
See bruce jenner and I get the hell out the way
Lil baby my favorite rapper
ngl you immediately lose any beef when you cry to the other guy's song
I dunno as a Jew I can understand why drake would come after that clown
Surely Kanye has said nothing notable that could change Drake‚Äôs feelings about him
You can like someone‚Äôs music and hate them
Yep, kanye said absolutely nothing controversial about Jewish ppl since then
And now the Ice spice shit like the dude didn‚Äôt 1. Not want her on TikTok let alone lip syncing about backshots at the age of 9 2. Make violent crimes
The kardashains are horrible awful people
and then people wonder why the guy went crazy
‚ÄúIm on the roll like Cottonelle I was made for all of this shit‚Äù will forever be one of my favourite Drake lines.
That was exactly my thought when I heard the song. It‚Äôs not good, at all. Feels like he‚Äôs just laughing at our faces because he knows he‚Äôs gonna get a billion streams an a shitton of $$$ even if he farts in the mic for 3 minutes straight.
Yeah true the bass sucks and is distorted on his newer releases. I mean people don't give a fuck and it sounds good on airpods so ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
Nope. 40 was the mixing engineer on CLB.
I think it‚Äôs ego and laziness, he‚Äôs waiting for someone to take the top artist spot from him and nobody is close. I like his older music but u can‚Äôt tell me that he puts in the same effort for his bars, message and overall sound wuality as he used to
Literally stay ignorant it‚Äôs better from an enjoyment perspective lol
Lol yeah
Yeah it sounds the same as the leak
People have been using ChatGPT to write verses then going and using the voice filters/AI to finish the rest. It‚Äôs scary
I predict a human made this song and put a voice change AI over it
Doubt that lol but it‚Äôs def believable as a real Drake song. Will be cool to see how people use it in music
Aligning with the sound of AI to seamlessly pass the baton
it could be just Drake being lazy and recording it on an iPhone or something like that and then engineers work with what they've got. That's something that Kanye has done many times, wouldn't surprise me if Drake does the same.
Aka J. Cole
There's already Search and Rescue with Kanye's voice. Honestly sounds so much better than the original lmao  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw1u\_a4DRMQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw1u_a4DRMQ)
Leak was ripped from a radio show and way more compressed. Pretty sure they already played the final version.
ah ok. The songs were like this on the Yeat album too.
You were lost until meeeee  One of the best parts of the album for sure. Makes it stand out as my favorite song on the album
My guy, I'm 40. I came up with 5 minute hip hop songs. The length aint the problem. It's that the song turns into boring drivel after the first 90.
The radio rip of this song sounds clearer idk why he fucked up his vocals
Subliminal shot at me
Idk if I‚Äôd call it an album full of bangers
3 good songs
Ight chill, it‚Äôs a great album, but 3-4 tracks could be cut out easily and forgotten lol
Man thinks it‚Äôs 2015
Pretty much all of IYRTITL had a high energy too. Even his singing was more powerful.  I do think the soft delivery works great on some tracks though
whats that? is that a game little kids use to play?
IYRTITL was a really good album. Madonna STILL slaps. Company STILL slaps. This is a nasty justification but I don‚Äôt consider that a drake album. I feel like it fits more in the mixtape category; same with What a time to be alive, and honestly nevermind.
Please God let In The Cut be mixed well with Roddy and released. Song is so fire.
I think this song could be great if it had a better mix & maybe a more energetic vocal take. Right now it sounds like a demo.   Carti fans hate when he drops music, idk where you were at when @ Meh or WLR or even Pain 1993 dropped but people HATED those. If he dropped 24 Songs all you would hear is ‚Äúwow he put out a demo from 2 years ago and hasn‚Äôt worked on it since‚Äù ‚Äúthese lyrics suck, he‚Äôs just moaning, not even speaking english‚Äù and their favorite ‚Äúwhy didn‚Äôt he drop [insert name of a different leak] instead?‚Äù He probably has the hardest fanbase to please in hip-hop. Not surprised he wants to ignore them
Never Drake and drive
Damn that stinks
i don't think dealing with mental health issues gives you an excuse to be an outright Nazi repeatedly praising Hitler, no.   And i'm not the one that brought up Kanye, the person I'm replying to did lol.
Agree with you. People want to stand up for mental illness when it's a feel good commercial type of vibe, but not the reality of it. The reality is ugly.
big fax, Drake has been using the same material for a decade. Shit is stale and not elusive anymore. ThE SUBS aRe SO EdGy DrAKe.
Good for Miley
No Friends, 7AM into Knife Talk is a crazy rap run on *CLB*.
Dawg if her loss was uninspired I genuinely want you to pmo to some of the people you listen to
Deaf
Tell me what ur into lil bro
Popular? Literally the most common criticism of Drake is that the quality of his music, and especially his full projects is wildly inconsistent.
Inconsistent
trendy =/= good. see: that annoying ass sam smith song
Topping the charts cause a lot of people are mid-loving npcs
Most people have shit taste, more news at 11
It is
I‚Äôm joking lol
LMFAO
You immediately lose any beef when you're Drake
You can‚Äôt try to win a beef when everyone already saw you cry to his music.
 What?
English MF English do you speak it.
>like the dude didn‚Äôt 1. Not want her on TikTok  >	like the dude didn‚Äôt 2. Make violent crimes  Bro what the fuck are you saying lmao
He also made XTC. Clearly he doesn‚Äôt actually care about purity or not exposing his kids to shit or whatever christian virtue signalling he was on about  Imagine growing up with your father having a song about wanting to fuck all of your aunties. That‚Äôs 10x weirder than you getting to hang out with a famous female rapper who makes art that has a suggestive subject matter (like almost every musician)
I love how many people shit on them on reddit due to jealousy from the fact that they got rich and famous off of being attractive as hell (as well as being smart asf to do all this image building and social media shit)  Sure they are stuck up ass celebs like any other rich person but like they hardly ever are in a negative light or do something "bad" or "cancellable" yet reddit lovessss shitting on them because they are hot girls    why y'all gotta be such weirdos about this specific celeb family? just because they are hot doesn't mean yall gotta get so jealous and salty. Kim seems like an awesome mother from the shit u read in the news
Do you really think he just went off the mental deep end?  Ye is crazy
You can't believe this
Facts. His daughter being raised by Kardashians. Jahannam can't be much worse than that fr fr
ü§Æ
That‚Äôs what the last couple of drake albums felt like
> he's waiting for someone to take the top artist spot from him   ü§£ü§£ On Spotify Drake is 10th in the world rn with 68m monthly listeners. The Weeknd is 1st with 110m. Drake fans really be coping hard these days
yeah but chatgpt isnt putting out verses like this yet
I can see it being utilized a ton for posthumous songs that the artist never finished, but the labels still want to pump out.
he‚Äôs recording with auto tune on, he‚Äôs not doing this on a iphone. it‚Äôs whatever room his vocals are being mixed in, they have a boomy system leading them to cut more low end off his vocals than needed
It's def stylistic. The sound 42 CDQ version is MINT.
He doesn't engineer his own music
yeat mixes his own songs
Bro bamboozled himself not once but twice. It's a L day for u bud
Your ignorance is so glaring
Burnin cash like it‚Äôs lit on fireeee
It still sounded a little off though, I thought it was aome dj stem edit when he first showed it on his story
Well it is
That album (mixtape?) is still his best work imo
call of duty
yeah idk where you are reading this but this is not the core fanbase lol. @ meh was hated first but just look at the youtube comments now and it grew on people. wlr was just twitter bait from people who wanted clout but the subreddit (me included) loved it day one. i even claim that wlr gave him the biggest fanbase he has today. nobody would hate him for dropping a deluxe with like 15 leaked songs. the problem is him lying all the time and teasing shit just to drop nothing. cartis problem is himself also fucking over producers and his friends.
I mean that doesn‚Äôt make it okay but that also doesn‚Äôt mean we completely shun someone for that. I work with mentally ill people, they say some far far worse stuff worse than kanye when they are going through an episode. If you actually encountered serious issues like this you‚Äôd understand to help you can‚Äôt just bash them and push them away, you need to realize it‚Äôs not their fault for the majority of what they do
Only someone completely unaware of what Nazi Germany was like would ever say Kanye is an outright Nazi.
Shits wild.. people really believe Kanye West is a fucking Nazi. Like the dude is wearing swastikas and saluting Hitler while murdering jews in the thousands.   Like how tf did they get people to suddenly accept that anyone who criticizes Judaism is literally Hitler. Not only accept it, but push their propaganda for them too.  Shits wack.
Is it really a trend if he's been top of the charts for 15 years?
Meek mill*
??? I‚Äôm not a nazi or a ye fan anymore but Street Lights still makes me feel some type of way. it‚Äôs okay to have emotions bro  Also afaic Drake by default won all beefs bc yedolf, and I am NOT a Drake fan
Kim been having North hanging out with Ice Spice‚Ä¶ north is 9
Yep. No idea how ppl still buy into this idea that Kanye is somehow righteously protecting his kids from Kim, as if he isn‚Äôt clearly the worse parent of the 2 by far
Lol
Yikes
Agreed, they get way overhated. Like yeah you might think they‚Äôre annoying or whatever but they really don‚Äôt do anything that bad. They made a dumb TV show and were very successful at it, that‚Äôs it. The only genuinely bad thing I can think of is that they‚Äôre probably involved in some fucked up business practices, but it‚Äôs not like that‚Äôs the reason anyone hates them.
Obviously he has mental health problems, but I bet the Kardashian environment exacerbated his symptoms.
Nah her loss was fire. Agreed wrt NVMH and CLB though
As a rapper he‚Äôs doing the most atm if I‚Äôm not mistaken, eitehr way he‚Äôs been lazy with it and I wouldn‚Äôt consider myself a fan of his new music
 I asked chat gpt to write a few raps for me just joking around and got some really cool shit lol you just gotta ask it to rap like Drake, rap like will Smith or sound like snoop
Lol. It's almost always applied onto a raw recording. Only exception is live performances.
ok
I‚Äôll give u like 1/3rd bangers lol. Middle of the Ocean is my fave Drake track in a while though
oh you were a nerd, who didn't play outside. cool story bro
people don‚Äôt realize that the worst thing you can do to someone who has bipolar, is to make them famous and talented. Because paranoia is common with bipolar and kanye is famous so it only adds onto the paranoia. And Kanyes talented so it makes it harder to get him to take his meds cause then he loses his creativity and doesn‚Äôt feel like himself. And he love‚Äôs attention and will say the wildest shit for attention and he‚Äôs a celebrity so they give him attention when he talks.   It‚Äôs a perfect storm, if kanye was diagnosed before he got famous he might‚Äôve kept taking it but now he views his bipolar as a superpower and his medication as kryptonite. He thinks he got to where he is because of his bipolar but he doesn‚Äôt realize he also ruined his legacy because of his bipolar
>	If you actually encountered serious issues like this you‚Äôd understand to help you can‚Äôt just bash them and push them away, you need to realize it‚Äôs not their fault for the majority of what they do  I‚Äôve struggled with mental health and worked with mentally I‚Äôll people as well, and at some point it‚Äôs on you to deal with it. It‚Äôs not your *fault* but it‚Äôs your *problem*. You have to want to get better, Kanye clearly doesn‚Äôt, and being endlessly patient with him when he‚Äôs spouting literal Nazi rhetoric isn‚Äôt going to help. You can be mentally ill, and a terrible person, they‚Äôre not mutually exclusive. It‚Äôs not like he was a paragon of virtue before this   I am 100% capable of pushing a person like that away. Fuck Nazis
> you can‚Äôt just bash them and push them away  I think when you get to the point of repeatedly praising Hitler, I think the general public is definitely allowed to bash you and push you away. Kanye has tons of family and tons of financial resources to deal with whatever mental health issues he's dealing with. I don't think this requires the general public to like him or approve of anything he says.   We don't need to baby this guy, he became rich of making classic albums (pre-2016), and making overpriced shoes/clothing. He can afford to get help, his family can push him to get help. I don't think we need to avoid criticizing him.
He repeatedly said he loved hitler, he repeatedly said Nazis deserved to be praised. It is absurd you are trying to defend that. Ridiculous.
> There's a lot of things I *looooooooooove* about Hitler  \- Kanye West  Acting like someone has to personally be murdering people and wearing Nazi regalia to be considered a Nazi is some real disingenuous shit.
who is "they" and what "propaganda" are you referring to
> Drake by default won all beefs bc yedolf  Yeah man, people *totally* think he won the push beef because of.. yedolf?
Tbh I think Yedolf just strengthen why it‚Äôs just a sad, pointless beef in the first place. Like everyone who would ever stop fw Ye already has (look at my username, I‚Äôm one of them) and anyone that still does will always blindly support him. So this is really just the most popular rapper in the world sending shots at a washed up nazi no one cares about anymore.
L take
I see. The grammar was crazy
Ice Spice is a regular ass person and from the looks of interviews seems genuinely nice. Her music isn't age appropriate but she can't ever be around kids at all? Especially with their parents present? That's weird lol.
Are we just assuming Ice Spice is talking about backshots around kids or something? Is this where we start acting like none of us were listening to Parental Advisory sticker music as kids?
And?
ice spice can‚Äôt be around 9 year olds?
Why everyone acting like Kanye didn‚Äôt ask Kim to marry him üíÄ
Not taking meds exacerbated his problems lol
> I'm the king of the six, Drake's the name,  > I spit fire on the mic, it's not a game,  > Started from the bottom, now I'm on top,  > Got the whole world watching, can't ever stop.   > I've got a flow so smooth, it's like butter,  > And my rhymes hit hard, like no other,  > I've got a million-dollar smile, and it's all mine,  > And I'll keep getting richer, one rhyme at a time.    This is what it gave me when I said to write a verse like Drake lmfao
It can rap in their style to an extent but it still comes off as superficial to me, even with GPT4.
tell me you don‚Äôt record hip hop vocals without telling me   it‚Äôs literally the opposite in rap, it‚Äôs almost always used to record live
‚Äúcool story bro‚Äù bro stays using outdated termsüíÄ
Bipolar disorder also when unchecked destroys your brain and breaks it down, sure you still have swings of mania and swings of mellowing out, but as it goes on the mellowing out isn‚Äôt as stable anymore because it‚Äôs debilitating. So anyone saying he should just be smart enough to get help don‚Äôt realize that even when he‚Äôs not in a manic episode he will be feeling affects from it. It‚Äôs kindve a joke how people act, I‚Äôm not defending the statements he made but anyone can see the person he used to be compared to now and it‚Äôs obvious his life has been destroyed socially by mental health issues.
How the fuck am I defending his statements? I‚Äôm just saying he isn‚Äôt a full blown Nazi for his edgy ‚Äúlove everyone‚Äù statements. Anti-Semitic for sure. Nazi? Reaching.
Nazi - "a member of the¬†far-right¬†National Socialist German Workers' Party."
Don't act dumb
Bro get out of here. Dude obviously meant beefs with your favorite Nazi Ye. Push clearly goated ain‚Äôt nobody arguing that shit anymore.
people think he won it because the public dickrides drake beyond belief
That is a fair point. Drake has no need to beat a dead horse.
fr lmao it‚Äôs early morning for me i thought i was having a stroke
The grammar was non-existent lol
Getting paid to hang out with a 9 year you wouldn‚Äôt otherwise be around while she lip syncs to you rapping about back shots isn‚Äôt the same tho
She was dancing to a song of ice spice with lyrics about taking backshots.
Honestly funniest apart about millennials/gen-z is that they clutch their pearls maybe harder than any other generation. Just very very selectively and unpredictably
Ice spice is partly famous for rubbing her pussy in music videos man. If you don't see the problem w having your 9 year old daughter associated with that, than idk. That just sounds wild to me. Kids are VERY impressionable, and North isnt exactly surrounded by the women known for their class right now.
this sub acting like people weren‚Äôt listening to GRODT when they were a kid lmao   but somehow listening to ice spice is a crime
Many things can be true at the same time. The Kardashian environment definitely wasn't ideal for someone like Kanye and everybody with half a brain knew it. However, Ye is his own man and decided to marry Kim and have with her a bunch of children. Kim isn't a monster either, she helped Kanye and supported him for almost a decade through some of the wildest shit a celebrity could do. Idc what people say, she's a real one for all that. But enough's enough & she was completely justified in asking for that divorce. Calling her a gold digger for trying to protect her own brand & family, when she's rich as fuck already, is dumb. During the divorce she was a bitch, sure, but man, that's expected from a Kardashian. Ye should have known better, he wasn't crazy 10 years ago
Mf really thinks all meds from the pharma industry are there to heal youü§£ü§£
Lmfao well for what it's worth I'm working on a kids book and asked it to write me a educational rap sounding like will Smith and it knocked it out the park lol
outdated? why are you trying so hard to be cool. its cringe. grow up kid
Kanye: literally says he loves Hitler and the Nazis  Kanye stans: "uhh yeah antisemetic I guess, but Nazi? nahhh, reach."
Damn I guess no Nazis have existed since 1945 then.    Obviously we're talking about neonazis you buffoon.
you first, say it with your chest
Literally what part of my comment makes you think I support Kanye? I just pointed out that he said *all beefs* which would include the one he lost.. because he said *all* of them   Learn to read
I don‚Äôt disagree I just think the framing is off.  For generations we‚Äôve all listened to and consumed media that is legit no good for kids to be listening to.  The weird thing is that she paid for a weird playdate media thing‚Ä¶ like y‚Äôall couldn‚Äôt have privately attended a concert or something???  You‚Äôd rather just pimp out your daughter on social media like that?  Kinda weird for an adult to do‚Ä¶
Reminds me of how upset mom was after she overheard real slim shady playing at my friend's house when we were 10.  >your mom was right rap was bad for you   -hhh 2023
Its insane.   Every 9 year old, even to this fucking day knows Baby Got Back, but you won't see them crying about it.
by this logic ye should never see his kids again
Bro at the age of 9 I knew all the area codes that ludacris had hoes in, she‚Äôll be fine
Lmaooo are you serious? Do you think people like Nicki, Ice Spice, and Lil Kim shouldn‚Äôt be allowed around children or something? They‚Äôre normal ass people, and yes normal ass people show off their body.  By all accounts Ice Spice is a nice down to earth person, you out here acting like because she twerked in her video that automatically makes her a bad influence.
by that reasoning, kids should never listen to a lot rap
You're the weirdo here.
I was listening to Eminem's uncensored albums when I was 9, along with stuff like 2 live crew. I was watching music videos rife with women in thongs twerking.  I somehow didn't get damaged and grow up to be a serial killer or something.  Idk what the deal with the moral panic around kids and content is. Unless they're being directly victimized, everything is usually blown way out of proportion. Nobody gets their psyche shattered by hearing about sex in music or movies
Nah nah you don't get it  You can listen to music about murder and drugs as a male kid, but you can't listen to music about sex as a female kid
Yes, if you have a mental illness you need to take medicine or you will have a wide range of problems. Free thinking isn't just doing the opposite of what an authority says.
Y'all will literally believe some QAnon level conspiracy bullshit to avoid holding that man accountable.
Better not take anything and become a Nazi and lose custody of my kids then       fucking idiot
‚Äúgrow up kid ü§ì‚Äù
Those comments aren‚Äôt even the antsemetic part. Those comments were in a long tirade about how he loves everyone from some weird Christian perspective.   I love Hitler said as a joke, said as sarcasm, said as part of a ‚Äúeveryone is loved by god‚Äù rant, and said seriously as a neo-Nazi are all different shouldn‚Äôt be treated the same way.
Neonazi - "a member of an organization similar to the German Nazi Party."
U a clown buddy go back to work
I mean if Eminem was in the room with you hanging out yea. That‚Äôs be wierd
its one thing to know about it, its another thing to lipsync it to millions of people on tiktok. its clear she's being nudged in a certain direction by her guardians
All these dicks pearl clutching when they were watching and singing Tip Drill, Baby Got Back and all types of examples at the same ages
Bro, Nickis brother is a convicted pedophile. Horrible example.
You can‚Äôt just list those 3 clowns and say they are ‚Äúnormal ass people‚Äù   If someone doesn‚Äôt want their kids around an adult talking about rubbing her pussy then that‚Äôs fine by me.   Any child Kim raises is going to be exploited, like she was/is. I wouldn‚Äôt want my 9 year old anywhere near that
I mean they probably shouldn‚Äôt be hanging out regularly with children yeah, kids are so impressionable and would for sure look her up on their ipad, see pussy rubbing antics, and look up to that at the age of 9. I‚Äôd go out on a limb and say that that is a recipe for a man taking advantage of you at a young age.
I'm sure these women are cool people, but at the end of the day they're putting out sexually provocative content that's not child appropriate. To pimp your child out like that is immortal itself regardless of the company.
Kids are gonna listen to what they are gonna listen to. I just wouldn't want to encourage my 9 year old child to consume certain things at a young age - let alone- hang out with a celebrity known for creating adult content.
Literally said nothing close to what you are saying.
Never said anythign about that but ok.  Btw there is literally proof that his manager (who is also the manager of basically every famous person) messaged him saying:  ‚ÄûSecond option, I have you institutionalized again where they medicate the crap out of you, and you go back to Zombieland forever. Play date with the kids just won't be the same‚Äú  So i wouldn‚Äòt judge on anything the man says or does which looks crazy at least. The world they are living is surely completely different than ours lil bro
> I love Hitler said as a joke, said as sarcasm  Bro he literally repeated over and over that he loved hitler, loved Nazis, loved Hitler's fashion and how he was an architect, loved the Nazi's innovations, and said they made great contributions to society. He even threw in holocaust denialism. He repeatedly said he didn't like labeling Hitler/Nazi as evil.   even if you're saying "oh he loved everyone", you're referencing the specific quote which was "Every human being has brought something of value, especially Hitler". Why the fuck would you say especially Hitler?? It's just inexcusable.   You people are legitimately deranged.
Cool definition bro  > Neo-Nazism comprises the post‚ÄìWorld War II militant, social, and political movements that seek to revive and reinstate Nazi ideology.   You don't have to attend biweekly neonazi meetings to be a neonazi, you just have to share the same beliefs.   This is like saying I'm not a democrat because I'm a registered independent even though I exclusively vote democrat.
So every artist just gon be sittin in the middle of water huh
This may be an unpopular opinion, but as someone who used to like NF and felt he was getting boring and stale. This is something fresh from him and I really like a lot of this album.   The cordae track I could see blowing up.
scaring the hoes
White people eating
So far, his video singles have been A+ on the visuals but just not quite hitting for me personally musically. I was a little worried the album would be a little too light and upbeat with the title and direction of the singles.  Careful, Pandemonium, Suffice, Turn My Back, and Let Em Pray were some tracks that got my face scrunching. Tommee Profitt is such a versatile producer, so good with the beat builds and changes.  This album feels about the same balance as The Search album. A couple bangers for the gym. A couple of songs for the radio, one being double time. A couple emotional melancholic melodic raps.  There's always going to be some haters that say everything this dude does sounds the same, but this is yet another album now that's full of a lot of variety.
I dont like nf because of the whole spiritual lyrical myrical stuff.  That being said I'm going to go into this album with a completely open mind.... So.... Please don't disappoint
I, similar to many others don't really like NF and think he's just corny. I'm gonna be honest I only listened to one track because one of my cousins tweeted about it and is a fan (I would have literally never guessed she was).  The track was "happy" and honestly I didn't mind it at all. I'm gonna sound like a dick but I think the less he focuses on rap, the better his songs are.  This one strays away from his regular boom boom youtube esque rap shit most of us usually expect from him. I skimmed the rest and heard his usual stuff but I thought that track was nice.
I like it a lot on first listen
Finally got a chance to listen to it in full. Definitely a different feel compared to his previous albums. A bit more singing/pop/chiller stuff which is generally the style I prefer from him as some of my favorite tracks are Prideful, If You Want Love, and I Miss The Days. I am liking the most positive messages he delivers throughout the album. He has moved past some of his demons which were always highlighted in the previous albums and has moved onto forgiveness (which was mentioned multiple times), closure, and living a good life. This will resonate with fans like me who went through a hard time mentally and overcame it, but will probably turn away his fans who enjoy the darker side of his music.   Overall, I probably preferred The Search over this one because there were just more ‚Äúpowerful‚Äù tracks (Change, Only, I Miss The Days). But the change of tone will probably grow on me. I like that there was a bit of everything on this album although nothing really hit like some previous tracks. Hope was the typical big intro like every one of his albums. Motto was a bop that I liked more after a few listens. Careful was one of the better tracks with Cordae being a great feature. Pandemonium went hard. Mama was more of a ‚Äúfor himself‚Äù track.  HHH isn‚Äôt going to like this album but at least they can‚Äôt say ‚Äúit‚Äôs the exact same as every other project he drops‚Äù or ‚Äúit‚Äôs all just corny rap over cinematic beats with a big drop‚Äù
Don‚Äôt listen to this guy but the song with cordae goin on the gym playlist
This comment section is a dumpster fire, I love it.
I wanted to like this album, and some songs are cool but he kinda turned into imagine dragons/21 pilots on some songs which turned me off it immediately.
Happy is so good
the real Scaring the Hoes Vol 1
Mistake is nice. Running is cool. Ill leave the rest though.
Probably only going to be 4 tracks i will continue to listen to from the whole album. Aside from mama, not a lot of powerful songs like in previous albuns, instead just sounded very generic for the genre as whole, and that turn my back track was just awful tbh
Listening to NF should be on the same level as the electric chair
Takes a certain IQ level to enjoy NF
I dont even like NF but if he wasnt white half the hating comments would be on this albums nuts tonight.   Crazy the amount of racist ass comments when white rappers release music, just a double standard.  Anyways gave this a listen and its not bad, same old shit from this dude. Couple tracks i didnt mind.
god this is a painful listen
This album is definitely 95% singing, which is a huge change compared to his other projects. Also, I love his hype tracks but is it weird I got really bored during the second half of "TURN MY BACK"?   That being said I made the stank face a lot while listening to this project, so kudos to him
He got that typical YouTube rapper voice like this weird pop filter sound
Holy fuck this is ass üî•üî•
My man cordae just took a dive on the deep end of corniness. I mean he was always just a little, and could  be respected as an artist but now he just throwing it all away. I was hoping for a comeback after the lukewarm album.

Way too white, just screams white ü§¢
10/10 masterpiece for me. Haven't felt so emotionally affected by an album in a long time. Bullet is one of the best songs of the last decade.
NF > RAE SREMMURD > DRAKE  Nate wins tonight.
No this is definitely a change in sound for him. Very welcome indeed.
I am just so incredibly happy to hear him be happy.
I also used to really like NF, back in high school I jammed it a lot, and I still have lots of respect for him. But I gotta say I disagree, I feel this is easily his worst project. Therapy‚Äôs Sesssion had something special and on Perception he perfected that style. The Search was a good albums but I felt it was really just perception 2.0 and this is when I started to feel he was getting stale, and by the time the Clouds mixtape came I‚Äôd dropped off.  This albums definitely changes it up a lot, but his hype tracks are still that boring ‚ÄúI‚Äôm special cause I don‚Äôt care what people think, I make real music‚Äù stick. I‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs doing good, but this work rings a bit hollow for me.
‚ò†Ô∏èsettin us back fr

lmao sure, as long as others can post ‚Äúblack people eating‚Äù on an album about doing drugs and living off welfare since it‚Äôs apparently cool to be stereotypical and generally racist now
same could be said for almost any other album that gets posted on this sub lol
I‚Äôve learned that the people saying ‚Äúit all sounds the same‚Äù only listen to the intro tracks based on how they describe his music.
‚ÄúSongs that got my face scrunching‚Äù
Bro some of his fan base makes me cringe so fucking bad. If you want a good laugh, go on iTunes, look up NF epiphany. Some of these Christian listeners freak out because he‚Äôs in a song where Future curses. It‚Äôs so god damn cringe.
Conclusion?
So what'd you think?
It's weird cause he's a great lyricist and has great flow and everything required to be a good boom bap type rapper but all his rap sounds so damn similar that it's hard to listen to more than once, but his singing and slower stuff has way more replay value and remains solid with the lyrics and storytelling  I know it's a common comparison but I'm the same way with Eminem where I always listen to his songs when they release and appreciate the lyricism for what it is and all that but the music just doesn't have replay value to me (not comparing them beyond both have good lyricism and structure in different ways but lack replay value)
I can kinda get that. He has a good singing voice and can write well, though as far as spitting bars go, I‚Äôd be worried if he went head to head with other rappers. Though I do think Careful is pretty fire. I‚Äôd want to see more songs like that.
It's definitely more than just happy that isn't his typical boom boom stuff. Hardly any of the album is cinematic beats and theres like 4 singing only songs.
Sit on my roof like j Cole ü•∫
>he kinda turned into imagine dragons/21 pilots on some songs   He's always sounded like 21 pilots to me
I said it on a different NF post a few weeks ago but he is the imagine dragons of hip hop
Happy and mama are üî•üî•üî•
nf is great. Mama had me crying.
Not really
Takes a certain IQ level to enjoy most popular hip hop music today
<90
bro there‚Äôs plenty of black rappers that get clowned the exact same way (Hopsin, Dax, Joyner etc). i promise u no one would be on this corny ass albums nuts if it was by a black person
It‚Äôs really not that bad - most of this sub is deterministic about how an album is going to sound instead of actually giving it a fair chance. Sorta sad really but is what it is
"Closed mind is the mind of an idiot. Don‚Äôt believe that‚Äôs true, well open it"  Edit: dang y‚Äôall are WILLINGLY closed minded

stank face to NF üò≠üò≠üò≠
I wrote him off after the em feature
Well that's a very judgemental comment and racist.
[removed]
Bro?
bro i've sipped the NF koolaid when i was younger, but this is not a 10/10. Its got skips and some mid to low level hooks.      Carful, Suffice, MaMa was good. But this is not gonna be a album dipped in gold and show cased in a museum
i agree. when people say illmatic and tpab are great hip hop albums, i **HOPE** they talk about this album too.
NF is one of my favorite artists, and even I know that's fundamentally wrong.
Hell nah rae sremmurd album had some fire, and the drake song is a vibe. Nf corny as hell imo
Drake > Rae >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> NF
Is it really a change in sound? I don't hear it   NF has exactly three songs:  1. Rapping over cinematic beat 2. Mix of singing and rapping over drum track 3. Exclusively singing over piano, guitar, and/or violin   This applies to every single album he's made, and this album is no exception. If I were to categorize each song on this album:  1. Hope, Motto, Careful, Pandemonium, Suffice, Turn My Back, Turn My Back 2. Mama, Bullet 3. Happy, Gone, Mistake, Running   Listen to Mama, Prideful, Like This, 10ft Down, and I Just Wanna Know. Each of those songs is on a different album but they are musically *exactly the same*, the only differences are speed/pacing. There is no change in sound, just cope from people who desperately want him to be relevant.
The problems you're listing have existed since before Mansion. You're just older now so you've matured enough to see them. He hasn't changed his style once, I've always disliked him and this album is no change. Maybe even worse.
All some variation of calling me racist lmao

As you‚Äôre racist
That's true. Everytime he preps a new album/mixtape, he tends to start with a cinematic intro, and for some reason the people that hate him the most only pay attention to those intro songs.
Someone already said stank face here, I had to say something different.
I've never heard that before but I love it lol.
It killed him
Yeah man no kidding, few years ago I got hit by an 18 wheeler and slipped into a coma. Doctors said that was it, I‚Äôm never waking up, they tried everything man, one day accidentally someone played NF on their phone so I miraculously woke up to turn that shit off! NF SAVED MY LIFE üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•
Not serious
Its kinda weird to me hopsin and joyner get clowned and rappers like young thug, nba youngboy and lil uzi vert dont....shits garbage
Put this exact album on another rapper and it absolutely gets a good reception.
Corny as hell
weak ass bar lmao  criticizing something isnt close minded, not giving something an oppurtunity is, doesnt mean everything has to be good and you should just ignore shit thats whack
You hear this at a motivational speech seminar? What a lame ass response to an album dropping
That was BAR.
Ok fine, I made the face during *segments* of the album lol
I‚Äôd kms if I even accidentally made a stank face listening to NF of all people HAHAHAHAHAH
it‚Äôs so obvious you didn‚Äôt listen to the album.
To be fair em had 3 good albums before taking an absolute 90 degree nosedive into trash. Cordae had one, which is a shame.
[removed]
Not my favorite album of his, but what would you define as corny? Mansion, (the track) still makes me cry to this day because it hits home.
Hey, you know what they say, if it ain‚Äôt broke‚Ä¶that‚Äôs the motto
Additional point; I don‚Äôt understand why people complain about rappers that stick to what they excel at, it‚Äôs like yeah, no shit. That‚Äôd be like people questioning Lebrons greatness because he hasn‚Äôt played any other sport professionally.
Careful is definitely NOT a cinematic beat lol. It‚Äôs a Tech N9ne sample
Yes, but I think to some extent it was backed up before. The ‚Äòreal music‚Äô shtick was always cringey, but at least to me, his work was good enough I didn‚Äôt mind. It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôve matured, I still think Therapy Session through The Search are great, even though they don‚Äôt have much to offer me anymore.
Doesn't matter if you are racist or not. You posted something that is racist by definition.   Being called racist for posting racist comments should be expected. Why are you acting surprised by it?   You posted on the Livestreamfail subreddit more recently than me and you try to insult me with "live streams fail user".  You're not very smart I suspect. I would love to see how you would explain what I said in reply to your post is "false equivalencies about race". Would be hilarious to see how you manage that ü§£ü§£  Here is another: You actively use white as an insult on reddit. Surely you'd be fine with people using black/(or any other color) as an insult, right? It follows your logic but emotionally you wouldn't be able to handle it. That is the issue. It does indeed work both ways.
[removed]
[removed]
He is exaggerating the point to get you to understand how you're post is also racist.   If you can't understand his point, you're beyond ignorant. Seek an education.
Lmao thanks for the laugh
What NF does to a man
go back to facebook üòí
Bro I don‚Äôt like NF, but for someone who seems not to like him you sure are riding his dick in this thread like crazy
cause thug yb and uzi make good music
Uzi vert is a clown, that‚Äôs no surprise. Like‚Ä¶ isn‚Äôt he the one with a diamond in his head??? Like what the fuck is that.
Your ears need to be studied in a lab lol you have absolutely trash taste
People look at someone's past work and just assume it's the same shit. Album seems a lot more lighthearted.
Cap
The problem is most of these comments are doing exactly that, not giving something the opportunity. It‚Äôs pretty much ‚Äúlet me criticize this thing without knowing what it is I‚Äôm criticizing‚Äù
Dang, someone‚Äôs closed minded
Bruh it‚Äôs literally a lyric from the album LMAO
Did you even listen to the damn project, y‚Äôall are so desperate to shit on everything
the cordae track is pretty good so far. NF can make music that sounds good, it's just a matter of if he'll be a dork or not
i listened to the whole thing and a huge portion of it was corny he is constantly vaguely inspirational and using this inspirational voice to talk about nothing.  he still hasnt left the post 2010 eminem/early logic/joyner/hopsin/cordae lately/ the worst j cole fans area of corny  i wish him the best but he desperately needs to escape this area the way logic has kinda done  you cried to mama thats crazy to me ngl
1.7GPA take
But it is broke lol having all his songs be the same just means they're all equally bad
It he excelled at it then I wouldn't mind. I'd just chalk it up as his schtick and leave it there.  But he doesn't excel at it. He has chained himself to a repetitive pattern that doesn't work.
15 year old
Doesn‚Äôt matter if you are cringe or not. You posted something that is cringe by definition.
You're the "real music" fan here
[removed]
IF you don't understand the difference youre dumb. Why are you so mad
Not familiar
I cant tell if he‚Äôs serious or it‚Äôs a joke
He's making fun of the idiots that listen to this shit
Bro, ain‚Äôt no way you just said YB makes good music.
Sure lol
Yes as a hip hop fan of 20 years i have trash taste cause i don't enjoy music by a fruitcake who wears a dress or nba youngboy who you cant understand a word he says
 How do you know they aren't giving it the oppurtunity?
Sure pal, enjoy the Ponzi schemes you‚Äôre clearly going to fall for in life.
[removed]
what? majority of the album is a mix of singing and raps, more singing iirc. also im so confused by that list‚Ä¶ ‚Äúearly logic‚Äù sounds nothing like this ü§£ i can‚Äôt actually pinpoint what you‚Äôre getting at with that lmao  If you listened to How Could You Leave Us and then Mama, it gets me in my feels.
Couldn‚Äôt disagree more, this album is a really nice pay off and ties a lot of loose ends that he struggled with on previous albums. It‚Äôs nice to hear him sound happier now, and his sound is definitely different than his previous projects
Why are you still here? Lol.. don‚Äôt you have some MGK you should be listening to?
Ah, so you just aren‚Äôt a fan of him. That‚Äôs fine. But why‚Äôs he got you all up in a tizzy man?
Well guess it's working perfectly fine for him! His Hope Tour show in Amsterdam was sold out in 10 minutes today, and he never had so many followers/fans as he has atm.
You just sound kinda mad that you don‚Äôt like NF in the first place tbh. Lots of artists have topics they tend to stick to/beats they‚Äôre more drawn to than others. That‚Äôs not anything new.
Doesn‚Äôt work for you. It seems to be working for him just fine.
Anyone who responds with ‚Äúyou try to insult me‚Äù is actually really hurt.
Whatever you say!   Keep spreading hate and insults because of someone's skin color! You're really good at it I see.
Define cringe and let me know how it applies.   Dude I am replying to is an actual moron. It is hilarious
[removed]
Just let people enjoy things man lol
Ok, we get it, you don't like NF. That's fine, but no need to start hurling insults at people who do. I don't like country music that much, but several people I know do and love it. That doesn't make them idiots.   Live and let live man goodness...
But why make fun of people for their music preference. Like sorry we don‚Äôt like listening to the same ol, guns, drugs, and hoes type rap. I much prefer something with substance. And especially with NF, seeing him progress as a person from album to album man, it‚Äôs cool to see. But keep sitting on Reddit, hating on a dude that‚Äôs selling out arenas.  Let em pray
it‚Äôs a parade inside my city yeah
Typical Eminem fan
Go listen to your white lyrical spiritual bullshit old man homophobe
I mean for starters I got downvoted for commenting a lyric that applied to the conversation. I feel like if people listened to the album they would‚Äôve actually known what specific song it was from, but clearly they didn‚Äôt lol
You‚Äôre being asked to step out of your comfort zone and try something new, and your first response is to get upset? How does that make you sound??
[removed]
its not the sound, its the corniness, its the vague bragging with no real end goal, and a real detachment from a lot of hiphop culture.   I was christian when i was younger so I did listen to how could you leave us and mama, and they dont do it for me.
im glad hes happier, hope he can be happier over better music tho
MGK is ass
This argument is so cringe as most NF fans would be the first people to bash 'mumble' rappers who have the exact same level of success, yet because NF is real music its different..
Why drop the context? He tried to make fun of me for posting on a certain subreddit, yet he posted on the same subreddit more recently than me.  No logic to be found lmao
Mad
[removed]
>hating on a dude that‚Äôs selling out arenas  Is he though lmao as far as I'm aware he hasn't toured in a while
I don‚Äôt know what you just said to me
Figured someone would go there next so typical, i love so much hip hop and thats where it goes. Cool sorry i don't like your dogshit rappers gen z likes
Lol its funny that you went with the "white" lyrical mkracle spirtual rapper when that ones not even my fav rapper of all time.  Nas is probably my favorite of all time, do you have a problem with him aswell?  Figured you only had an issue with the WHITE ones not surprised
Yeah i see what you're saying, but that lyric is saying nothing and isn't very clever, at least in my opinion.   I skimmed through the album last night and found it boring. I think we can just agree to disagree about whats good and not good because you are a fan on NF
What the fuck kind of drugs are you on? Whatever they are, stop.
[removed]
üö©üö©
What would the difference between better music and this album be for you ? What sort of subjects or style would he have to change ? Or do the goalposts move no matter what he does ?
A rare comment worth upvoting from you üòÇ
Because literally everyone insults everyone on Reddit. It‚Äôs like a shitposting cestpool with a topic everything. There‚Äôs no logic or respect to be found on here.
"Ha, you're white, you get no opinion on hip hop! I am black, my opinion matters way more!!"  That is what you sound like to grown adults. Really cringe.
He just announced his tour, and all the shows are already like 80% filled and tickets have only been on sale to the general public for 5 hours
We get it grandpa
You didn‚Äôt answer the question
the NF oppression is real üò™  ive never moved goalposts i just still think hes not good  he needs to get off his ‚Äúi could be this and that but i dont want to cos im so different‚Äù that ‚Äúmotto‚Äù is leaking with imo, he and cordae both suffer from the issue of talking about their talent and ability much more than they do actually show it, and is always complaining of ‚Äúoh the haters dont like me (on let em pray especially lol) cos im different‚Äù as if unique and different rappers arent always getting love from the hiphop community   his voice also lacks real personality and finesse on the mic, some the flows he tries are good and he does get personal but he uses this real motivational speaker type voice which seems to trick people into thinking the track goes hard imo, but it just comes across as him trying so *harddd* that its corny tbh, even his ‚Äúcool guy voice‚Äù still has an undertone of trying to be something hes not, idk it just doesnt seem totally authentic.  he also needs to find a totally different producer, i think a lot of christian rappers like lecrae, andy mineo, etc are hanging around the same guys the similarities are wayyyy to strong between some of their stuff. I know hes tried different stuff but i really think he needs a shift in a total diff direction, out of the grand church rap and the strings his clouds mixtapes has, and try something not within his comfort zone.  i think if someone just have him better beats, ESPECIALLY better drum patterns and melodies, he could create a unique sound, but rn he still sounds like hes rapping over uplifting hillsong music sometimes.  some of this is singy pop rap and thats fine, if thats what he wants to do its cool and he seems to hit the mark with that.  but hes listing dre, drake, cole, kenny, cordae, sean, 6lack, and doesnt seem to want any of the interesting parts of their style at all, which he says is ‚Äúhis taste‚Äù.  idk if that all makes sense but ye
Ye. But the hypocrisy is hilarious. He's just being blatantly shameless.
Never said I was black. Also hip hop is black culture
Im glad im a "grandpa" i atleast grew up in an era where the rappers were talented
The point still goes over your head. Hip hop is far beyond one person's culture. You're essentially saying any type of music one culture created, is not allowed to be used by another group's culture.   Do you understand how ignorant that is? Almost everyone who does hip hop is inspired by black artists and they do their own thing and most pay homage. Why do you feel the need to gatekeep a music genre?
Can you try not to be such a stereotypical Eminem fan I mean cmon, at least surprise us a little bit
Joey love songs are undefeated
Bro in his R&B bag my goodness this is smooth
Ohhhh I‚Äôm liking this one
This is so refreshing. Like, music doesn‚Äôt sound like this anymore. Even the R&B I‚Äôve listened to. This just sounds nostalgic.
I feeling this track a lot holy shit. Buttery ass beat and I feel like this may be one of his better singing songs.
 Beautiful track
Joey entering his new prime
Smooth track from Joey, could‚Äôve been him singing for the entire song but I still liked his verse anywayüî•
It‚Äôs going to be a hit , it‚Äôs a real R&B song it has a nice hook, the instrumental is real smooth and jazzy and Joey delivered with his vocals . I feel like this song is going to do well for what it is and that‚Äôs Mainstream. Joey been wanting to broaden his fan base and do other things with his artistry and I think this is the song that‚Äôs going to check those boxes . (yes it‚Äôs nothing too crazy, but it‚Äôs a good introduction to the new R&Bada$$ era)
Daaaamn that was smooth
Incredibly smooth. Great track
Yeah..this is fucking great lol
Woah
this is so good, hardly needed a rap verse, not complaining though

damn this is nice
Going from Daniel Caesar's album to this song is crazy. Joey sounds just like Caesar on this (other than the rapping)
This is 5 times better than the new Drake track and got like a 5th of the upvotes. Makes sense
I like it sonically but he is not a good singer
This shit sounds gorgeous. Even though I always liked this style from Joey to see it done like this. Wow. Need more of this
Right like idk if I‚Äôm crazy but it really reminds me of  Waterfalls by TLC and I feel like that‚Äôs why he called it Fallin
Too much "modern" R&B to me is either 1) mediocre at best but uses a Rhodes piano which is just a dope sound that carries the song on its shoulders or 2) what I call "weed comedown" music. Which I haven't related to since I was a burnt out 20 year old. That hazy, lazy, semi depressed but sexual vibe.
No shit man, Drake is literally one of the biggest popstars in the world, wtf do you expect??
I really only like SiR, Anderson, and Kyle Dion. Other than them you are %100 right.
Oh shit bro, thanks for explaining this to me! I had no idea, but luckily nothing gets by you!
Just brilliant, can‚Äôt wait for the album.
fire. kaytranada and amine a perfect combo
Kaytranada can not miss
Smooth as hell  Edit: Amine has been one of my favorites for a few years so I'm so excited for this record.
Damn I was wondering what the summer album was gonna be this year, easy pick once this drops by the looks of it
Yeah this is a duo that should‚Äôve happened already by now, I‚Äôm hyped for the project
Such a great track. Sad that its not Summer for me anymore so I cant experience this song fully for another like 8 months lol
this is gonna be so fucking good wow this year is nuts for music
This sounds more natural than the IDK collab.
It's a slapper, thank god for Kaytranada
Holy fuck this album is gonna cook.   Amine is super dope, I‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs carved out his lane and is sticking around.
I can already tell this tape is gonna be perfect for summer nights
solid birthday present
The Calling Brio stuff was great so I'm so happy they linked back up
Kaytranada production is always insane, he just can't miss
Summer banger
Kaytranada is not from this planet man he has a higher understanding of music lmao
Thank god for some good music tonight smooth af
I‚Äôve been a huge Pharrell kick lately and this was completely unexpected but I love it. If this project is anything like Simple by Kaytranada x IDK it‚Äôll be on repeat this Summer.
this is such a perfect intersection between all 3 artists. it sounds like all of them, no sacrifices
This album is about to go stupid
Fireeee
Great track. "Hit it with some rhythm, call it pussy percussion" is a strong contender for lyric of the year imo.
Kaytranada was my intro to Amine back on SoundCloud I‚Äôm so hyped for this album
Kaytranada has essentially been the making the same beat for like 10 years, and it never gets old. And nobody else can get the bounce he gets, instantly recognizable
Love the Nash and Booker barüî•

Summer album of the year for sure
Nobody works harder on they're production than electronic producers
Sounds like Zulu Screams by GoldLink.
This is just ok to me.  Maybe i just don‚Äôt find Amin√© interesting.
Amine is just amazing - the Je M‚Äôappelle flow was great. One of the nicest rappers on mic atm.  Can‚Äôt wait I have high hopes about this shit.
Humongous Amine fan and I find this to be just mid. It's fine but not making me extremely hype for the project. Little too chill for my liking
Only here for Kaytranada and Pharrell    I'm never really been an Amin√© fan but gonna listen to this album when it drops!
Was hyped when two of my favorite artists announced a collab album and if the rest of it sounds like this, I'm hyped.
This shit mean something to me man
Windows down all summer with this track
Exactly as fire as i expected. Cant wait for the whole album.
Always glad to hear more Amin√©!
Never would‚Äôve expected these two to get together, but this is perfect!
Fire
As someone that was bumping Calling Brio back in 2017, in anticipation to Good For You, hearing fresh Amin√© on Kaytranada beat immediately hits the right spot and evokes some memories I had from that time. High expectations from this one.
So vibey, sheesh
The synth towards the end of the track is nice asf
Album of the summer and its not even out nor summer yet
God damn
Might be because I really love them both but this is so fucking good, one of the best singles of the year for me so far
This is good as fuck ! Hyped for the album
For real, I was hooked as soon as the voice chops came in. Really hope Amin√© also brings back some of TWOPOINTFIVE's high energy, enjoyed it so much at the time
Has an album been announced? I wasn't sure if this was it
it's his curse
His staying power has blown my mind. I was so wrong about him. I figured he would be a "Fetty Wap type" who drops the best single of a year and kinda dissappear after a while... Very glad I was wrong.
They‚Äôve already put out several songs together, they‚Äôre on SoundCloud
The Northern Hemisphere will ride for you homie
23 looking more and more like 15-16 honestly
What else coming this year? I'm feel like it's been pretty underwhelming so far
I actually thought the full IDK project was a very consistent vibe, but I really love this too. Excited to see which project ends up in my rotation more, Kaytra too good
IDK is just kinda mid. Amine ain‚Äôt
The IDK collab was fine but I get the sense Kaytranada wasn‚Äôt hugely involved or invested, he didn‚Äôt really promote it and it sounded like IDK was just rapping over throwaway Kaytra beats. Looks like the opposite is the case here, this single is fantastic
They shouldn‚Äôt have made a full album together. Two-three song EP and then go their separate ways.
Ratchet Happy Birthday to you
[have I got a treat for you](https://open.spotify.com/track/2iPcFRoOAQUnAWT6t3UfbV?si=ba303528f3d94721)
Man you must not have listened to much Kaytranada if you think he‚Äôs been making the same beat.  He‚Äôs all over the place
That shit was heat in the snippet too
I see people say this all the time but Limbo was really solid. Tapered off in the second half but a damn good album
yeah they‚Äôre dropping an album and this is the first single
yeah, May 12th
He's got the midas touch fr
It didn't get as many plays as I was expecting, but Limbo was an insanely good album. So cohesive and fun front to back
his twopointfive album went largely unnoticed
Northern hemisphere take my energy
this is said literally every year lmfao
As of right now 22 was better
I had such high hopes for his work after listening to IWASVERYBAD for the first time and ended up so unbelievably disappointed by his output moving forward. Idk what it is with unique artists folding under the mainstream pressure and conforming with their peers in recent years, but I feel like I've noticed that shit happening a lot. I would have killed to see *Jay* IDK build off of the sound of that album instead of going the trap route and giving us generally mediocre music with nowhere close to the amount of substance he originally had.
They forsure the same level
IDKs best work> Amines best work.  Amine has had more enjoyable projects overall tho.  Thought this track was mid and the idk kaytra project was mid too.
IDK isn‚Äôt just kinda mid he is ASS
seen him live twice. mid both times
>two artists should've done what I wanted !!
It was literally 8 songs, shit was fire too
thanks boss
I‚Äôm familiar with it! I thought Pharrell‚Äôs falsetto was kinda awkward on there, I prefer this cause Pharrell coproduced it and it‚Äôs just a hook.
For sure, you prob misunderstood me (or I did?) I wasn't opposing them. Limbo is definitely a great great album I agree
Good for you is a personal classic. I‚Äôve loved pretty much all of his releases, it‚Äôs wild to me he‚Äôs as low key as he is, popularity wise
Last year was my favorite year of the last decade, just barely ahead of 2016.  If 23 tops 22 I'll be so happy.
That‚Äôs interesting, I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs conformed at all. Yeah, he has a the occasional ‚Äútrap route‚Äù song but Is He Real? Is an incredible album with great beats and a really great concept and subject matter. ‚ÄúNo Cable‚Äù alone should be enough to see he hasnt gone the ‚Äútrap route‚Äù, its a fantastic song. He‚Äôs been consistently working on his craft, you can tell that he especially worked on his singing. All his albums are carefully planned and executed and its reflected in the music. I think is he real is his best album but usee4yourself was really good too and ofc IWASVERYBAD was fantastic. He‚Äôs been consistently showing growth and putting out great sounding and meaningful conceptual bodies of work, I don‚Äôt get why he‚Äôs being dismissed like this in this sub lol. Maybe give Is he real? another chance
The disappointing run after IWASVERYBAD reminds me so much of YG after My Brazy Life.   Dudes are both doing fine so hey if they're making what they want to make good for them, sure isn't what I was hoping for though
Amine has been pretty consistent for me I‚Äôve liked pretty much all his albums albums. Can‚Äôt really say the same about IDK tbh
Hell no, Amine at least has an interesting voice and can make catchy songs, do different sounds. I like IDK but he just feels derivative
You're completely right (and IDK has two projects better than Amines best album) but this sub has a weird hateboner for IDK so you're gonna get dogpiled
What is idk‚Äôs best work? Is it still IWASVERYBAD? Cause I love that project and have been lukewarm on everything he‚Äôs dropped since
Garbage opinion
And 2 were skits lmfao, so literally the 6 full songs that this dude said
[the instrumental by itself](https://open.spotify.com/track/3HK5yZpwoEEGVIaP1beZaJ?si=c11fa1f2e6654631) is also fucking great
he's probably more well known that it seems, but I feel the same way. underappreciated but one of the most talented rappers out right now
He absolutely does not lmao. Also Valid criticism =\ hateboner
IDK got more personal (and rapped, and sang better) on his last *solo album than Amine has to date - and I'm an Amine fan.  I swear IDK could win a pulitzer and this sub would still dogpile him and call him derivative.
Yup, that‚Äôs exactly how I feel
Ok IDK don‚Äôt know one person on this planet beside ur mom that listens to you
I think he meant two to three, but still it‚Äôs a super short listen
That's how I feel about JID. For my money he's the most talented in the game rn outside maybe Kendrick or Tyler. So many people I talk music with have never heard of him still which is so strange to me.
i do
please don‚Äôt be trash I need something to play at laser tag this summer
Wait am I tripping or was there like 0 marketing for this?? I‚Äôve been waiting for their 4th album for a long time and I had no idea this was dropping.
Man why tf is lean gone cold not the studio version smh
Man, I really miss the 2014-2016 run of MIKE WILL MADE IT beats with these guys. Something just feels so off and ‚Äúquiet‚Äù about this. Maybe they‚Äôve outgrown their style or the world has just changed and they had too long a gap to keep relevant.
Why couldn't Swae record a studio version of Leans Gone Cold?? Would've gone so hard
Never forget lic like bic is one of the best intros ever
All I‚Äôm hoping for is a decent album here - never will be the hype of 1, but just want a couple bangers
I missed these two. So happy to have some new music from them. Wish I could relive 2014-2016, what a time to be alive. So far, this album does seem to recapture some of that magic.
This is pretty good. Not perfect but there are some nice songs on this
This intro beat crazy...Mike Will we missed you damn
Flaunt It/Cheap is crazy lol. Few other good songs as well. Album is better than I thought it‚Äôd be
No fucking way they used the tiktok audio of Swae singing Leans Gone Cold instead of him making a studio version....  Edit: Origami MIGHT BE A RETURN TO FORM...a Kevin Samuels bar???  They are 2/2 with Royal Flush omg....
Flaunt It/Cheap is on a whole other level
So nice to be listening to some fresh Rae Sremmurd. Been too fucking long man.
This album ain't bad at all
Aye man I‚Äôm barely halfway but there‚Äôs  already a few bangers on this shit, I‚Äôm glad they got back to this, they made perfect party/club music that makes you just wanna go up. Mississippi, Bend Ya knees, Origami.
Bout half way though and this is pretty good imo
This album is absolute fire so farüî•
Mississippi Slide goes hard
Swae Lee brought that heat on ‚ÄòMississippi Slide‚Äô. Great flow
Jumping straight to Leans gone cold
Made me feel 18 again. I liked this a lot.
adhd anthem is one of them ONES holy
Free young thug
Fetty and sremm really said ‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è
Do people actually drink their lean warm or am I missing something
‚ÄòYMCA‚Äô is a bop. One of my favorites so far.
pump that grew on me
I actually really enjoyed this. The production was ridiculous
\[LEAK\] Next Rae Sremmurd album to be called 5remm Life
Not so bad sounding like they recorded this shit through a walkie talkie wtf
Slim Jimmy dropping AntiVax bars is hilarious üòÇüòÇ  ‚ÄúMy diamonds vaccinated than a hoe, that mean they even colder than before‚Äù   Don‚Äôt get me wrong that song still super fye üî•
Jxmmi completely outshone Swae on this, Swae sounds flat the majority of the time while Jxmmi brings so much energy.  I love in Royal Flush when his WOOOO ad-lib is so loud it clips the mic üò≠
wish they experimented more like on flaunt it/cheap, that shits amazing
I think the music is good, BUT it lacks the energy of the OG music they were making. If you think about Rae Sremmurd's best music, this is like a 6-6.5/10 relative to that.
Leans Gone Cold just makes me wish Don Toliver put the leaked song with Kid Cudi on his album lol
Adding it to a playlist with Community Dick so I can get the full listening experience god intended üôè
flaunt it is a brockhampton song wtf
These niggas Spazzing
As someone who has never heard not so bad (lean gone cold) till tonight. Man I stood up like that dj kahlid gif even off the recording i was like, THIS IS GAS lol
Good start
I couldn‚Äôt be more pleased with this album, the song with future on SR3MM washes the one on here but aside from that I‚Äôm so happy they finally dropped and delivered so hard
YMCA is solid
Wish Frequency was on it

Mike will in his bag
They came serious. Royal Flush üî•
 This album was everywhere sound wise. I heard some Hyperpop, Miami Bounce, Typical Trap, Louisiana bounce, Idk what happened on flaunt it/Cheap and sexy  But  YMCA, torpedo,Activate & Mississippi Slide was fire though  It also felt great to hear songs with Swae on the hooks
Honestly really like this album so far. Then again I love a lot of music from 2014-2016 and that‚Äôs what the beats remind me of.
Wild everyone seems disappointed by this imo this is their best album overall. The others definitely have higher highs but for me we‚Äôre full of skips the only one I don‚Äôt care for on this is the outro
Album is flames so far. Great to see Rae giving credit to Em after the Swae Lee shoutout in Music to be Murdered By
Free Thug
They shoulda mixed leans gone cold like how someone mixed his sunflower spiderman song with post malone ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Leans gone cold I‚Äôm wondering why üî•üî•üî•
Origami is a really good intro
Origami is üî•üî•
Sexy got me twerking like a hoe
SEXY is a certified banger from the late 80s
they never miss on the intros
Fire
A few tracks in and I'm a little conflicted. I feel like this is actually a really well made album, the beats, mixing and rapping is really tight.            But I feel like this doesn't really sound like Rae Sremmurd. Theres no hype/energy and crazy party songs. But on the other side this isnt really a new chapter/grown up.       Its just, like so much other trap today, so skeletal and low energy.
This doesn‚Äôt hit like it did back in 2015. Just seems like their sound hasn‚Äôt aged well. Or maybe I‚Äôm just getting old.
SR3MM was hella mid looking back but swae lee‚Äôs solo had some bops   i still think Guatemala is their best song
I am pleasantly surprised
Mid - plain not good & I blame the production. Doesn‚Äôt match the 1st two projects for sure.
I hope this album doesn't get slept on
First 3 songs were fire then this shit fell off NGL, Activate and Torpedo were decent too but o stall this just didn‚Äôt have the energy I was hoping for. What happened? Their first 2 albums were so damn good and the actual Rae Sremmurd songs on SR3MM were pretty decent. This just made me wish for 2016.
Wow this is underwhelming
Why y'all not talking abt activate shit is tuff
So, I listened to this earlier today because this album actually came out in NZ and Australia. Usually you don‚Äôt see a lot of rap albums get uploaded like that because a lot of them get submitted really late in the process.  I‚Äôm gonna be totally honest. I hated this album. I love Rae Sremmurd‚Äôs first 2 albums. I felt like Sr3mm had some good moments but was the beginning of a decline for them. The only song I really liked was YMCA and Young Thug‚Äôs feature on Royal Flush. Otherwise I felt like this album was a step back in every way for them. I wish Slim was used to rap more. I put it on my spreadsheet as my least favorite album I have heard this year. I scored it a 2 out of 10. This felt devoid of the charm that their earlier work had. It doesn‚Äôt feel like they have matured to where they need to be yet. It‚Äôs like they are trying to pull the same tricks from when they first started. But back then they were really young. But Swae is 29 and Slim is 31. And it still feels like they are trying to act 18/19 years old.   Also, the wagyu in Paris line lol.   I hope they bounce back for me. I have always seen their potential as this dynamic pop/hip-hop/rap monster that could dominate music. And they have.
This shit ass but ‚Äúsomething I‚Äôm not‚Äù is good
Idk how yall are liking this, the production is not even close to the level of sremmlife and sr3mm, the features are mid and the flows are so repetitive from their older songs
How do you say Rae Sremmurd
sexy is fucking unlistenable
KEY! - Spend One Night > Rae Sremmurd - Sexy  Key does such a better job complimenting this beat. No knock on swae or jimmy I still gotta finish the album n give it a couple more listens but heard the beat on Sexy n immediately recognized it was the same as this key song I really like
Most of this sounds really dated.  Bummer
ADHD Anthem is a banger
There is like a couple good songs here, but i will not listen to this album again. The intro track Origami is probably the worst beat I've heard all year, i don't know if Mike Will has kids but this sounds like he copy pasted a beat on top of a child's first FL Studio project. The fact that this is the first thing you hear when starting this album is bonkers.   Then there tracks that are just mixed bad, the highlights like the features from thug and future are just too short.   Also in the closer, ADHD, there's a bar that is talking about there being too many clones (or something like that, I'm going off of memory from this morning), meanwhile both the beat and delivery sound like a Carti+Pierre ripoff..
Pretty mid tbh but I guess I saw it coming from the two singles they dropped off this album. Some of the instrumentals are nice but the songs as a whole are lacking the charm and energy I expect out of Rae Sremm and I know we were never listening for the lyrics but this has to be the worst they‚Äôve ever been, at least for Swae, he literally didn‚Äôt try at all‚Ä¶ I like thug verse on Royal Flush, YMCA, and Something I‚Äôm Not though.
Yeah these guys are done.  the reason they were popular is because their repetetive bars like aint got no type  , lit like bic, etc
- Royal Flush is the only good track. Everything else of this album is trash - I didn't have high hopes for this album and I was right. The album sounds like left over tracks they randomly put together. 1/10
‚ÄòToo many emotions‚Äô is a great closer to the album. Very happy with the whole album
https://open.spotify.com/album/4tFqnaGkCBUjraLUw07Q67?si=gODD5qGIS6W6r64DDssNsg
The top tracks for me are  Origami  Mississippi Slide  YMCA  Torpedo
something im not is craaaazyy, swae slides on that shit
Mid
They should‚Äôve had a woman rapper on Flaunt it.
Really loving activate all 3 went in
Not so bad reminds me so much of the sun goes down my zoot comes up
Mike will really leaned into the early 90s stock casio sounds
I'm always here for Rae
Solid
starts off great but the rest is just avergae  probably my least favourite album of theirs
if we look at SR3MM as 9 track album then this is probably their worst BUT there are some songs like Origami that bangs
Nothing from this duo will ever top the original Sremmlife for me. It came out at the perfect time, my freshman year of college. We added the entire album to our party playlist.   By the time Sremm3 came out, I was pretty tired of them. Maybe it‚Äôs just because of how long it‚Äôs been since then, but this album is hitting. Nothing amazing, but solid the whole way through. Origami, Royal Flush, Tanisha, Flaunt It/Cheap, and Mississippi Slide are standouts. I enjoy Leans Gone Cold too, but the mixing is just so jarring
I really enjoy it.
These Cartier's prescription, yeah, I'm lookin like a nerd
U good jimmy?  >My new addiction I need that (CRACK!)
I'm here for it!
Swae Lee sounds a bit different these days or is it just me
That ‚ÄúSexy‚Äù record fye
Pretty decent but am I the only that didn‚Äôt really feel like this album got promoted much?
album good af mississippi slide def best song
Damn had no idea it came out today, their first 3 albums was jamming.
Wondering if i should make time to see them at Coachella
Mixed so well
I need this to better my mood
Barney Stinson? Is that you?
Too bad this is y sounding like the summer album I was hoping for. It sounds so tame
You better be blasting Sexy when you win
the only thing I ever saw was swae talking about it on a random Snapchat post
They released a bunch of singles but none of them really caught on.
The not so bad snippets for the last like 2 years was the marketing lmao
Yea barely   They had an akademiks interview on akademiks' podcast and I saw another interview with raptv on YouTube   I heard about them planning to drop this album but didn't know it was gonna be so soon
This always seems to happen with them but something off the album usually blows up after it comes out
I remember they performed their hits at halftime of some football game I was watching on TV a few months ago.
I saw an announcement last week and somebody posted a Swae Lee ‚ÄúStan‚Äù sample. That was it.
I feel like they tweeted it and that was it
They dropped like 2-3 singles, none of them were good
Same I had no idea lol
Why did they mix it like that smh it's like swae is singing from a fucking cave
The transition to the studio version felt awkward
My guess is cus of the success of other social media post-samples like poland and just wanna rock. Artists are using pro mixing less and less these days, and going for raw content to keep the people clicking
Which song is that?
No flex zone üî•
They‚Äôre simply a relic of the mid-2010‚Äôs.   Just like Vanilla Ice was a relic of the early 90s.
I still play [23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbEoRnaOIbs) every now and then lol
Their mid 2010s run was incredible, swae lee especially is on some of the most iconic trap songs of all time. Legends of that era for sure
It feels very quiet plus swae has like 0 energy on it
Really missed opportunity here. What a shame...
There‚Äôs always the deluxe üôè if they do one I mean
Sremm 1 and 2 are straight flames.
their intros from 1-3 were so good, Up In My Cocina is underrated imo
Unlock the Swag is still hype as fuck. Sounds like the trap Neptunes
That intro with the bells or jingles and the lighter sound is still hype af.
who said they got that stanky loud? I wanna smell it
facts
I came into this without any real expectations, but a few songs in and these dudes really showed the fuck out in this. Shout out to Mike Will for bringing some refreshing production with this.
2014-2016 was a historic run for Rae Sremmurd
Facts,   Not so bad   Royal flush   Activate  Mississippi slide    Are good songs
Fr and the best part is they learned their lesson with Sr3mm and actually kept it at a reasonable length. 47 minutes is about as long as a sremmlife album should be.
It‚Äôs honestly really good. The chemistry between them and MIKE is always fun and refreshing. It‚Äôs just playful and silly and it‚Äôs needed from people that do it well. They really made a track called sexy and it was honestly probably what Drake tried to do on his last album but this felt more organic and better.
That sound brought me back so many memories from when I was a wee little lad
No one‚Äôs talking about this one in confused. They spazzed
The first part of the song sounds proper old school
in they bag whole track
That was the song that made me come onto reddit to see what people thought of it lol
Gives me fifa vibes
The mixing on Leans Gone Cold is terrible in general. Shame cuz I think its a good song
I need a new Thug album so bad man
Not so bad is so good but what the fuck man lol
Back to form then the next song was Pump thatüò≠üò≠üò≠  Edit: nvm musi got the track list wrong smh
Came here to say this. Straight FIRE!!
This is def better than sremm life 3 already
Most lit hip hop duo. Can't wait til they go on tour. Might do two stops tbh
My only problem is the mixing/vocals. Could be way cleaner. But this is a return to form for this duo otherwise
Yeah I just think they finally just accepted that their best style is the darkish/party trap music. It's like something you use to hype you up or celebrate. It's like something you listen to before a sports game or before going to a party. It's like concert music. They tried to hard to fit into like the regular music category and blow up to the normal person crown. If they can do it then fine but they excel together at the party music. Swae can also do club/trippy/chill music with his voice/style but it always falls short anyways. Clearly their writing talents are in trap. I think their voices and flexibility mean they could make almost any music genre, the issue is they clearly can't write in those genres. They'd need someone to lead, hence why swae Lee is so good on some features.
Consistent fire from this duo (mainly Swae). Super underrated imo. Gotta buy this in the morning
I love it to a degree. His live version is nice, but I woudlve wanted to see the studio version of the chorus
Goated shit
Yeah I‚Äôm on my 2nd listen and enjoying at least half the tracks. They have a bouncy fun feel and feels kinda fresh in 2023
I just think the songs aren‚Äôt as good on this one
respect offshore and the bedtime stories
So you liked the first 2 albums but don't like that now thT they're older and still rapping like their first two albums? They tired something different with the two individual albums. Didn't work. The party music is the lane they need to be in.
Activate was mediocre
Rae Sremmurd
with my mouth
yeah well we‚Äôll see what fantano thinksü§ì
Saul Goodman
HIMYM straight up the most underrated sitcom
you mean jimmi posting a girls asshole at a party
The biggest win is not having Community Dick on the album.
Because they were bad. Which was disappointing because I‚Äôve been anticipating this album for years
the sad thing is, it's just made to sound bad, this has probably been produced in a million dollar studio lol
Lean gone cold lol
Not So Bad (Leans Gone Cold)
Describing the mid-10s like it was decades ago is wild. Swae Lee ain‚Äôt even 30 yet lol
never in a million years did I think I would see vanilla ice‚Äòs name mentioned in the  discussion of this album
Miley went off
Played the shit out of this.  BANGERZ is still the best MC album too. IDGAF.
Ironically‚Ä¶. Right?
Still slaps to this day
sremm 1 was fucking crazy. so much raw energy
Disc 1 of SR3MM is just as good as their first two albums. The two solo discs that followed is questionable.
Best song for me personally
Oh my, I really can‚Äôt agree on that. This album feels so muted compared to their first couple projects. I see them as the titans of party rap and they can kinda fall flat outside of that
i kept looking for a song called Facts and thought I was going crazy lmao
i really enjoyed royal flush
Love me some thugger, love me some royal flush
Same
They whispering over the beat lmao
Bro gonna be waiting for a while üòÇ
Pump That‚Äôs a decent song bro bro
Hell no. You‚Äôre wildZ
their shows are super fun
Lean gone cold is the worst. It sounds like he didn‚Äôt even bother recording a studio version
Yeah Rae sremmurd isn‚Äôt rated by anyone, pretty dope up and coming group can‚Äôt wait to see what they do next!
Offshore is the only song from that album I still listen to
I hope there are people who can find enjoyment in any part of this album. I just really didn‚Äôt like it personally.
LMFAO
Lol people really hated that ending I guess
Best multicam of the late 2000's/early 2010's, easy.
Fr fr
What it's not underrated at all it was absolutely enormous at the time?!
i fell in love with that show‚Ä¶.the ending really killed my vibe and really felt pointless
come again?
Straight up terrible song. I was expecting so much better from a Flo Milli x Swae Lee collab.
I thought some of them were decent. I‚Äôll still play Denial occasionally. That one with Flo Milli was terrible tho.
tbf it‚Äôs almost been a decade since No Flex Zone dropped, and hip hop waves seem to last a year or two tops
I feel like the gif of Matt Damon turning old
Yet he‚Äôs made absolutely no progress artistically
Everything moves faster in the Internet age. News cycles, culture cycles, rap cycles.
Practically a grandpa.  Gonna put him in an assisted living facility next year.
> BANGERZ   Yo I also still rock [FU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRQEq1dbXl8) too. That song is fucking hard imo
No lol it was a banger back then and I still love it
Iconic college bar song of the early 2010s.
Disc 1 of SR3MM I actually fucking loved and still often re-visit. The two solo discs are unlistenable though imo.
agreed
Lol I should throw a comma after facts
Forreal üòî, I‚Äôm pretty sure he was in the middle or beginning of a rollout before he got locked up too  Only silver lining is I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a hundred unreleased Thug verses out there
Yeah I liked it also
Not like the bar was high lol 3 is ass
I believe it. Lit ass group. Can't wait for the tour dates. I fw the album. Hope you Sremm fans are eating. This much better than Sremm3
He literally didn‚Äôt ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
offshore a goated track fosho
The beginning with thugger is even better in the OG song he got it from. Called Rollercoaster by him
I liked some songs. They won‚Äôt  ever be able to capture their old peak, but I liek it nontheless
So much so they made an alternate ending.
I mean today. It feels like no one I talk to remembers it.
they had a sremm4 party and like three drunk chicks were making out and homie put her ass and pussy on his snap
Ehh, I‚Äôd say longer like 3-5 years but then again Im not sure what you mean by a wave.   Seems to me that the same artists that were hot in ‚Äò18 are hot now (Baby, Uzi, Travis Scott, Drake, 21 Savage, Future, Metro, Thug, etc)
It hasn't even been 8 years fam
Bruh I completely forgot about this song and am now dying in my room listening to it and reading you and the other dudes comments lol
Yeah he was about to drop. He posted the cover of the album then a month later got arrested
Thousands* according to the man himself. His vault is probably crazy, hell there's at least 2 albums worth of songs that would be near the top of his discography just from leaks we've already heard. Even if 1/50 of the songs he has in his vault are actually good, allegedly there's still enough be dropping albums for years.    As foul as it is to say, thug fans will be eating good once the lawyer fees start piling up, not to mention all the bills for supporting his 6 kids. He's probably going to be forced to drop from jail eventually. Although obviously he's going to avoid it for as long as possible while the trial is going because the last thing he needs is more lyrics being used against him or hurting his image
Probably did but this probably sounds better
Funny enough I saw the series finale the day it aired and didn‚Äôt think anything of it. It wasn‚Äôt until I watched the rest of the series 7 years later that I realized how bad the ending really was
they out there livin their best lives man
Damn, can we still find this footage somewhere?
Yeah I'm not talking about artists, more about sounds in general. For example: it's been about 2 years since WLR, and it feels like we're more or less at the end of the whole rage wave or w/e you wanna call it with dudes like Yeat and Destroy Lonely. It's not super scientific and the lines are blurry as hell, but I'd say you get 2 years tops from pioneers of a sound to the point where shit either gets a little too out there or becomes mad generic. You can see the same thing with the South Florida sound, lyrical lemonade type shit, we're in one right now with everyone and their mama lazily sampling early 2000s beats and chasing tiktok hits.  And all of those artists are still popular, but they've also all evolved their sounds and kept up w/ consistent output, while also being some of the main trendsetters in general. The guys that easily could have been victims of a "wave" (21, Uzi, Thug, Baby) have all made concerted efforts to put out good/unique music, and been pretty damn consistent.  Rae Sremmurd came in on a new wave, and promptly stopped giving a fuck post Sremmlife 2. Even that wasn't nearly as good as the first, but they had enough hits (Swang, Black Beatles) to keep some relevancy. The whole Sremmlife 3 triple album bullshit or whatever was just too much, too boring, and it only had one hit which was just a shittier version of a decent Three 6 song.
I would argue none of those artists are near as hot now as they were in '18 besides Drake
TIL may 2014 was less than 8 years ago
You make great points here I can see where you coming from!
Rlly lol I was just put on destroy lonely and yeat. I think their typa music is the next big wave
Lmao bro you know that‚Äôs 100% cap  Uzi got one of the biggest songs right now, Future won a Grammy, 21 been on two of the hottest albums in the last 9 months, Thug locked up but that‚Äôs clout in itself, Metro got one of the most streamed albums, and Travis Scott still has a highly anticipated album releasing soon. They‚Äôre all still top tier imo.
Dawg Uzi has a hit song where he says like 3 sentences over and over again and it's a fucking banger lol  Future and Baby are essentially untouchable and niggas are always gonna play their shit, 21 is just consistent as fuck, and Travis is probably gonna have a bunch of redditors clutching pearls when Utopia still does big numbers post-controversy.   Only one that fell off is Thug and it's really only because he's literally going to prison
üòÇ I can't believe it's that old
Homisexual üíÄ
I am loving this project way more than CS01‚Ä¶ Daniel Caesar‚Äôs really matured in this project and it feels like he‚Äôs been able to channel this more stripped-back, psychedelic sound into something focused and cohesive.  Gonna be playing this album for a long time. Fits the summer sound perfectly.
just finished. prob my favorite album of his. might be one of my favorites of the year so far. I don't think there's a song on here that I don't enjoy.   Highs: pain is inevitable, ocho rios, homiesexual, superpowers
Always and Toronto 2014 are awesome songs.
Valentina's gonna explode in plays
man this shit is hella fire his best since freudian
I fucking love danny caesar, safe to say this is gonna be good
Is it just me or the outro of Vince Van Gogh sounds like Frank on the Nikes music video version?
This is phenomenal
Saw Daniel at the fox theatre in Oakland pre Covid. One of the best performers and shows I‚Äôve ever been too. Core memory.
You can definitely feel a true progression from Freudian to CS101 to this project.  Sonically, it feels like his two previous albums combined with layers of new experimental production that somehow still feels stripped down. I really like the space he allows for the use of different instrumentals and there are a few melody "switchups" that took me by surprise.  Lyrically, there's still some typical corny lines, but I'd say it feels like a step up from the previous two projects. You can definitely feel the themes of emptiness, lonliness and longing/looking back on the past. That being said, if you like the simplicity of Freudian's lyricism, then you might not like this as much.  I need to sit with it more before I make final comparisons to Freudian or CS101, but as of right now I am enjoying it and definitely not a disappointment.  Homiesexual is THE song on this album though, that I can confidently say.  Early favorites (besides the singles) - Toronto 2014, Always, Disillusioned, Homiesexual
Honestly the singles are some of my least favourite songs on the album
Came out last night in Australia, listened through 3 times. This is phenomenal and one of my favourite R&B albums in years. Its a shame Daniel himself is such a dickhead because hes one of the most talented dickheads in all of music. The stretch from Let Me Go to Homiesexual is insane. Other than a few moments i didnt think were anazing (the writing on Vince Van Gogh is pretty lame, and Unstoppable/Valentina arent exactly mindblowing songs), this is a pretty incredible album.   Overall im feeling a 9/10 and confidently better than his last album. Well worth the wait.   Do yourself a favour and set aside an hour one night, take a night drive to this album. I did last night as soon as it dropped. And my god. It hit.  Fav song: Always, Cool, Let Me Go, Pain Is Inevitable, Homiesexual, Do You Like Me?  Least fav: probably Vince Van Gogh bc of the corny lyrics. Feels like a watered down version of the flexing he did on FRONTAL LOBE MUZIK from his last album, where he made:  > Used to be bummy and now i get to the racks, Used to be ugly but now I hit from the back   Sound hard as fuck.
Honestly exceeded my expectations. Not because I think lowly of his music, but the singles were just solid to me, nothing incredible like Freudian or the standouts on Case Study. But this is a really beautiful project.  Just wish he weren't such a dumbass and so fucking corny, then I could more proudly talk about his shit lmao.  EDIT: This shit is incredible. Best project since Freudian, and I'm feeling a good 9 honestly. Loved every track. Knew I'd like the deep cuts more since I wasn't feeling the singles too much but still liked them. This was a really incredible album though. Definitely going to be a classic down the line. Hopefully he learns how to keep his mouth closed when not singing from now on.  Ocho Rios is such a crazy good intro. Pain Is Inevitable is so gorgeous, especially the outro. Superpowers made me float. Loved every track though. Might be my AOTY unless Frank drops and depending on what Tyler does (and Peggy's other drops).
9/10 for me personally   And might be his best/most complete album for me. Feels like every pallet of daniels rnb i enjoy i get from this project. Enough alternative/rnb/acoustic/and whatever that somewhat western feeling u get on tracks like shot my baby
Toronto 2014 is special
I don't even check for Daniel Caesar like that. Listened to this because of the high praise and I'm blown away. One of the best albums I've heard in a long time!
Wow this album was fantastic
crazy to me how people are calling him an asshole over one ig live years ago and liking a video which had andrew tate in it  and wasnt even related to him . its like years ago at this point lol forgive the man for making some mistakes lol. people are so quick to judge it is insane. like have you never had a illnformed opinion in your life ?
I think ‚Äúcool‚Äù is the one. Something about it really clicks.
Definitely love the evolution from his last few projects. I absolutely loved all the singles so I was worried the rest of the tracks were gonna be forgettable.. but damn, Toronto 2014, Always, disillusioned and homiesexual are instant highlights for me. Gonna be spinning this one all summer.
Adding on to my previous comment, this is like the perfect child of Freudian and Case Study. The best elements of both and a beautifully consistent project. Might be his best but I can't put it above Freudian just yet. AOTY right now for me. Didn't think Scaring The Hoes would get  displaced so quickly. But Peggy is dropping again, and if Frank drops and Tyler drops (again) then there will be some competition. For now though, Danny has it.
Cool sounds like a Frank track.    Thank you Mr. Caesar for crushing my soul. This whole album reminds me of her.
been out since hours ago here, def an upgrade from his last album  my faves: Homisexual, Disillusioned, Buyer's Remorse, Do You Like Me, Valentina
By far his best. Phenomenal record.
this guy likes hella andrew tate tweets on twitter
üêê
Valentina and Disillusioned gonna go crazy in senior proms lol
Best album since Freudian. Hardly any skips and the vibes are consistent, this will be in my playlist for the rest of the year easily. Valentina is heavenly
incredible album .. wow
He's finally back  Great album
phenomenal, my favorite record he's ever did already
Track 11 uhhhhh
Crazy how one dude talks about DC liking Tate tweets and you got like 7 dickheads parroting it. Reddit undefeated.
homisexual is hot
This isn‚Äôt hip hop
Boring
am I the only one that feels a little let down by the album? the singles were the best songs for me apart from Shot My Baby.
Anyone who says this is better than CS01 is tripping for real. The lows in CS01 are still better than the highs here.
Hell yeah! I didn‚Äôt expect this today so I‚Äôll def be bumping this most the morning.
Toronto 2014 is the highlight for me on first listen
the outro for disillusioned is so good
Second lp should have been a mixtape and this the second. I like Daniel when he has interesting production, because sometimes his voice can be monotonous, but this one is great, Freudian remains undefeated
My fav one is Let Me Go sounds like Coldplay ü§ç The album is great tho
There are a couple standout tracks on here. Valentina (made with help from his producer brother), Toronto 2014 and Vince Van Gogh were my favorites listening through once. Homiesexual was worth a listen, aided by Ty Dolla $ign. Unfortunately, I didn't feel like the highs were enough to carry the whole album. There are a lot of songs that just felt boring. Maybe as background / mood music it's fine, but I didn't feel the album as a whole surpassed that general characterization.  There were some cool beats, but lyrically I expected better. Trying to rhyme 'profit' with 'prophet' - seriously? Homiesexual and Valentina were high points, but a lot of the rest frankly sounded like copypasta from every other R&B album. For all his talk about introspection, it sounded more narcissistic and shallow to me. I'm glad he read at least a little about psychology, but it sounded more pseudo-intellectual than anything else.  Verdict: There are a few bangers in here, but after waiting so long for that elusive breakthrough R&B album to follow up 'Freudian' and push the genre to its next evolution, I'm disappointed this wasn't it.
incredible album .. wow
Shot my baby is the guy version of Kill Bill. Lessgooo
As of 3 listens in, I still think "Freudian" is his masterpiece but this one is GOOD. Def better that CS01. Not that I hated that project but, we all know it's gripes.
I got that thuggin love
KNOW YOU WAS SICK OF MY SHIT
Pushing 30 talkin bout homiesexual
W pfp
Exactly how I feel. Fifteen track album and I loved every song. Incredible shit.
Only a few songs in but really enjoying Toronto 2014
Honest, that one was a nice track
aka better than Case Studies
Yep.
second half of vince van gogh gives major frank vibes
Glad im not the only one who thought that
Not the first time he bites his music
the intro to this album also sounds almost uncannily like ‚Äúat your best you are love‚Äù by frank.
I thought the start of Always sounded very Frank-esque too but I'm not complaining I love it
I‚Äôve seen him three times. He‚Äôs so good live probably my favorite rnb performer. Even at festivals like Coachella and Lollapalooza he commands the crowd so well and his voice is the exact same. Def recommend watching him in an intimate setting with a significant other on weed or shrooms lmao.
I was there too!!! I remember him playing the stripped down version of Open Up with the live band and after that I hunted that version down RELENTLESSLY til I found grainy YouTube footage somewhere. What an amazing show.
The second half of Toronto 2014 was brilliant, so vulnerable.
Same. Thought they were good but not particularly interesting and knew I'd like the deep cuts more. Album blew me away overall.
Actually glad to hear that because I listened to the singles and few days and wasn‚Äôt super excited.
you seriously calling him a dickhead over 1 ig live he did 4 years ago lol
Agreed 100%
His music is so good, but he just has to open his mouth when it comes to non music stuff
It so strange how i want to consider yachty but I genuinely feel like the production/sound of that album is why id do it. He‚Äôs ironically the weakest part of the project in total to me
Reddit moment
Hivemind redditors
While he's a brilliant artist he's unfortunately one of the biggest pseudo intellectuals around. Man is insanely pretentious and moronic.
say it ain't so
I swear he talked about being ‚Äústuck in the matrix‚Äù in one of the songs as wellüò≠ he seems like a dickhead but at least the musics really good
Are you sure he does? The only thing I see is him liking [this](https://twitter.com/SlavaP/status/1633272276735893504) whch while weird isn't an endorsement of Andrew Tate per se   Not denying he has some off, right-wing views but I don't see anything showing he has some sorta Andrew Tate obsession, though he might've unliked stuff I suppose
How the hell does this shit have 40 upvotes when it isnt true, this is how fake news gets spread like wildfire. If this was a tweet, people would probably never let it go
god it took me forever to get over the yesjulz bullshit and now this, fucking hell daniel why can't u just be normal
I followed him early on on ig/twitter he would repost jordan peterson clips
Hes been giving weird energy for a while
oh no..
nooo üò≠üò≠
He's a "white lives matter also" type dude
Biggest reason why he ain‚Äôt big. His music is amazing, but he just kept talking
Wtf
Omg, what a criminal!
And?
[Been discussed](https://reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/12e90f1/_/jfa6w3t/?context=1)
Read the sub‚Äôs info lol,   > Everything hip-hop, R&B and Future Beats! The latest mixtapes, videos, news, and anything else hip-hop/R&B/Future Beats related from vour favorite artists
To add to the other comments, I must say the R&B reddits are trash lol. r/rnb's Daniel Caesar post has 0 comments at the time of this writing, and r/rnbheads doesn't even have the new album posted -\_-
R&B is very close to Hip Hop mostly due to how much they overlap and the influence each has on each other so it gets discussed here
R&B and Hip Hop are siblings.
there are about 3 good songs on CS01. this album clears it
Pretty insane take. Case Study is crazy inconsistent. About four genuinely great tracks on it and the rest are meh. This goes 15 for 15. Not a single miss and nearly every song is amazing.
DO THE HOMIE!
Do the thugshaker
True
The highs on Case Study are incredible but it's not consistent at all. There are like four or five genuinely great songs and everything else is pretty meh. This practically goes 15 for 15.
Frank Ocean didn't invent lowering vocal pitch. Everyone knows that ASAP Rocky invented that in 2011
that's literally an aaliyah song
My guy, he absolutely is a dickhead. Look at the shit he posts between Jordan Peterson and his pseudo intellectual philosophy experiments on IG lmao  You can still like him. Hell, I do. I love his music and I still listen to him because I find it insane that people will stop listening to him before abusers like Chris brown and pedophiles and rapists like R Kelly.   But you can like him and acknowledge his many faults
There are other reasons too, such as liking Andrew Tate videos on Twitter. A lot of people on this thread don't like him apparently but I think it is for more than just that one IG Live.
Hes an andrew tate fan i literally checked his likes on twitter to make sure i wasnt tripping. And someone else commented it too. Andrew tate is a disease, anyone who supports him is a garbage human being
There was literally only that 1 IG live he did 4 years ago, you guys acting like he's preaching stuff non stop
Exactly. Like if he just focused on music and shut the fuck up on everything else, he'd be thriving.  Unfollowed him on Insta for a period of time because he was just posting the most moronic and pretentious shit.   Absolutely love his music but he's the epitome of a pseudointellectual
I feel similarly. I mean I think it's a good project but not as mind-blowing as others do. And Yachty's voice is unfortunately the biggest detractor which is a pretty big deal when he didn't entirely self produce the project in the first place. But still a very good album and a good step for him.
the dumbest people will always try to be the smartest in the room, same energy as kyrie, jaylen brown, etc.
I believe it, he was a white lives matter person lol
There‚Äôs a reason he ain‚Äôt as big. Bro has the potential to be huge if he just kept his damn mouth shut
bro likes one randy marsh joke and then gets labeled as an andrew tate supporter üò≠
Because people lack critical thinking skills.
Mfs just be lyingüóø
I went through months of his tweets and he didn't like a single tweet by Andrew Tate, just one joke tweet about an Andrew Tate clip   I do think he has some questionable opinions as the "stop being mean to white people" thing shows but this particular Andrew Tate thing doesn't seem to be true as far as I can tell
Bro you‚Äôre making assumptions off a liked tweet
Open Up, Are you OK, Complexities, Cyanide, Entropy, Superposition‚Ä¶ These are all great songs. I don‚Äôt see anything on par in the new album that I could compare with these.
After reading stuff here I do feel like I am taking crazy pills but this album is consistent yet average, nothing special like ‚ÄúOpen Up‚Äù or ‚ÄúAre You OK‚Äù. To me, CS01 is perfect apart from the obvious ‚ÄúLove Again‚Äù. I just don‚Äôt see anything that could compare with ‚ÄúOpen Up‚Äù in this album. This being said, I don‚Äôt like Freudian that much either. I think CS01 is simply my sound.
I got to watch during the Nurture tour and it was so amazing. The usage stage visuals was incredible and probably one of the best visual performances I‚Äôve been able to watch
There is no way to see the shit he posts on Jordan Peterson because that was in 2018 lol, again it's obvious you're actually just basing your comment on someone else's comment.  And tbf Jordan Peterson used to be alot more tame 5 years ago, and I also dont remember which videos of his Daniel posted
bro ? jordan peterson had a very different public perception back in 2018 .
Except he didn't actually do that, you literally just read that from another comment on this thread and it isn't even true lol
He literally isn't lol, there's just one random comment about that here and now people are running with it when it isn't true.  If he was actually liking andrew tate tweets, people on Twitter would have been on his ass about it
You're really on his dick, damn.   Fact of the matter is he never truly apologized for that shit. He gave a half assed response and has done more stupid shit since them. Daniel is (unfortunately) one of my favorite artists and biggest influences musically. Doesn't change the fact that he's a dumbass.
Exactly buncha Cornballs so obsessed over some dumb thing he said drunk on ig live 4 years ago.
This isn't even true, massive difference between what he said in his IG live and being a "white lives matter" person
Doubt the public knows about the tweets he likes tbf
There was a video of R Kelly pissing on an underage girl released in 2002 and he still went on to collab with Usher, Jay Z, Ludacris, Lady Gaga, Justin Bieber, Snoop Dogg, The Game and more.  I don't think Daniel Caeser is being blackballed for that IG live and some Twitter likes.
>	There‚Äôs a reason he ain‚Äôt as big  no one knows about anything y‚Äôall are talking about in this thread
You just made that up
Classic reddit
ok god bless
bro scrolled through months of likes to verify i‚Äôm weak
Interesting. Pretty rare take for a Daniel fan so I respect it.  Open Up and Are You Ok are some of my favorites on Case Study. Strange to me that you think this is average when many songs are reminiscent of Case Study though. But I'm glad you know what you like.
Same here, very awesome experience
That was not 2018 lmao. He's posted shit about him in the past year or two. I'm not basing my comment on someone else's bullshit lmao. I've seen it with my own eyes because as I said, he's one of my favorite artists.  And I don't care how other people perceive Jordan. He's always been a fuckhead to me.
 I don't care how other people perceive Jordan. He's always been a fuckhead to me.
I opened Twitter myself and checked it before I commented though so ???  He has liked two Andrew Tate tweets in the past month, so what they're saying is true.
That's reddit for you.
dude im telling u i scrolled his likes and saw an andrew tate video literally right there. its that corny ass video tate made about trans people or some shit
I saw an Andrew Tate tweet and video of Andrew Tate within 10 seconds of scrolling through his likes (neither of them are anything bad but jus saying)
I agree with the one incident for sure but the issue is you then saying "he's done more bad stuff since then" when he actually hasn't lol, it's just people riding a hate train without actually looking into anything themselves.  I don't even listen to Daniel like that, I just think it's a shame people here have just a hivemind without using their own brain.
You lost the argument here mate
One of those tweets about Andrew Tate saying he met some south park character and another is someone quoting an Andrew Tate video with the quote tweet having nothing to do with Andrew tate,  conext matters lol
It's quite insane how, nowadays, you can get cancelled for merely liking a tweet. This shit gotta stop.
It's not Andrew's tweet, it's Daniel's irl friend quote tweeting an Andrew Tate video with the quote tweet saying "I used to ask every guy in jail this question", the tweet Daniel liked has nothing to do with Tate himself.  It's basically his friend saying he used to ask guys in jail if they'd fuck dudes, which sure is a bit of an odd tweet but hardly makes him a dickhead lol
He literally has?  I mean what you consider bad is subjective, but I find him awfully pretentious and questionable in certain takes.
Lmao, saying I've lost an argument because I don't like Jordan Peterson is a very brilliant take.  There wasn't an argument dumbass. I didn't like Peterson in 2018 and I don't like him now. That's not an argument. It's a simple statement.
Honest question tho, why would you like Tate tweeting about meeting some South Park character if you didn't also like Tate?
Right, and I don't care about that stuff and I still listen to his music and enjoy it. I can't say if he is a nice guy or not.  I just think there are some other things that might be contributing to people not liking him
Truly insane.
You‚Äôre the only one talking about cancelling him over this, stop making up problems to argue against
Ok it seems ive misinterpreted the tweet then. Im still cautious considering others talking about his support of Jordan Peterson, as he is a very influential individual who constantly spouts misogynist, transphobic and other bigoted talking points. If he does support him thats pretty telling. But ive never seen it myself
Okay if he has like you are claiming, provide some examples. Jesus, I‚Äôm not even a huge Daniel Caesar fan and even you are pissing me off lmao
because his tweets are so unintentionally funny.
you know how insane that is. Let me be cautious about something he did 5 years ago.  Like everyone is a little fuckin prick at one point or another get over it.  You can‚Äôt hold that against them especially when he hardly did anything wrong.  He commented under a couple videos.  Like what‚Äôs this obsession people have of holding others, esp young people rising to fame, to an impossible standard for their entire life and then even if they improve no one gives a shit like cmon.
Read any of my other comments and I have? Lmao.  Getting pissed off because you refuse to read isn't my problem. A bit tired of repeating the exact same thing.
Exactly lol, his tweets come up on my tineline even though I don't follow him and alot of them are funny even if he doesn't mean them to be
Real shit
He‚Äôs just trying to fit the typical redditor mold. He‚Äôs basing how he thinks on upvoted comments he‚Äôs seen on other threads and regurgitating it here.
It‚Äôs the problem with human internally, we hold the worst things about people, specifically men, for so long instead of helping them get better
Bruh maybe I‚Äôm missing something but I‚Äôm not seeing a single comment of yours which explains it
Exactly lol, that's exactly what I expected.  Claim he's a bad person, don't elaborate, and then get mad at people asking you to elaborate
There aren't that many comments in this thread my guy. Do some reading.
BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS! BEST COUPLE IN THE UNDERGROUND I LOVE EM SO MUCH

This is absolutely insane considering earlier today it was announced the guys who killed X got life sentences.
FOUR YEARS??? A man is DEAD.
He got off light
4 years?  Add 2 more 0s to that bruh
Kim Wexler hooked him up
Nah idc if he was underage when he killed him, he scouted the house and knew exactly what he was doing
4? Niggas out here getting 20+ for weed possession dawg üòÇ
Four years is all a man‚Äôs life is worth? We take murder way too lightly in this world.
He will get out and get right back to it. Others will be victimized by this person because of this judge.
Oooooooh he snitchin
he isn't the one whot shot him, read the fucking article guys
Wtf
Gotta love California
Fuck four years, give this bitch life!
Dude didn‚Äôt kill just Pop, he killed an entire branch of hiphop and the hopes and dreams of a lot of people at Pop‚Äôs side
Almost none of you read the article.  But wanna argue about ‚Äúwho deserves what‚Äù and what‚Äôs considered ‚Äúunfair‚Äù.
So the shooter gave Pop Smoke a death sentence via his gun and he only gets four years?  What?
‚Äúfree tayk he was just a kid.‚Äù And then there‚Äôs ‚Äúso what‚Äôs if he‚Äôs a kid he killed popsmoke‚Äù   üò≠ crazy differences in opinions
This is why Republicans should run America.
People get more time in prison for possession then they do ending another mans life
4 fucking years.  Are you kidding me ?
Mac Miller‚Äôs drug dealer who sold him fent got 17 years I think. 4 years is crazy low.
I read the article and his sentencing was light for 2 reasons : 1. he took a plea for manslaughter and 2. because he was a minor at the time of Pop‚Äôs murder -so he wasn‚Äôt tried/ sentenced as an adult.   But nonetheless this was cold, calculated and senseless . . even if his intent wasn‚Äôt to kill Pop and to rob him he still killed!!!!! Didn‚Äôt dude who made ‚Äúthe race‚Äù song get 100 years or something like that he‚Äôs young too? Idk what to make of this   Pop is gone forever and the woman that was with him that night spoke about the incident . . I can‚Äôt even imagine the trauma connected with witnessing that . . . as much as I‚Äôm pro criminal justice reform and all that this sentencing just feels wrong still Idk
4 years is definitely low but the guys that killed X got charged for more than just that. They went around robbing people all day and filmed it.
Extremely light
I‚Äôm usually the first to say that throwing a kid in prison for life solves almost nothing, and we should focus more on rehabilitation, but this part of the article is wild and I‚Äôm surprised the judge was not way harsher.  >Deputy Dist. Atty. Hilary Williams told a judge at a hearing in August that the defendant who pleaded guilty Thursday was no minor participant in the crime: He scouted the mansion, helped Walker recruit three other juveniles to rob Jackson and, after entering the home, remained in ‚Äúconstant communication‚Äù with Walker, who waited in the getaway car.  >From a wiretap on his phone, detectives learned he‚Äôd committed other robberies, Williams added.  >Martin Lijtmaer, the attorney for the defendant who plead guilty Thursday, argued his client was intellectually disabled, sparking a years-long series of examinations and hearings over his competency to stand trial.  >Jody Ward, a psychologist who examined the defendant on behalf of the prosecution, testified in August that he appeared to be faking the disability.  >He was diagnosed as a child with a learning disability but tested at an ‚Äúaverage‚Äù level in school, which he stopped attending regularly after the second grade, Ward said. Arrested for the first time at 14, he was referred to the Los Angeles County Regional Center for the Developmentally Disabled, where his IQ was gauged at just 52. Ward said this was inexplicable: Tested in school, he was found to have an IQ of 92, an average level.  Then continues on about a fake cellmate they planted to get more info, with an insane quote about OJ. This whole thing is so strange  >	After he was arrested, the defendant showed a familiarity with the judicial process that belied his alleged disability, Ward testified. He planned with his cellmate ‚Äî a plant for the police, who were secretly recording the conversation ‚Äî how to glean information from detectives without giving anything up himself, Ward said.  >‚ÄúOJ was able to beat his case even though there was blood on his socks,‚Äù he told his cellmate, according to Ward. But if all else failed, ‚ÄúI still got that Regional Center s‚Äî,‚Äù he said, a reference to the facility where he‚Äôd been diagnosed as disabled.
Why u tryna lock a black man up for 400 years ü§®
With her wack ass ponytail
I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs a typo, but dwag is something I used to say with an old friend of mine   Thanks for making me think of them
He was a huge part of setting the whole thing up and was involved and in communication with the killers the entire time the crime was being committed.
7 out of 10 people don't read articles
"Trump wasn't actually part of J6"
>he isn't the one whot shot him, read the fucking article guys  It's reddit, people don't read articles
shut the fuck up bozo
Wrong. Just because your mom made the wrong decision on whether or not to abort you doesn‚Äôt mean everyone else deserves to have that choice taken away
Go to r/politics if you want to be political
> didn't dude who made "the race" song get 100 years or something like that he's young too?  Tay K got 55 years, but also committed more crimes than this guy. he was on the run for a while and beat and robbed an old guy
>because he was a minor at the time of Pop‚Äôs murder -so he wasn‚Äôt tried/ sentenced as an adult  Man. They totally got scammed on that one.  Dudes adult enough to be tried as an adult.
Hopefully he gets it good in prison. Hopefully he doesn‚Äôt make it out.  ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I smell a deal
Yeah I usually am wary of trying kids as adults, but that kid is seriously manipulative and it‚Äôs hard to imagine that he doesn‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs doing
weak bait
Ok that‚Äôs not what this is. Don‚Äôt talk about my queen like that üò§
Say what u want about Kim but that ponytail was A+
was a typo indeed. corrected, thanks for lmk!!
Make that 9.5
ohh okay I see but still, a murder? I feel like murder trumps a bunch of lesser crimes but I‚Äôll have to look into that Tay k case
**MY THOUGHTS EXACTLY** . . .  Pop was only 20 himself these guys that robbed and killed him weren‚Äôt to far apart in age, it shows if one could manage business, contracts, a career and busy schedule at their age and be on the come up than why couldn‚Äôt they . . . I just really can‚Äôt imagine doing something like that to someone, smh
I feel kinda bad but I was secretly thinking that üò¨ . . but they‚Äôre felons now so I‚Äôm sure their life will be fxcked even if they don‚Äôt get got while they‚Äôre in  maybe as they age they‚Äôll go to an adult facility and then they‚Äôll have the same chances as Nip‚Äôs killer . . I just feel like death is permanent and to take a life and  in such a horrible way (this wasn‚Äôt a self defense scenario they were robbing him) I just don‚Äôt feel any pity or sympathy for them ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
I'm not a psychologist but this mfer sounds just like any number of anti social violent mfers you grow up with in the hood
Idk it‚Äôs hard to tell because obviously there is a lot more case information that isn‚Äôt being shared with the public. This is just what the LA Times decided/ were given permission to share.   The fake cellmate is a crazy thing to me. Honestly I don‚Äôt care who it is, that shit is weird and twisted and could surely easily be weaponized in horrible ways.  But at the same time 4 years is light even if you are looking at this situation charitably and are only focussed on this kid getting rehabilitated. Especially if he was the mastermind behind the robbing with prior offenses.
Murder is murder.. if you take a life as an adolescent you shouldn‚Äôt come home for at least 10-15 years. That way by the time you get out you‚Äôll be fully developed mentally and have a true understanding of your actions. This sentence is nothing more than finishing school for this pos.
More like a joke that flew over your head‚Ä¶
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
he was up for a murder too, that's what he was on the run for
I doubt they will be.   I mean, 4 years is nothing.  They basically got away with it while facing as little punishment as possible.
Adolescents who pose a risk to others should definitely be is isolated, but it‚Äôs not like our current system is built for rehabilitation
jokes generally are funny
Damn . . I only know of him because of the viral song and the commentary that surrounded his sentence but I didn‚Äôt know anything of what he was doing that‚Äôs crazy  this sentencing is still crazy to me though because these guys pistol whipped and robbed Pop before shooting him multiple times . . nothing about this seems deserving of 4 years ya know? Idk
I agree but I‚Äôm sure people in LA know who they are . . plus they have a record now so the life they will have after this probably isn‚Äôt gonna be anywhere near pleasant but they did that to themselves
It was funny lol. They‚Äôre referring to Kanye‚Äôs quote
Bruh the song is him on the run, like I think it was recording at a random studio while fleeing
People on this app take everything way to literal and serious that‚Äôs why people gotta use a  /s here to indicate sarcasm
yes I got that, I didn‚Äôt know the cause of his legal situation I just assumed it was something dumb like drugs or whatever. . . 42 Dugg violated his pretrial bond, NBA violated his pretrial bond, so did Kodak . . alot of rappers do and it makes the news and it‚Äôs whatever I don‚Äôt look into everyone‚Äôs legal case  tay k wasn‚Äôt someone I was even aware of, with ‚Äúthe race‚Äù song and that infamous tweet I figured he was young and dumb and in legal trouble for something light I ain‚Äôt know dude killed someone and all the other shit that lead to his house arrest in the first place . . . sheesh
or - and hear me out on this one      it just wasnt funny
Listen the lyrics he spells it out it‚Äôs kinda darkly funny
