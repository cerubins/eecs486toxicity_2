>Trade Tebow for some more picks or move him to TE  Man is a prophet
Not the Tim Tebow stans
> Yes, go for Manning if he can play.  Trade Tebow for some more picks or move him to TE, draft or trade for a more pure QB prospect and train him under Manning for a couple years.  u/supermulticoated was a decade ahead of his time
I like how this is tagged roster move, I'm like "did I just go back in time?"
Nah don't sign Peyton Manning, it hurts your chances to get Mike Wallace.
Honestly the Tebowmania run was wild enough to watch as an outside fan that I don't blame the Broncos fans who were believers
I remember being mad at the signing because we gave him a 5/100 mil deal.. lol He gave us the best 4 yr stretch of football in Denver in my life (I was young during Elways tenure). Also helped make DT a Pro Bowl amazing WR and who is now on my personal favorite Bronco ever. Ignore Flair I love both teams Denver is my hometown team and ive been watching MN since 98.
Wasn’t he coming off a nasty neck injury   I’d be skeptical too
I'm not gonna say I'm innocent, but I *hate* it when people now comment in old threads like these.  That being said, these takes are hilarious.
I remember reading takes from people back then and thinking most folks had lost their minds thinking Tebow could develop. Pre-Manning, I was drinking Tebow hopium, once we had a shot at Manning? I was all about sacrificing the Virgin Timmy to Blucifer for a title lol
I remember I really wanted him largely because he would destroy us when he was on the Colts. I liked Tebow and was hoping he would get a shot elsewhere but you can't pass up on an all-time great like that even with that neck injury.
I always thought you couldn't comment in threads over 6 months old. Did reddit change that recently?
Steroids do wonders
Everyone commenting random shit on that thread now is just further proof of why we can't have commercial time travel tourism
a friendly reminder that it’s one of the worst team subs
This is funny but the ppl commenting right now are cringe
Imagine passing on a 35 year old Manning. I know his neck was a concern, but he was flirting with 🐐 status either way.
Patrick wilis
We’re not that deep into the offseason yet.
Ok
Broncos fans are a bunch of chickenshit morons. Imagine saying "no" to Peyton Manning.
Every time I see one of these retrospective threads I’m reminded why some people are GMs and not any of us
All the people going in there now and talking shit are dorks
When exactly did Peyton get hurt? Was it that preseason game against Washington?
People were saying he should've been TE or FB  in the NFL before he even left college to go to the NFL.
But he won a playoff game
I’m a diehard Gators fan. I loved Tebow at UF. But even I knew Gainesville was as far as his career would go. On no planet was Tebow worth anything higher than a late 3rd/early 4th round pick.
Found Urban Meyers burner account.
They did that, Brock Osweiler didn't exactly work out.
>did I just go back in time?  You finally woke up, welcome back. I like that new song, Little Talks by Of Monsters and Men.
Stupid auto-moderator lmfao. Automatically did it on key words.
That one had me dying laughing lol.
The guy won a playoff game completing 10 passes. How could you not think he was god's QB lol
You can have 2 teams on your flair now I believe.
Couldn’t even grip a football for a while and no one knew if he could even suit up again. It was a big risk.
It's so lame. In 11 years, pretty much any prediction any of us make is going to look dumb. Commenting on these threads with a decade of hindsight is supremely annoying.
Might be before auto-archival and Reddit never grandfathered in older posts, other then that idk.
I mean 4 neck surgeries is no joke. His arm strength was also zapped from it, look at his arm power in 2009 and 2010 vs. 2012 and 2013. I had a feeling he would come back because he was Peyton Manning but it was a valid reasoning.
We’re almost 2 months without football
Most of the league did
That's pretty common with the physical QBs, at least the ones that have the prototypical build for a TE. People been saying that about Cam for years.
The only QB the Broncos have ever drafted to start and win a playoff game
Delete this
I know it's been a sore subject for my flair specifically, but playoff win discourse is getting more and more infuriating when it's seemingly the first thing people jump to 90% of the time. Who cares if a random 10-win team won a wild card game and then got smoked in the next round, I'd still rather be a dominant team who gets the bye and then chokes. Past playoff success isn't really a good predictor of future playoff success anyway, just look at the Ravens themselves.
I meant converting Tebow to a TE
Fuck that song's 11 years old now
I'm from the year 2023 and it's nothing but Hey Folk songs, you have to stop it before it's too late.
Bro, I am very high rn and this is sending me to the moon lmao
"As a Ravens fan with a soft spot for Mike Wallace, let's not be too hard on him" is something 2012 me could never imagine saying but here we are
Oh damn.. I am gonna check that out. Thanks for the heads up.
Can confirm
You mean when he came back and set the season passing yards record? His arm was fine and then just died his last year
It was a valid concern but when the upside is that high you take the risk every time
Well he has God on his side.
But what about that one guy
Pretty sure that dude was being sarcastic
People were saying that while he was still in college about to declare for the draft. A lot of people were saying he would never make it at QB and he should play TE or FB / some sort of HB.
It's pretty great.
Having a team in each conference doesn't feel wrong, so long as you root for your primary whenever they play. I'd love a Bears/Jags SB, but would root for the Bears, no question
How did you do it?
[Unfortunately he only had half the necessary equation on his side](https://i.imgur.com/BY3zlp4.png)
If you’re referring to Elway, he was drafted by the Colts and the Yankees
I know, I was agreeing with the sarcasm
This makes me curious which MLB franchise has the best all-time football roster.  Elway actually played half a season in the minors for the Yankees too
Until Stafford won a Super Bowl with the Rams, the Detroit Tigers had drafted more Super Bowl Winning QBs (Mahomes) than the Lions. Tom Brady was the last active professional athlete who was drafted by the Expos
Russell Wilson played for the Yankees too  https://www.mlb.com/news/russell-wilson-gets-at-bat-for-yankees-c267678186
Broncos country, let's strike
Damn I forgot they are still negotiating that trade lol.
You couldn't waterboard this out of a GM if it wasn't 100% happening
This idea that he might not be a Jet is just so the media has something to talk about. He will be a jet. A trade will get done. There is zero doubt.
Jets legend ~~Brett Favre~~ Aaron Rodgers.
something something leverage something something
But will he bring the stache?
I completely forgot this trade is still going on lol
JD is one of the most likable GMs in the league. I really hope he succeeds, and not just because I’m a Jets fan (but also that).
Can't fuckin wait
That is technically true either way - the Packers play the giants
Dear God, June cannot come soon enough for so many fandoms.
Say it with me now: L E V E R A G E!
Gutie must be the reincarnation of Archimedes with all this leverage they’re handing him.
all that to get smacked by mahomes 😹
Nothing would be more Jets than Rodgers not playing for them this year.
Rodgers is washed. He doesn't have it anymore, and this is yet another classic jets debacle
Even if they get him, they in the tough AFC, it’s not like the jets becomes the favorites to reach the Superbowl. Jets fans acting like that’s the case.
Also coming:  \- 2nd place in the division  \- 1st round exit
Yeah, it's 100% happening after the draft, possibly before but not likely.
Did Rogers ever make it out of the dark room? Or did he overdose on ayahuasca? This feels like a weekend at Bernie’s situation
they are going to announce it the week of the draft so that they have even more for the talking heads to talk about that week
For the love of cheese just let this be over with already
By the way, unrelated to this, God bless Al Dukes. My dude just wants to go back to Bradley Beach 😔
I’m sure they’re at a point where serious fluctuations in the package are impossible, which is why he’s doing this  The best source was Charles Robinson, and he reported they’re arguing over a 2025 comp pick
My Dad looked at me like I had a second head when I said that technically this trade hasn't gone through.
I could see it being a draft day deal
I want to say 100% but 99.999999999% is probably what I'm feeling right now considering I wouldn't put it past the Jets or Aaron Rodgers to fuck this up
DAE how funny would it be if the Jets didn't get Rodgers after this ???????
When you're a Jet, you're a Jet all the way   from your first intercept   to your last garbage play...
Love in 10 years
Opposite opposite leverage opposite opposite
He'll need to consult a barber in the dark for that one.
You have been and will continue to wait lmao
I’d still take getting smacked by mahomes in the playoffs over not making the playoffs
Just curious, who beat the Steelers the last time they were in the playoffs?
Jamal Adams
[right on cue](https://i.imgur.com/sVLN8nK.png)
Imagine getting fleeced by a franchise you use as a punchline   Those firsts helped us attract the guy
most original joke
Lions fans are so sure a man that has absolutely DICKED them down for years is bad after the one year he didn't put up godly numbers has been hilarious
Are they?
I don't think a single Jets fan has said getting Rodgers puts them over the Chiefs for SB favorite....
> 100% happening after  …  > possibly before
You have it mixed lol
How’s Jalen doing with his ring?
Both sides really like to do all this talking, but we getting no movements. The fans are the ones suffering lmfao
It’s been weeks lol.     I can’t imagine most trades take even close to this long. Seems like somebody’s playing hard-ball and the other side isn’t having it. Could be real petty 🤷‍♂️
Joe Douglas reveals the slip of paper “A-A-Ron Rodgers no matter what”
“i hOpE iT fAlLs tHrOuGh”- usually an afc east flair
It would be interesting to see how the Packers handled it since he’d likely show up to get his money now.
Clearly the Jets can easily pivot to Lamar
Jordan Jet
Please please just get it done please please
6 more weeks of deciding compensation.
mad
Playoff Drought
Something Something Longest Playoff Drought Something Something.
How fun go have Jets fan also back up Rodgers. Yeah he was bad last year because he literally had no receivers and played with a broken thumb on his throwing hand
I've watched him for 15 years, he was distinctly worse last year
The disappointment jets fans get from actually getting Rodgers is going be hilarious next year
This guy hasn’t met alot of Jets fans .
Only person I’ve seen say that is Craig Carton and Jets fans hated it.
Listen man, I don't know about you but my mom told me to always give 110%.   I mean, I don't...but the math checks out
Yes, the only way he gets traded before the draft is if they don't get the high picks they want for this year. The Jets can wait until after and then GB has no leverage at all and doesn't want his salary on the books or him behind Love and GB fans calling for him to play because Love is bad.
I've been cutting myself
Each side just wants to get the most possible. Packers kinda have the leverage, I think NY will give in.  GB can just say "well ok we can just start Love while Rodgers retires" 🤷‍♂️   Rodgers has like 2 years left at most
This isn’t most trades, if both sides were playing hardball to the point where the trade could fall through, this wouldn’t be happening
A lot of NFC flairs doing that as well
The worst thing for the Packers is that he comes back as a backup sitting there collecting his paycheck. Every talk radio show and sports segment is gonna be begging him to come back after Love has a bad game. They need him out of the picture completely for this to work.
Punxsutawney Phil Simms?
Nope. Just couldn’t help myself.
OROY and DROY
And it’s going to end because of that team outsmarting yours  God bless Seattle
Even as a non homer, it was obvious he played hurt and had way less receiving talent around him than he ever did. We dragged Zach Wilson and Mike White to a 7-10 record
Bum didn't even win 3 straight MVPs :(
So were his WRs. What a coincidence
> he was distinctly worse last year  He had a broken thumb for most of the year, also fucked ribs, also no WR 1 or 2 or a TE worth a shit, also an OL that was injured / bad. To act like he still isn't a top QB is laughable.
Yet when your daddy puts up MVP numbers your Stockholm syndrome will kick in and be like "Of course he did, he's dicked us down for years"
You could take all the all pros from this year and put all of them on our roster and half of us would be saying Mahomes is a system QB who can't handle NYC. And that half the roster just had an abnormally good year last year and will crash down to earth
Those wounds will all heal once he’s ours baby
The only thing NY has to give in at this point is 2025 insurance  I think they will
I really hope you’re right about how much Rodgers has left in the tank, but I’m not gonna hold my breath…
Man they’re acting like they’re drawing up new state lines in some old American constitution or something. Or negotiating for hostage releases. It’s Aaron Rodgers going to the Jets. How fucking long is this going to take? I’ve never seen something *this* drawn out..
I honestly believe Rodgers doesn't retire then. The packers save 20 million dollars if they trade him. They don't have the leverage
Either way it’s getting ridiculous. We’re almost a month in. What more could there possibly be to discuss? Get the damn thing done.
Not nfc north, or cowboys flairs
you're right m8 if it means getting Arod I'll do what needs to be done
Honestly, I'll believe when I see it. Until then, it's not really worth proclaiming.
Oh he's definitely better than Zach Wilson and Mike White. Washed Aaron Rodgers is still good enough for playoffs, he's just not carrying you
You're getting late career Peyton Manning. If you win it will be because of your defense, not Aaron Rodgers
Exactly, then new wounds will open!
Maybe this was a stipulation of a trade from Rodgers. Drag it out all summer just for the drama
It's because they don't want to give up high picks then have him retire after this season.
Not since the last drama queen packers QB was considering retirement....
I agree
It’s entirely possible that both teams want to wait and see how the first 12 picks in the draft play out. Jets and Packers may end up swapping 13 & 15 as part of the trade.
I'll be the odd man out.  I don't *think* Rodgers puts you guys over the edge to a super bowl, and the worse the situation is for the packers, the happier I am.  Combine those two, and I hope some magic happens so y'all get a competent qb, and Rodgers retires halfway through the season after pissing off Love, and most of green bay.
Eh fuck him I hope they don't trade him so the Lions can sweep his ass again before he retires and the Packers get no draft picks for him
I know Rodgers is by far the best QB youve all had in some time but I'm curious, what do you expect his level of play to be at? You can maybe blame some of his play last year on injuries but he isn't a spring chicken anymore and I feel like injuries are just going to be common place for the foreseeable future.
Honestly is it just the Jamal Adams trade? There is no non afc east flair that goes out to their way to disparage the jets more than Seattle
> You're getting late career Peyton Manning.  The Jets would hate to get a QB putting up 5500 yards and 55 TD's...
Late career Manning put up the best statistical season of his career in his second season with the Broncos. Hell, in his third season he threw for 4,727 and 39/15. I’d gladly take that.
Oh ok bud 👍
Oh god that is funny
He and the remaining off-season moves will give the Jets a chance to win any playoff games and win 10-13 games. Not the preseason favorite but a team with a real chance to win the SB   I think even you can see that, and don’t see this as dissimilar to what Brady did to the Bucs
I expect him at the very least to play like he did last year, which would easily have us in the playoffs. Best case scenario the guy who has won 2 out of the last 3 MVPs recovers from his thumb injury and balls out with Garrett Wilson and Breece Hall.  And once you get to the playoffs anything can happen. Maybe even beat Peyton Manning and Tom Brady back to back weeks on the road with a QB named Mark Sanchez
I'm not saying it isn't possible. I just don't know if Rodgers will be as good as you need, and I don't trust him to not retire halfway through the season if he isn't getting what he wants.  It's also a matter of what I want to happen, not what I think will happen. Again, I'm happiest with the situation where the packers are most fucked.
I didn’t say he would put us over the top for the SB
Please actually read what I said, wrote, whatever
Y’all Larry Allen was a guard not a tackle

How tf does someone pick a QB that isn’t Brady? Brady’s prime lasted like 18 years…. Your team is set at that position for two decades by picking that man. What the hell is wrong with you
Draft?
My name is Taco and I’m drafting all kickers

Give me Joe Thomas for Tackle. Joe was the best of the best, and did it in an era of freak athletic pass rushers.

Disagree on your QB, RB and WR right off the bat. DE wrong too.  Should be:  QB - Brady (2007 still best QB year ever)  RB: Ladanian Tomlinson (Sanders made way too many negative runs. Can't have those drive killers).  WR: Rice   DE: Reggie White
Listing anyone besides Munoz at OT is silly and incorrect
QB - Peyton Manning. Manning may not have been the most physically talented QB, but his personality, work ethic, and attention to detail guaranteed he would succeed no matter what team he went to.  RB - Jim Brown  WR - Calvin Johnson. Randy Moss was just as talented, but too inconsistent. His effort noticeably waned for certain plays, or even entire games.  TE - Tony Gonzalez  OT - Anthony Munoz. Mike Brown remembered when he and his father Paul Brown watched Munoz in his final Rose Bowl. They just sat and laughed at how big and how good he was.   OG - Larry Allen. Allen's prime didn't last quite as long as some others. His legs faded, and it became tougher for him to hit a moving target. But in his prime, he was a monster.  C - Dwight Stephenson. Lightning fast and dominant.  DE - Deacon Jones. Had a greater peak than Reggie Whte, though White had a longer peak. 115.5 sacks in a six year period.  DT - Aaron Donald  Rushbacker - Lawrence Taylor  OLB - Bobby Bell  MLB - Dick Butkus  CB - Deion Sanders  S - Ed Reed
QB: Mahomes RB: Brown WR: Rice TE: Gronk OT: Munoz G: Upshaw C: Otto DE: White DT: Donald LB: Taylor CB: Sanders S: Reed
It's called MUT
I’m just a fan of all of the love Steve Tasker is getting in this thread.
T, G, C - Bruce Matthews
Arden Key (every position)
Guessing OP plays MUT lol
What about kelce at tight end and I know it's a fading position but I didn't see anyone mentioning a fullback
Tackle - Larry Allen? Wtf?
Not a single Buccaneer even though that 99-04ish defense was the best ever, to some… Still respect the list though  Edit Gronk counts but not really
Totally bias I’m taking 2015 cam newton
Gimme Hall at returner
WR Moss for sure   QB Marino
Bo Jackson at rb all day
QB- ma homie   Rb- Bo Jackson   Fb- mike altitty   Wr- rice   Wr- moss   Te- Tony g   MLB- mr Lewis   FS- Dawkins or ed Reed   SS- Polamalu.   Only positions I care enough about to put rn
Mahomes over Brady is some real recent bias lmao. And Johnson over Rice? What???
No one should be listing him at tackle anyway because Munoz is the answer
Technically he was both. But primarily guard, yes.
He played 4 of the 5 offensive line positions and was an All-Pro at least once with 3 of them.
the minister of defense is the GOAT i will ignore any arguments to the contrary
The best player on the all-time best defense ('91 Eagles).
I think he is. White's longevity is insane and for some reason it's ignored. Like LT probably had a better peak, largely because there was a difference between a 3-4 OLB and a 4-3 DE back then but White played for so much longer.
This was a coin toss for me I barely gave Watt the edge do to batted passes and his 2012 and 2014 seasons.
I was looking for Reggie white , Bruce smith , Derrick Thomas
Prime JJ was getting 20 sacks and catching 2 TDs while swatting everything. I don't think anything beats Prime JJ. White's career>JJ's
Reed vs Lott was one of the toughest debates for me I barely gave Lott the edge do to how hard he hit For Munoz vs Allen. There no question Munoz was better but when I thought of tackle and talent those videos of Allen squating Hundreds of pounds and running down interceptions popped into my head
Prime Gates over prime Gronk is a bit if a wild choice, rest of these I agree
> Special Teamer - Kassim Osgood  Oh fuck, this guy knows his shit.
I’d draft Bob Dylan at QB too simply because he’d come up with the greatest, most confusing audibles of all time
Not even a homer take.  Reggie was a singular talent.
Only one of the lists posted has Jerry Rice at WR, I can only conclude its a bunch of 15 year Olds...
Because they once saw Mahomes run around for seven seconds and launch a ball though the uprights on SportsCenter.
Agreed. It’s Brady for me all day
Recency bias
Yeah, but if we take single game peaks, Manning and Brees have each had a seven touchdown game, Brady's best was 6.  Actually Foles managed 7 once too.
I love Mahomes and wouldn't ever ask/dream of anything else at QB, but I think even he would acknowledge it should be Brady instead of him at this point in time.  If the dude plays another 15 years and gets 4 more rings then sure.
Because Mahomes is just straight up a better QB. Give Mahomes those stacked Pats defence and Mahomes would legit win 10 SBs in a row
Some people have enough ethics to not want an asterisks next to their superbowl wins.
The thought process is your not taking their full career rather your just drafting a player based on prime and talent. Based on that you won’t know if Brady plays that long. And I ended up putting him behind because in a theoretical draft mainly do to athleticism he wouldn’t perform great in this theoretical combine and I think it would hurt him
Yeah wait a minute, Mahomes isn’t ridiculous but you have to pick Brady 10/10 times lol
Agreed. Mahomes is obviously great, but too many people already seem to think he’s the goat. Frankly, I’d be stupefied if Mahomes had a better career than Brady.
It can be argued other qbs are more talented than him and Brady and billicheck Co benefited from each other. I think other acceptable qbs include Montana, young, Marino, rodgers, manning. Elway.
I do not understand how I scrolled this far down to find Jerry Fucking Rice
Manning 2004 or Marino 1984 clears Brady 2007 easily. Brady’s the GOAT but those seasons were insane.
LT Is not better than Barry Sanders bruh
I’d probably go Faulk over LT otherwise your list is good.
I was debating on having Brady but I decided his lack of mobility was too much of a negative for him to be considered as the best most talented theoretical prospect  LT over Barry Sanders isn’t something I disagree with RB to me was the hardest to pick I went with Barry do to elite agility but LT would be good do to his duel threat ability  I had Johnson over Rice in a tight race only because I think Johnson would be considered a better prospect do to his freak nature  Then I had Watt over White in another close one because of Watts ability to bat passes and his 2012 and 2014 seasons however this one feels like a coin toss considering White was on pace for 27 sacks once
I can understand someone wanting to argue like Walter or Emmitt over Barry (I'd still disagree) but ***LT***?!
That was my thought as well.  Larry is a great dude...but don't think anyone outside of Cowboys homers would say this.  Maybe if it was just a bench press competition.
Or Ogden or Walter Jones
Nobody would be putting tackle Allen on their all-time team, even if he was really good in a season here or there.
He took over at RT his rookie year after Erik Williams tore knee ligaments in an auto accident. The play he's most remembered for is getting knocked to the ground by Reggie White's hump move.  He moved to guard the following year and made his first Pro Bowl. He spent one season at LT in the late 90's, but definitely spent the majority of his prime, and career, at guard.
also he spent the first two years of his career in the USFL if he had played out his full career in the nfl he would hold the all time sack record by likly 30 or so sacks
Lmao flair
You don’t have to bat passes when you already sacked the quarterback. Reggie takes the cake.  BTW the man died from sleep apnea.
This man said batted balls when talking about a GOAT player lmao come on dawg
Players and prospects are still trying to figure out the "hump" move. Still the best edge move the game has seen.
Reed vs lott is absolutely a toss up, and you can't go wrong.  I only pick reed because I watched him play so much and the interviews with peyton talking about him (also a tossup for me between peyton and marino).
“How hard he hit” is poor rationale if you’re drafting them for todays NFL when half his hits are penalties. Reed’s ball skills were really in a league of their own. The fact he was also an above average punt returner and punt block specialist adds additional value purely as a football player.
Even Gates over Tony G, he is arguably the reason why TE's are playing the way they are now.
Tangled up in Blue 42
Calvin Johnson was an incredible talent, but he retired after 9 seasons because he felt like his body was starting to break down. In Rice's 10th, 11th, and 12th seasons he totaled 4,600 yards. I am convinced he was from a different planet.
“But did you see how he just flicked it under hand, he’s like a qb and a pitcher kid” lmao
I just literally don’t know how it could be different for someone. Even non pats fans have to put him there
Foles also beat Brady in the Super Bowl.  Foles > Brady it’s objective fact
Well Rodgers threw 6 in one half. That’s extrapolated to 12 in a game. Checkmate.
Brady is the GOAT and no one else comes close. He's like Babe Ruth, MJ, Messi, etc..
Bro the position cannot be played better than Brady played it
The fact that three people upvoted this clearly sarcastic post is scary
Moron
Prime Brady better than Prime Mahomes.
Na man, you are reaching
We know exactly how long Brady played. Wtf are you on? His prime was also damn near his entire career. It’s Brady hands down.  In 15 years we can reevaluate where Mahomes ends up, until then it Tom Fucking Brady.
If Brady never existed, Mahomes still isn’t the answer. I don’t think OP understands his own hypothetical, I think he means to ask best season ever. We have no idea how long PM’s prime is going to be yet so how can he be chosen
And people are still picking Larry Allen at tackle
They'd shut down the NFL if 1984 Marino played in 2023
Not easily at all. Those plus Rodgers 2011, Manning 2013, and Brady 2016 are the GOAT QB seasons.
especcialy when the negative runs that barry had were becasue his oline was fucking ass
If you said him for guard, sure. I’d probably say the same. And the fact he was able to play tackle at a Pro Bowl level is remarkable but he only did it for two seasons  Especially when OT has Munoz, one of the clearest answers out of any position besides WR and Rice
Or just Munoz, the correct answer
Nah the play he is most remembered for is making a tackle on an interception return.   https://youtu.be/DFcWMC9vkZg
I'm not gonna say Watt was better than White or OP isn't biased, but specifically on topic when talking about player's peak, Watt is at least in the conversation for DE and a defensible pick.  He was on that GOAT tier trajectory before injuries derailed his career, but those injuries don't matter for this topic.
See I feel like fans only hear that part of Jerry Rice but he was also a record breaking reciever early in his career in a much less friendly Era. He's just all around the best reciever in NFL history
Rice burned DB's in the Super Bowl as a 40+ year old Oakland Raider, while 35ish Tim Brown was on the other side of the field doing the same.  WR were built different back then.
F that chee-tah
Rodgers GOAT confirmed.
Brady needs to come back and win another one. Some in this thread have clearly already forgotten. 😂
How certain are you that it's sarcastic lol. I've seen people make more absurd statements about Mahomes and fully believe it
Have we seen prime Mahomes yet?
Mahomes' first 5 years as a starter are better than Brady's best 5 years period, let alone his best 5-year stretch. Mahomes is the leader in every per-game metric as well as every efficiency metric on the books outside of comp %, and he's still top-10 in that..  Brady's '07 is better than Mahomes' '18 or '22, but that's about it.
Chill out. You don’t own the dudes opinion. It’s not like he picked someone ridiculous. And he’s not the only one in here not picking Brady, so it’s obviously not unanimous. We’re are talking about *prime*. Mahomes 5-year run right now is on par with Brady’s best 5 years. To me, either answer is acceptable.
Yeah I agree. Mahomes is unreal for sure, and maybe I’m biased, but Prime Peyton is still above him
Brady 16 is nowhere near Manning 04 or Marino 84. Marino threw 48 TDs in the 80s. Manning Has the best single season TD percentage of anyone past the 80s with nearly 10%. A TD pass every 10 attempts
Of course a dolphins fan
Yes.
Thank you for acknowledging that prime Brady is better than Prime Mahomes. Some people in this post are struggling with that.
Mahomes also came into the league with 2 HOF players on offense, and the league is more passing friendly now. Arguing this is dumb there is too many variables.
Right, and Brady had a 28:2 TD:INT, best ratio of all time, and had the top PFF rating ever. They called his play basically mistake-free: https://www.pff.com/news/pro-how-patriots-qb-tom-brady-was-nearly-perfect-in-2016  He went 11-1 and went 3-0 in the playoffs, with an epic comeback against the LoB. He was damn near perfect in terms of catchable balls, deep throws, big time throws, all that.
An epic comeback against the LoB was 2014. THE epic comeback was against the Falcons that year.
TD-Int Ratio doesn’t mean a season is better than another. He missed 4 games where he could have had a shitty game and threw 2 to 3 picks.
I mean if you have Brady's 2016 in there, then surely Nick Foles' 2013 is right there with him, right?  |Year|Name|Cmp|Att|Cmp%|Yds|TD|TD%|Int|Int%|Rate|ANY/A| |:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |2013|Foles|203|317|64.0|2891|27|**8.5**|2|0.6|**119.2**|**9.18**| |2016|Brady|**291**|**432**|**67.4**|**3554**|**28**|6.5|2|**0.5**|112.2|8.81|  ---  How about we compromise and say that neither is in the conversation for *the* best season ever, considering neither were even the best QBs in their respective years.
Oh haha right, mixed up the epic comebacks. Thanks.
It’s the best TD:INT ever and one of the lowest interception rates in history. Marino and Manning threw more TDs, but they also threw eight and five times as many interceptions.   As for him having a bad game, the three extra games he played in the playoffs say otherwise. Meanwhile  Manning couldn’t even score in his playoff loss and Marino got beat by an underdog Patriots team.
Manning's was in 04 where you could make the most made the pro bowl with 28 TDs. Marino's was even earlier in 84, both when passing was not as strong as it was in 2016. They also matched their interceptions with more TDs.
Trey is from Minnesota and he plays in San Francisco, so I kinda doubt he just dropped by a throwing session in Ft Worth uninvited, lol.
The title makes it sound like Lance was being a  douchebag interrupting the session
Mahomes better be careful. We kind of have a thing for 49ers QB's.
There is absolutely no source for their claim that he “crashed” the session lol. I fucking hate sports reporting. I very highly doubt he just showed up.
>Chiefs in talks for Lance  -Florio (probably)
Why did I picture Trey Lance driving a golf cart around menacingly as Mahomes tries to throw passes
The audacity. The duplicity. The… I’m sure there’s another word that ends in ity that fits.   How dare he.
All Glory to the Hypnotoad!
Mahomes: (looks over shoulder) Oh fuck, who invited trey? Trey: hey guys mind if I throw around with you? Mahomes: Oh yeah buddy, the more the merrier.
Is he dressed like Mahomes as a joke lol
Andy is about to run a two man QB crew, y'all don't even know what the chef's cooking up
Apparently, Trey threw mahones to a WR, or so the story goes
I thought Purdy was the second coming of Jesus? I mean Montana?
Players tend to have more empathy then casual fans or reporters.   A big consensus among fans and media is "lance is a bust, what has he shown? Its purdys team"  Lance probably heard and asked if he could tag along with the best qb in the league.  Mahomes looks at it like A: my recievers get more reps. B: this kid was in a similar situation as me but when he took over he played in a monsoon game and then got injured. And then, the last pick in the draft played really good and everyones already burying this poor kid.   Its either that or they have the same publicist or something and they are just trying to create positive stories about lance
Lol Chiefs fans are so delusional. They think Mahomes is some sort of god and a guy like Trey Lance wouldn’t just show up and big dawg Patty just cuz he can.
I heard everytime Mahomes would go to throw, lance would yawn really loudly
That would be absolutely hilarious though. Trey Lance trying to big time Mahomes like some sort of 80’s bully movie.
It's that damn Lancel! He's so hot right now!
Nah Lance came and threw down for the sesh. He's not like that.
Maybe he was! I’m not saying he is a douchebag, but every Trey I’ve ever known sure was.
Yeah, unfortunately I read the the article and there is literally no information about Lance “crashing” Mahomes’ throwing session. Journalism is dead.
He made his entrance to Stone Cold's music over the loudspeakers.
On the other hand maybe Mahomes just really respects Henne and wants to follow in his footsteps as the vet backup
Trade him to you for Creed
Mahomes would look good in a 49ers jersey.
So it's time for the reverse now right? RIGHT?
BabyTRexArms SLAMS poor sports headline in internet ROW
I took it in a positive context. But now I see it as a negative context generating headlines
I think it’s just a weird use of the word, I don’t think it was meant to imply anything negative
49ers and Chiefs are swapping QBs? Shanahan and Mahomes?!?!?!
“just got off the phone with a source close to the chiefs, i got a text saying lance is in play.”   -josina tweet, upcoming.
He’s got to stop talking about Rodgers first!
Ive actually heard those rumors brought up this past week, but didnt put any stock into them because i cant believe theres any chance the 49ers are just giving up on Lance already which is what it'd take for the Chiefs to send a 7th rounder for him because that would be the highest theyd offer
you wanna know what, you got a problem with canada gooses then you got a problem with me.
Titty?
Unmitigated gall
The propensity...maybe
You thought that?
What's your point?
Even Jesus couldn't play with his arm in a sling.
Different sport but this reminds me of Marchand, Mackinnon, and Crosby training together in the offseason.
Maybe Mahomes invited him because he knows that Trey Lance will eventually make his way down the 49ers -> Chiefs QB pipeline.
People really think lance is a bust? The dude hasn't played nearly enough.
I gotta be honest, if Lance or any other player just busted their way in and were like "what's up nerds, you ready to learn how to play football?" they would instantaneously become my all-time favorite player, hands down.
 I saw Trey Lance at a grocery store in Orinda last week. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.
I wonder if KC can borrow one of San Francisco's extra quarterbacks to be our backup QB. We like taking Ex-49ers.
Accurate as fuck if your name is Trey fuck you
Maybe one day I can come in for an injured starter and lead a touchdown drive in the playoffs. A man can dream.  - Mahomes, probably.
Human Clay?  Weathered? My Own Prison?  Which album you want?  We might be able to work something out.
Don't you dare touch my tailgate protector
He'd make a solid backup for SAM FUCKIN DARNOLD
Majestic. Barrel-chested. The envies of all ornithologies.
Mitch that you?
That’s what I’ve been told by others.  Aka espn in December of 2022, amongst others.
God I hate all of them lol
Chiefs master plan.   Mahomes coming off his second superbowl win.   Andy "wonder if the niners would part with that qb they had planned to start"  Mahomes starts panicing. His friends tell him hes the best qb in the league.  Mahomes "they traded for elvis grbac. ELVIS FUCKING GRBAC!!"
Eli Apple just jumped on the first plane to Kansas.
I can also verify this story. I am the grocery store.
Years ago I first heard this story with Sam Bradford in it. I thought it was the truth and it ruined my image of Sammy Sleeves for a bit until I realized it was a copypasta lol.
Omg are we doing this again lmao no
Lmaooo I can’t tell if this is a shit post or not
Infetterence gets me every fucking time.
Ill got something for your mouth that will keep you saying “huh huh” 😭
Montana, Bono, Grbac, Smith... pure tradition at this point.
Somewhere Trey Anastasio is making sad guitar noises.
What if...?
Crosby is unhateable
He’s gonna be pissed when he figures out the camp is in Texas
Why would he fly to Kansas when the Chiefs play in Missouri?
I was the Milky Ways and I say you're wrong
Steve Blake for me. It's a gift that keeps giving. I would love to meet The Creator and buy them a frosty some day.
Gotta love Sammy sleeves
Same thing happened to me but with Rashod Hill randomly, who was just a backup swing tackle for years. It was so specific I thought it was true
It’s a real story.
Story older than you
I mean I only interacted with Anastasio once and I never even said a word to him but he was a massive douchebag. Soo checks out. I'm not gonna give too much info but I was working a venue phish plays annually and just walked by him and a couple suits who run the venue waaay pre show like 2pm when we are setting up stuff and he just scoffs and said something along the lines of make sure none of them talk to me or ask for shit.. and I shit you not I didn't know who he was til my boss talked to a few of us managers and let us know to stay away.   They put on a hell of a show though Ill give them that.   Plus I found a "the Great Went" (I think it was that one this is years ago now) poster at a Thrift shop and had it framed because I knew from working those shows that their merch sells out fast and then appreciates in value like a mofo sometimes.. Anyway, said poster was in my backseat overnight and my car got rammed and totaled while parked by a teenager texting and driving.   Insurance paid me in full value once I found it on a vintage poster site and forwarded the sales prices. So fuck it trey all is well.  edit to add the poster.   https://expressobeans.com/public/detail.php/120
Have you not heard of the city of Philadelphia?
You’re smoked; that man is **definitely** hateable.
Fuck Crosby and his golden child penguin privilege
He is absolutely hateable. Has plenty of dirty hits but no one cares because he was the NHL’s golden boy
And that the Chiefs are in Missouri
So that the plane can woosh right over your head.
He didn’t realize KCI has a new terminal and was trying to avoid the awful airport
I was the preventable electrical infetterence
MC ride for me
A story as old as stories.
I promise that he is universally despised by Flyers fans
No the Chiefs put other teams in misery
Darksydephil for me
That hardly counts, flyers fans hate everything, most of all the flyers.
As a red wings fan I don’t think I’ve met a hockey fan in Michigan who doesn’t hate Crosby.
I have NEVER been SO offended by something I 100% AGREE with!
Thats an insanely high success rate.  Golden is accurate.
Golden Tate is the only golden draft pick I can think of
The Dolphins have caused us to lose our golden pick!
Man. That list is pretty oddly great.
> = Pro Bowler ^ ^ = multiple pro bowls + = All Pro  I'm drunk, but wtf. Can you make this more better, I'm so confused.
They’re all studs let’s gooo Kwity
This is the best offseason content I’ve ever seen, OP. Kudos. I wish your team nothing but an absolute travesty of a season.
This is some good shit OP. I'm shocked at how many good players there are on the list.
Super excited for my great great grandchild to witness the greatest Mr Irrelevant ever in the year 2262
So you're telling me that there's a chance for a redemption arc for Quay?
Tyson Alualu was and is a good DT honestly surprised he never made a pro bowl
I remember thinking K'Lavon Chaisson was going to be great. No idea what the hell happened.
Lmaooooo dude made this just to shit on the Jaguars
Hebron Hooker!
oh damn I want the Texans to trade with the vikings
Man I miss BJ Raji.
As I scroll I was going to say we let the side down and then saw your blurb at the bottom. Cheers from the commercial break in the first round everyone!
First one going backwards is from 2000 is Rodney Holman in 1982 pick 82 who was a 3 time pro bowler and 3 time all pro in 1988-1990
So why is Fitzgerald not the golden pick for 2003
Taylor should have been pro bowl this year. He did better than Sewell
I miss Fuller
I'd be interested to see the hit rate aggregated across all drafts for picks 1-22.
Almost like most of them were drafted first half of the first round.
Marcus Golden erasure
Auden Tate
Golden Taint is one of my favorite fantasy football team names.
They almost had Derek Henry but had Harvey instead.
Russ wouldn’t agree
= = + and ^^ = ++ while ¥¥ is not, yes
If your pick is the last two digits of the year you’re picking a good player. Except for the glitter kitties.
I enjoyed the best AJ Color, just wish there was a few more options.
He's pretty good already, he just has to think before doing dumb shit
He can be added to the long list of off ball linebackers not worth their draft position but people ignore because they don’t like to hear about how useless the position is.
That shit Quay
Seems like he got injured.
Probably has something to do with being drafted in 2004, but don’t quote me on that.
https://www.arrowheadpride.com/2015/2/20/8072877/what-the-statistics-tell-us-about-the-draft-by-round   Historic Success Chart The numbers show us the following outline for finding consistent starters:   1st Round - OL (83%) LB (70%) TE (67%) DB (64%) QB (63%) WR (58%) RB (58%) DL (58%)   2nd Round - OL (70%) LB (55%) TE (50%) WR (49%) DB (46%) QB (27%) DL (26%) RB (25%)   The site doesn't distinguish top half of the first to bottom, but difference between first and second round success doesn't fall off a cliff either. The top likely has the most success, but there are still many years that's trash. 2012 had 4 busts (I use the term loosely. 2013 had 6 or 7 busts. Also, I don't remember most drafts, I just started in 2012 because of Andrew Luck (and I still miss him).   The little golden pick is hitting well above 80% right now
Au is the periodic symbol for gold so Auden Tate really is Golden Tate.
[Relevant](https://youtu.be/MCxajKYgtLg)
I thought about doing a best current "-sons" team   QB:Lamar jackson, watson, Wilson?   WR1: J. Jefferson  WR2: Allen Robinson, diontae Johnson, garrett wilson?   RB: Jeff Wilson, Rahmondre Stevenson, Brian Robinson, Antonio Gibson, c.paterson?  TE: Hockenson  K: Daniel Carlson, evan McPherson,  riley Patterson?
It’s not useless if they’re the general of the field. CJ Moseley, despite being a step below his prior physical self, is still worth more to the jets top tier defense than most players are. More often than not, it’s that off-ball LB that takes that position for better or worse
No, he was just never good.   Most of that draft was a fucking waste for the Jags. 90% of our fans would have drafted better than Dave Caldwell
His metric for what’s considered success leaves a lot to be desired.   “Started more than half their career games.”   I think this post does a much better job at providing more meaningful statistics.   https://www.dailynorseman.com/platform/amp/2022/4/26/23042105/nfl-draft-pick-bust-rate-remains-very-high
> The site doesn't distinguish top half of the first to bottom  I don't have any numbers to back it up but I have a suspicion this is important based on how teams leverage their trades with these picks.
So DL, one of the most important position groups, sees the biggest drop-off by far. RB will be too skewed by just too few going in the first, and they are typically always considered blue-chip.
Yes that's the joke
Mam, yall really just squandered some really talented players..
The same Jets defense that was the worst in the NFL in 2021?  Was he learning the art of general-ing then?
I'm high as fuck right okay?
But the same one that was one of the best in 2022? 💀
You can have the best general in the world and they still aren't going to win a war with toddlers.
Same and I was able to make the joke and understand it
Think you missed the point buddy.
Yeah, except for the fact that the general is actually the guy on the sidelines and this guy is just as effective in battle as the toddlers.
Not a relevant username
Cant miss a point when you didn’t make a valid one
The “valid” point was that he was on the Jets defense that was the worst in the NFL.  They didn’t get good until they added actually valuable players.  If he was the “more valuable piece” of the Jets defense than the pieces they added, they wouldn’t have sucked in 2021.  I can’t believe this needs to be explained to you.
It’s a team sport? Brandin Cooks is a great wide receiver but his teams offense is the worst in the league. You really thought C.J. Mosley could make a defense good by himself? That’s laughable. He’s still an amazing linebacker
What a nonsense comparison.  Brandon Cooks is what, the 30th best WR in the league at best?  And that may be generous.  Mosley is like a top 5 off ball linebacker LOL.  You had to pick a *Brandin Cooks* level player to find even a semblance of a bad offense with a WR 😂   And his position relies on the QB to be competent, what exactly is Mosley relying on?  Every other position on the defense?
in his five seasons, richie never had a single game where he caught 100+ yards receiving except for one random game in 2020 where he absolutely torched the packers for like 180 yards  that's the primary memory i have of him
soon we all have all of the giants receivers
> James becomes a target for Patrick Mahomes  So we're just assuming that Mahomes will be the Chiefs starting QB next year?
He’s very good at finding soft spots in zones to move the chains, probably takes over JuJu’s role in that regard, but he also had some drops in the worst moments ever. His hands we insane for the most part though, and he should never be allowed to return punts.
I'm Rich James bitch
57 catches for 569 yards and 4 TDs, but more importantly this was all done on a 46.17% snap share.  Great signing, especially if the financials look good.
Whatever the chiefs do, do not let him return punts especially if you are playing against the Seattle Seahawks. Other than that he’s a solid WR with good hands
We used to take QBs from 49ers, now that we got one of those, I guess we're making the Giants our WR farm!
Mahomes gonna turn all ex giants WRs into probowlers
Goodbye Justyn Watson?
Nice, was kinda hoping to see him back this year but at this point it was obvious we wouldn’t, glad to see him with a contender. Definitely a solid WR especially when you don’t need him to be a top target lol. Take good care of Richie!
I’ll always have a soft spot for Richie because he came in clutch so often this year for us (except for the Seahawks game)
Mike Kafka is a low key scout for the Chiefs
Good for Richie. He's carved out a very nice career for himself after coming out as an under-sized 7th round pick 5 years ago. He was pretty productive in NY so it'll be very interesting to see what a year with Mahomes can do for his play.
Until Mahomes, the Chiefs were the future home of SF QBs.  With Mahomes, they appear to be the future home of NYG WRs
Chiefs fans...be good to Richie. He will always have a place in my heart, as maybe the poster child for the Giants improbable season. He may not be elite, but he's elite to us.   Good luck Richie   (Don't have him return punts)
I loved him on the giants. Thought he was their shining star until hodgins started heating up.  This is a good signing for both sides. Wonder if he’s either aToney insurance or they plan on using one of them on the outside more
God the Chiefs are ran so well, Mahomes is going to put up 5k passing yards throwing to scrubs and Travis Kelce while the Bengals pay Jamar Chase and Tee Higgins a combined 50+ million with holes all over the rest of the roster.
So 3 of his TD’s came in garbage time, but Richie was a great situational receiver. when it mattered he made some clutch plays. See the Commanders game in week 15.
This is a great signing for them given how they used the platoon approach last year
Fuck yo couch
Richie is more reliable than Toney.  Toney will have some flashes but go quiet or land on IR for weeks at a time. Richie is a reliable chain mover who has a knack for converting 3rd and 10+ situations.
First McKinnon goes and now James. I know who I’m grabbing deep in the draft for fantasy football this year. Chiefs have a way of unlocking former 49ers that is very poignant.
Cant wait to see how much money we made him.
Ladies and Gentlemen, we got him
Oh no. This is great for KC.
Great pick up
Bitch
Future all pro
Chiefs 🤝 Florida Boys
Richie James will be everything we wanted Kadarius to be….or better yet now we have two Kadarius’s……let’s fucking go!!!!
Not what I was looking for Veach
Hell probably move to HB
Breakout season? That’s a stretch.
James is a decent return man. Outside of that, he’s a fringe player that wouldn’t make the roster on most teams.
Damn he was good for the g men but I guess they already have Campbell and Robinson should be back at some point too.
Interesting
It's Richie James, bitch!
Another capable slot guy in a wide receiver room filled with capable slot guys..
Seahawks legend Richie James, damn. Guy was the biggest factor for us against the giants this year.
I think that was the Nick Mullens game? I think we won, but Richie James still scares me lol
I'm rich James bitch!
Wait so he’s toney?
We had an unbelievable amount of injuries/COVID contacts that game, even by our standard
He was good for the Giants last year if you look beyond the stat sheet.
For me his backflips on kneel downs to end games.
I love him cause he was on pace to potentially break the ncaa catch record before getting hurt
I like how you say he’s hand a single game of over 100 yards and then proceed to mention a game where he has over 100 yards lol
Patrick Mahomes will make Kenny Golladay look like Kelvin Benjamin
OBJ ain't happenin
New Jersey West
The second they become remotely decent the giants don't want them anymore.
New Jersey West
That’s… not good for you
Right crazy to think anyone believes Shane buchele won't get the starting job
The Buchele disrespect is sickening.
Somebody has to hold it down til the rookie phenom Richardson is ready
>  he should never be allowed to return punts  Was hopeful he was a Special teams ace, quick lived dream.
> He’s very good at finding soft spots in zones to move the chains  Pulling the numbers, he averaged 4.1 receptions and 1.9 first downs in games in which he was targeted at least once last season.  Edit: I made that specification because he took snaps in 3 games in which he had 0 recorded targets, so eliminated those games.
As a Seattle fan who was at the game against the Giants last year . . . I get that (re: punts).
James fumbled two returns against the Seahawks.  He caught 80something% of all catches, which put him in the top 3 of all eligible WRs if I remember correctly.  One bad game tainted his image, but he is a solid depth piece and will do wonders with Mahomes and Reid
He muffed the first Chiefs punt of Superbowl 54, but was able to recover it.
Mr. Binged Cocaine
Damn that’s good
DARKNESSES
I’m surprised his snap share wasn’t higher, by mid season we had a total of 4 receivers that could play football and one of them was Kenny Golladay
I'm really licking my chops at the jump in catch % to 81%. Last year showed how good just having a 5 deep rotation of guys who can reliably run routes and not have the dropsies can be with Mahomes around. So if he can reproduce his last year as WR4/5 I'd be happy with that production.
Don't worry, we already have superstar punt returner Skyy Moore.
I would assume like in the Superbowl, Toney would be handling punt returns. But I guess Toney maybe be out 50% of games so someone else would have to pick up the slack in those games.
He returned kicks and punts for multiple seasons with us and I can’t remember a single time he broke one lol
TBF he was also on the 49ers
If it means beating giants rivals in the superbowl I’m down
What's Plaxico doing these days
Doubt it, they bring Watson back maybe and/or hope Justyn Ross heals up & makes the team.
I suppose there's a chance we sign Justyn back and just don't draft any WRs this year, except maybe a developmental guy like Haselwood or Iosivas.
James was a niners WR too 😂
This guy used to be a 49er too funny enough
It helps that Kelce is criminally underpaid. He should be making double what he's currently being paid.
Oh no they're giving market value to two players that are worth every penny, it's a shame there's not ~175M of cap to allocate elsewhere
To be fair, we never really managed to unlock Steve Bono or Elvis Grbac.
And Giants apparently lol
The minimum
We are little low on bodies at the WR position right now.  This guy is probably just depth with some returning chops.
We’re pretty stacked at the “average slot WR” position. Wish Ritchie the best of luck just don’t let him return punts.
K
yah it was definitely mullens and you guys still won by a couple touchdowns
Adams had like nearly 200 receiving yards that game; it was so frustrating to watch. We doubled him half the time, but it didn't matter.
they're really similar in terms of build but toney is a lot more talented. big reason why toney went first round and james went in the 7th, i think  james is a good athlete though. he'll probably do well for the chiefs, reid will get him open and get him the ball in space
His mama still calls him Anthoney.
So he basically became the last man standing? That dude must have started the season as WR9 considering the amount of injuries y'all seem to get lucky with.
He definitely got better towards the end of the season but he also single-handedly lost us the Seahawks game with his returns (although neither offense got going that game period)
Even Mahomes couldn't make Kelvin Benjamin decent when we had him.
Mahomes and Golladay KC BBQ tour incoming
I read this in Paul Mooneys voice for some reason
Fat?
Not should it have ever been speculated
Oh, like Isaiah Hodgins?
Toney was oft injured and unreliable (he is with KC too until otherwise; most games he only played 5-20 snaps). James reportedly wanted more than a VSB deal so I'm curious how the contract lays out. He's okay, primarily a depth piece in the slot and punt returner.   Giants did sign Parris Campbell to a deal and has more ability to do damage across other receiver spots. Very interesting to see what Kafka and Daboll can make with his speed.
Or baffles me you haven’t signed a free agent qb yet, bad management!
What if Elvis wants to make a comeback? Way better than mahomes.
Buchele is on a rookie deal, that's what you need to win a super bowl
We’ve never seen Buchele play in a regular season game, maybe he’s the next Patrick Mahomes?
Those unfortunate fumbles aside, he's okay at running 6 yards and getting tackled by the first gunner.
He had one game where he fumbled the ball twice on punt returns and we lost, other than that game he was decent returning throughout the year
I am a big critic on our PR team. Skyy Moore should never see the backfield but I will give him credit that he got better form and overall stopped looking like johnny Knoxville catching a punt. I am still scared to see who we put back there this year cuz it probably won't be toney and will be whatever rookie wr we draft.
Mr. Batters Couches
So 3 WRs.
Wait...you can have a receiving corp that doesn't have high drop rates and can be reliable?  Someone get McDermott and Beane on the phone right now
Kadarius toney slander
His drops were so disheartening last season
I swear to god, he should never be allowed out there again.
Bold of you to assume Toney plays more than 3 games
2018 against the Seahawks, only reason I remember is helped end their payoff hopes.
I feel like the Chiefs and 49ers have the most weird intertwined relationship. Like we always take your leftover players and y’all even take ours and it goes back decades.
Wow haha, of course.
Still remember drafting him. Was pretty stoked for him in the 7th. Looks like it was a good call. Glad to see him making his money.
The rest of the AFC is eternally in the Giants' debt for keeping you-know-who from 18-0. It's the least we can do.
I’m all for it too
Cheddar Bob plax 🤣
I don't understand the Justyn Ross hype and hope our from office isn't banking on him. (It doesn't seem like they are) The likelihood that he even see the field is low. His career trajectory is likely headed for car salesman in Clemson, SC.  If I'm wrong that's fantastic, but I remember the hype for Weston Dressler, and this feels like that on bath salts.
I don’t think there’s any way they come out of day 2 without a receiver
So listen maybe mind your own business
He’s also getting endorsements from everywhere. If I had to guess, he will take whatever it takes to stay with Mahomes
I kinda hope we give him just a massive fully guaranteed one year deal in his last season with the team as a thank you for out producing his contract for so many years
125m after you give Burrow his 50 million a year, all that money put into 3 players is sure going to help that patchwork O line that makes their passing game irrelevant in the playoffs anyways. Remember how Andrew Lucks career played out?
That’s a two for one for Reid
He was working hard keeping up with Richie James
He'll play more snaps with Toney nursing hammy injuries.
I can't not read that as Ant Honey.
He was probably WR5 from memory. Our missing players were at pretty much every position in that game though, got to the point where you could only laugh
Yeah, pretty sure he was the de facto WR1 that game because everyone ahead of him was out.
He wasn’t only man to be blamed for the Seahawks game although he played a role in the loss
Kelvin went to KC? I guess I missed that one.
["White people love Wayne Brady because he makes Bryan Gumble look like Malcom X."](https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkx_ARO1wfYBtdKUfoCJ7zKEkWmwK3f1g_V)
No a cheap 1 year deal to build his value back would’ve been nice.
Right how did we not take jimmy g off your guys hands? Where is the chief of ol that gets their starting qbs from the niners. Smh fire veach
Why sign one when we could pick a guy like Purdy, big brain time
Ya know I think blackledge is finally ready to be a starting QB in NFL
Was that the game he had -4pts in fantasy?
Happened to skyy too I think
Did he muff the catch or fumble on the return?
He said "could" play not "can currently" play
The funniest part is we were a top 10 team in drops too so Im not sure what he meant.
> Wait...you can have a receiving corp that doesn't have high drop rates and can be reliable  Not if they keep signing our receivers.
It's a joke because Skyy Moore fumbled like 17 punts last season.
I mean he’s fine situationally ig. The AFCCG showed us that
I mean he helped us setup the game winning FG against the Bengals.  Cut a rookie who was not a PR until this year some slack.
I’ll never forgive the Chiefs for taking Elvis Grbac.  Or Steve Bono.  Or Alex Smith.  Hell, y’all even took that scrub Joe Montana.
I don't think anyone is *banking* on Justyn Ross but he posted some videos of him running routes the other day and he looks pretty good. Obviously a long way to go before you're actually playing on Sundays, but still encouraging.
No idea what needs the chiefs have...but maybe they consider Toney and Moore enough and skip a high WR pick
You're probably right.  Just saying we might live in a universe where that doesn't happen.
Gronk and Brady route
This is so incredibly over simplified. There's plenty of ways to work around building a winning roster - above all else, continue to draft and develop well, which is where the cap savings will go for a team paying a QB his money.  Orlando Brown getting a front loaded contract, while Joe and Joe are cheap, was a masterful move. They've also got plenty of talented vets on defense for bargain deals. Just because they spend lots of money on two guys won't suddenly prevent them from finding other productive OL lol.   Luck's career flopped because he was so good that he carried a shit roster into the playoffs yearly and Grigson was a terrible GM. Apples and oranges.
In what world was the Bengals passing game irrelevant last year?
I remember when Chiefs traded for Toney and people were like "he has never even scored a touchdown in the NFL" two games later he scores his 1st touchdown lol
Yall still salty about Toney eh.   Look on the bright side. Giants turned that pick into an aging, injury prone TE with a big cap hit. Ironic?
He was either 5 or 6. Really we only signed him as a returner
Yeah in 2018 for like half the year.
You guys had a massive amount of attempts though  Bills had 1 more drop than the Chiefs in over 100 less passing attempts  When you throw almost 700 passes you are bound to have tons
Didn’t Patrick have like 70 attempts just in that titans game this past season.
But not the most important one (still hope to God he doesn't return punts)
It was only like 12 cmon man
I think he muffed 4 and lost 3.  He wasn't a PR in college so the lack of in game experience was a problem.  He was 4th string PR in AFC championship game and was forced into it due to injuries.  Made two damn good returns that helped us win the game.
We were waiting for just the right moment to actually draft and develop a QB. We are patient.
Yeah, that reminds me of the videos we used to get back in the day before the NBA draft of some Eastern Europe big man making post moves against a chair.
I think that would require quite a bit of projection between the two of them and then health.
Man I don’t know how they can trust a guy that has never gotten through 3 games in a row healthy and a guy they relegated to a gadget role to be the top 2 receivers on the team next year.
If that's our plan I'm disappointed in the FO
The similarities are spot on. And I know they’ve done camps together so I’d bet they’ve talked a lot
And not just a front loaded contract for OBJ, an arguable steal of a contract for him. We offered way more APY the year before. He's not a top 5 LT, but he definitely got less than I would have ever imagined.
The Chiefs have a mediocre defense and sacked Burrow 5 times in the AFC Championship game. Hit him 12 times.  We can't cover Chase at all, but it turns out that's OK if you don't give Burrow time to throw.
Now if he could only stay healthy, because he has had some flashes of greatness.
I assume Reid had to pull him aside and say "Listen, there are things more important than food".
It's coming back to me now. I remember how massive he was stretching out for a catch around the sideline.  I really don't mean to be mean but I can't engender of he caught it or not. I honest to God just remember the difference in mass between him and the DB  I do hope the homie is well
Yeah, his production really fell flat, like a pancake.
I'm not sure if he was ever active on game days
It was 3 games, with only 2 catches
As if the Bills didn’t? Mahomes threw 648 vs Allen’s 567. A difference of 81 passes. Bills fans love adding extras to make you guys sound like victims lol
We put him is a shitty spot, asking him to do that when he had never returned punts in college or high school.   I think he'll be fine in year 2.
And the other team only scored on like 100% of them
Tyreek Hill was a gadget guy his rookie year ya know.  It's common in Andy Reid offense.  Skyy will be given more opportunities in year 2.
it was barely ok lol we won off of a penalty, the fact they kept their dc should have teams worried but at least they lost their safety’s
Reid has never uttered that sentence.
Reid: I know how you feel, but you got to put the cheeseburger down
“there will be other meals!”
Or a squashed Popeye’s biscuit.
Okay a few things here. 81 attempts is literally a 2 game difference in attempts...that's a shit ton. And the Bills ALSO throw the ball a ton...so that's even crazier  Second...the Bills have moved on from 3 of their 5 receivers...so it was a huge problem this season  Edit: Originally I said 3 of their 5...no actually they have moved on from 5 of their 7 receivers. I forgot we picked up John Brown and Beasley out of the retirement home because of injuries
Well, That’s what people do all the time
I just don't see any reason it needs to be him.
I'm definitely not saying we dominated that game. I'm saying the only reason we were in it was because they didn't have an o-line.
*hand that cheeseburger to me.
Gotta train kelvin Kung fu panda style
Indy absolutely made the right choice. Peyton was already getting older, there were questions around how he would recover from his neck injury. And Luck was widely seen as the best QB prospect *SINCE* Peyton Manning. I don't think people remember, Luck was a damn near perfect draft prospect. He was as close to a sure thing as you can get. Yeah, things didn't go the way Indy wanted it too, but I think they made the right choice at the time.
With that offensive line they had Manning may not have made it another season.
Lets be honest Ryan Grigson was going to screw it up either way
Luck was 100% the right call. Peyton doesn’t make it more than a season behind some of those OLs and even if Peyton was a better QB, the Colts were not in a position to compete in the AFC anyways.
No one knew that Manning was going to be able to come back from the neck surgeries, and if it wasn't for the Broncos having the absolute prime of Von Millers career, those teams would have ended up ringless.
I wonder what they could have gotten in a trade for #1 overall. Washington traded up to #2 for #6, #39, and two future firsts
If they knew the outcome and that Peyton still had a few elite years left and Luck was going to retire before 30 I think you'd have to keep Peyton. In that situation I don't think you take Kuechly though, you trade down.
Even ignoring the few years of success the Broncos had with Peyton, I think the right move for the Colts was moving on and going with Luck.  They were a rebuilding team and got themselves a really damn good QB that they *could* have had for 10+ years.  The problem is Grigson gave Luck an OL full of traffic cones, something that probably would have happened if Manning was there and Manning would have been killed and probably forced into retirement earlier.
If they had a crystal ball and knew they’d only get a couple more years of Luck…yeah it probably would’ve made sense to ransom that pick.  Like how sure everyone was about him would’ve been a haul of players and picks to help plus up the last couple years of Peyton’s career.
If they surrounded luck with better players he might not have retired early. He carried those Indy teams with below average talent. Give luck a better team throughout his career and he might have won a Super Bowl.
With what we know now it's obviously trading the pick for a haul and building with Manning. But the Luck thing is the definition of hindsight and unpredictable. But three firsts would have gone a long way and Manning was elite that following year.
Luck retiring is the only thing that makes this a question.  But in hindsight they could have gotten a ridiculous haul for that pick and 4 more years of mvp qb play from manning.  They might have gotten another championship.  But they made the right call at the time.  Luck was a generational prospect.
Manning was done after two years.  They made the right call.
With the benefit of hindsight, they obviously should have kept Manning. Luck was never even remotely close to as good as Manning, and his early retirement make his value even lower in hindsight.  With the army of draft picks they would have gotten for Luck they would have very likely built a contender just as good or better than what the Broncos ended up doing.
Luck all day. Even knowing he retires early.
Would obviously be the ladder seeing how Peyton was still a top QB in the league and went to the AFC Championships and 1 Superbowl with the Broncos
In hindsight obviously keeping Manning was the move.   But really it doesn’t matter because Grigson was going to fuck the Colts sideways no matter who they had at QB. That dude might have been the worse GM of all time and I say that fully acknowledging BoB is a close 2nd.
Trade the pick to Washington for what they gave up for the 2nd plus God knows what else they would have parted with maybe Trent Williams?   Would have been interesting to see Luck in Washingotn with Shanahan.   Manning with some oline improvement trade the picks for win now players or build the roster. I think 80% of manning would have been super bowl contending with the capital they could have gotten. Also, the what ifs for Luck and RG3 had they went elsewhere is interesting.
I would have tried to trade Manning and get something out of it
Rebuilding with luck. There are no guarantees, but a prospect like that gives you maybe the best chance in all of sports at success.
In my opinion, Luck was such a sure thing, for the Colts this may have been the worst case scenario to play out. The man’s floor of potential was still 51 wins over 5 healthy seasons out of six. Most teams during that time would kill for 10 wins a year 5/6 seasons. His career will always be a what if? But the what did was still successful, and no question the right call by the colts. I hope in time his actual play doesn’t get forgotten.
Some perspective because hindsight is 20/20: we had no idea at the time if Manning was going to be able to throw again. There were a lot of whispers leaking that he had a noodle arm post-surgery. The drafting had also become really poor with Bill Polian ceding most control to his son Chris. The team was really old and so many high draft picks had been complete whiffs in the years leading up to 2012. Tony Ugoh, Donald Brown, Mike Pollack, Jerry Hughes, etc.   We'd be talking about a completely different Luck career if Irsay didn't make a knee-jerk overcorrection with the Grigson/Pagano hirings. People wondered why Telesco didn't get promoted to the GM job. And Pagano was a head-scratcher at the time. Luck was arguably a top 5 QB with a shaky defensive minded coach and maybe the worst drafting GM I've ever seen in 25+ years as an NFL fan. You can't knock the move on talent alone. The mistake was 100% in the coaching and GM hires thar followed Manning's release.
The biggest hindsight the Colts would have done is not hire Grigson. The only GM more hated than him or at least comparable is Dave Gettleman.
Peyton played well for 2-3 years. Was a shell by 2015 when they won. Luck was awesome and carried some very shitty Indy teams. Even went into Denver and beat Peyton in the playoffs in 2014
I mean, I think it was a great choice!  But really, I do think it was smart. Luck was seen as a sure thing, and he was great. You have to take that chance on young quarterback. There’s no guarantee Peyton was going to do what he did in Denver. And how often is a team drafting number one overall with a such a sure pick as Andrew luck?
The only argument for the Colts made the wrong choice is in hindsight.  Even then, the Broncos had a damn good offense with an at least average OL, the Grigson Colts could only dream of constructing as good of a roster
I loved the choice.   10/10 would recommend again.
One major factor in the decision that people tend to forget is the massive contract and bonus that was due Manning. If the Colts kept Manning, they would had to gut the roster even more than they did, and at the time they didn't even know if he could play. That contract and Luck sitting there to draft made it an easy choice.
Should’ve signed 15 year old Lamar Jackson
If we had a semi-competent GM for the Luck years he might still be playing
Luck did seem to be the rare case where there wasn’t even (or didn’t seem to be) any controversy surrounding whether or not a QB was worth the number one pick.  I don’t know if we’ve seen such consensus since.  No one even questioned the guy.  It was like when Jordan came back to the Bulls, everyone just kind of knew who was winning it all in ‘96, the season was just a formality.  At least that’s how it looked through my eyes as a child.
This is unpopular but I've always disagreed. It's very likely that Peyton Manning was going to be the best qb the Colts will ever have, at least in our lifetime.      I would much rather have a few more years with Manning than a top qb prospect like Luck. For Luck to be worth it, he would have had to become a first ballot hall of famerand that's a big ask no matter how good of a prospect he was.      My logic was years from now when it's all said and done you're going to wish you could watch Peyton one last time. So I'd rather have a few more years with Peyton than an entire career with luck.      Obviously to a way lesser extent this is why I completely agreed with the Patriots sticking with Brady than Jimmy G. Much rather have 2 more years (lol at my dumbass for only thinking he had a couple years left) of the best qb of all time than 10+ with Jimmy. Plus for the Colts, they would have gotten such a huge haul for that number 1 pick.
Horrendous OL class too.
Manning also had to learn how to throw a football again and until at least 2015 (and who knows if it is still the case) had no feeling in the finger tips of his throwing hand. There were serious questions about his health and longevity in 2012.   The Colts were the only team who had to make a choice between a potentially-compromised Manning and the best quarterback prospect in a decade in Andrew Luck.
Manning had one of the fastest releases in NFL history and his bread and butter was adjustments. It would have been noticeable but not nearly as dramatic as you're imagining.
Also didn’t do Luck any favors…
Accurate
Fuck Ryan Grigson.
> *In Retrospective*
Even if they knew he’d come back and play for 4 more years I’d say they still should have taken a QB like Luck
If the Rams were staying out and Indy wanted to trade probably about the same. Griffin was a highly regarded prospect as well and there is only so much a team can give up
The reason why I've always disagreed is because Manning is likely going to be the best qb they will ever have. I d much rather have a few more years with him than Luck for 10+.      Now that Elway is all said and done. Would you rather have Elway for a few more years or a qb like lets say Big Ben who's likely a hall of famer. Now obviously Luck could have been a lot better than Ben but there's still an unknown factor despite how good of a prospect he was. If I'm a Broncos fan, I'd easily take Elway for a few more years.
If anyone in 2012 said that Ryan Tannehill would have the best career out of himself, RGIII, and Andrew Luck people would think they were dumb. It’s crazy how things end up sometimes.
I will never buy this story. If you listen to his interviews his whole career it's clear he has passions outside of football like architecture in reading. It's all he ever wanted to talk about in interviews. His bookclub was a thing. I truly believe he retired at a much younger age no matter where he was.  Also his hit and sack numbers are way lower than alot of other QBs at that time anyway. Only once was he ever top 5 in sacks.
Trevor is the closest there has been since
It was horrendous at the top but if they traded down and got a RG3 style haul then there were some good options later in the first round.   Actually let's see who they could have gotten if they had Washington's picks in the 1st all 3 years:  2012 - Riley Reiff, David DeCastro, Kevin Zeitler  2013 - Chance Warmack, DJ Fluker, Justin Pugh, Kyle Long, Travis Frederick (though he was thought to be a huge reach)  2014 - Greg Robinson, Jake Matthews, Taylor Lewan, Zack Martin, Ja'Wuan James  Overall a few guys who were either busts or just okay, but if they focused on building Manning's line back up then they definitely could have gotten some help.
At least that class had QBs. We had to take Fischer first overall in 13 because the entire top of the draft was awful. Geno Smith was the first QB taken that year. In the second round. And our fan base wanted him 1st overall because we were on the rebound from Cassel.   CORRECTION- EJ Manuel was taken halfway through the first. Bet you forgot he existed.
> and his bread and butter was adjustments.       This is what I say when people discredit his second super bowl. Obviously he didn't play well but people make it seem like any qb would have won with that defense. He was still the smartest qb in the league and knew when to audible, knew how to adjust protection, and had great pocket awareness.      Their games against the Raiders that year is pretty telling at the difference he makes. Against Manning, the Broncos win a close defensive battle. Against Brock they held us to negative yards in the first half and we still won because Mack sacked him 5 times in one half, one being for a safety. I love Mack, but 0 chance he does that against Manning.
In that case, go f-...  Nah, I would have still gone with Luck. Harbaugh was allowing him to be the offensive coordinator in college. We can now all say what a shame but the colts stayed relevant for a bit longer than the broncos.
In retrospect*
🤦‍♂️ I just went to look at Andrew Luck vs RG3 vs someone like TLaws draft profile and the [bleacher report article](https://syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/905169-andrew-luck-is-the-best-nfl-prospect-ever.amp.html) starts with a Dashboard Confessional lyric.
And none would hold a candle to Kirk Cousins
Best career I guess but Luck is still the best QB of that draft class even if he retired really early
I wonder what sort of reaction you'd get if you told someone in 2012 that the QB class that year would be surprisingly stacked
he may not have been leading the lead in sacks but he did suffer form a lot of injuries, who knows whether more O-Line help would've genuinely reduced those injuries but I definitely think he would've played for longer if not for those injuries
That's absolutely not true.  Per NFL research, most QB hits taken since 2012:   Luck: 375 Tannehill: 364 Matt Ryan: 354 Russell Wilson: 349  This was in 2016.  You're full of shit.
Yeah. I remember those YouTube videos of his book club too back then.
Burrows and Lawrence
Problem is Mannings arm was shot after 2013. So you could've gotten a haul, but would those guys be ready to contribute fast enough to offset Mannings rapid decline in arm strength? Plus keep him healthy in the meantime?
I wish I forgot he existed
In retrocede*
Dude, B/R in the early 10s was amazing. It was fun sports stuff — I remember they had a “joke” 2025 mock draft or something and had a top 10 of “Speedy Sam”, “that big kid on the playground who you think got held back”, “the girl who can throw the ball further than all the boys so they all hate her”, etc, just silly stuff.   Now, it’s trash.
Tannehill has won twice as many playoff games though…
But with none of the first rounders.
True but even then his biggest reoccurring injury came from snowboarding. No one is saying the line was good enough. But people ignore all the factors beyond the bad oline. And the snowboarding injury still occurs which was the one that kept reappearing.
>but I definitely think he would've played for longer if not for those injuries  He's pretty openly talked about the constant injury rehab being a big part of why he retired, so I think that's a pretty safe bet.
I think it's safe to say a lot of those injuries were due to his style of play though. He was insanely gutsy and willing to take a hit to extend the play.
Now do the sack data.
Burrow had “is he a one hit wonder?” Questions around him, that were definitely valid since he was seen as a 4th round pick before he went insane his senior year. Lawrence is a better comparison for Luck.
He had a leg injury in the second half of 2014 and he basically lost all arm strength from that point on. Look at his splits from the first half of 2014 to the second. He was washed by the time they got embarrassed by the Colts.
In [retrograde](http://i.imgur.com/93XJSNh.png)\*
Wins being a QB stat is never going to die is it?
I think the main factor people ignore is that he’s a different dude and playing the game wasn’t as important to him as other things in life. He saw the beat up veterans and had his own injuries. He obviously had other interests/loves in his life that really just meant more than football to him. He made his money, and likely would have and is making good money anyways without football. It’s just not something you see often. Especially at QB.
Just because Luck was able to not get sacked doesn't mean he wasn't hit the most....or injured....
Right or wrong, qbs will always be judged on wins and super bowls.
On the one hand it's unfair on the other Kurt ain't exactly talking the team friendly deals to help himself out.
Nope.
unless its matt stafford
I don't fault him for retiring. He didn't need the money and he had passions more than football..not everyone lives and breathes football. But for that same exact reason I just don't see him going deep into his 30s no matter where he went. Football was a job for him.
And his biggest injury by far was the snowboarding one. Do you disagree with that?
He had an aggressive play style though. Not to the extent Josh Allen or anything but he was pretty mobile and embraced contact a lot from what I remember.      The context of the conversation was about his o line being a factor in his injuries. Now I don't think you guys had some amazing o line or anything but it isn't as bad as people make it seem. People are making it seem like you guys are the devil because of the protection and I just don't think that's the case.
Yeah, it's neat
Jesus Christ, no.  Wtf is wrong with you?  He got a lacerated kidney in a game, the type of injury you only see in bad car crashes.... you're embarrassing Colts fans please stop.

[As is tradition with Jets players wearing pantyhose.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wHia0cvW9Ho)
Coach: "OK, I need everyone to wear pantyhose"  Players: "Because of the cold weather?"  Coach: "Uh, sure let's go with that. Now walk around a bit in front of me to break them in"
This sounds about right for 1970's NFL football.
“Now where did I put my pantyhose?” - Bobby Hill
I’m telling you u/JaguarGator9, just do Jets trivia. Your sub will become incredibly popular when you talk about all the stupid shit the Jets have done
imagine trying to do this in 2023
This is hilarious considering 90% of skill players wear what is basically panty hose now.
Oh, Walt! You little mynx!
Lol this is fantastic.
A lot of players were so out of uniform back then by wearing their OWN cold weather gear.  Pretty much if you GOT it then WEAR it.  The different colored thermal longsleeves!  Some players even were windbreaker jackets under their uniforms! Nowadays since everything is licensed by the NFL, they pretty much have everything you need for any climate.  WEAR the  NFL choices or get FINED.
Anybody else watch all JaguarGator's stuff on 1.5x?
Mark Sanchez approved
How the hell did you just have that one on deck & ready to go, that's such an obscure bit of NFL lore lol
Pantyhose made for sports is still gonna be way better than pantyhose made to make your legs look hot.
Rex Ryan agrees.
I'd known about it for a good while, despite never having seen the ad. As soon as I saw the legs, I knew exactly what ad it was. I'd read about it in *The Football Book*, a gift from my parents in '01, and remember a good number of facts from it, this being one of them
Por que no los dos?
Plus, given some of the players' complaints, I imagine the gear they where now accommodates male genitals more comfortably
He just didn’t like that it covered the feet
Great deal that secures Big Jeff the bag and has really improved fanbase moral because if he had a AJ Brown 2.0 incident all over again idk who is paying money to watch a Titans game. Ran has already won the hearts of Titans fans with this deal alone.
Worth it, dude is an absolute game wrecker. That game he had against the Rams 2 years ago was one of the best defensive performances I’ve seen of late
This is the first I’ve seen him called Jeff instead of Jeffery and it just feels wrong
Glad we can finally stop hearing about trade rumors with Simmons. They never made any sense anyways.
Yea Quinnen is about to get the bag now sheesh
What a steal!
Great deal, beast of a player, absolutely fucking hate this
Good deal
So the fifth-year option, and then 3 years for $66m.   Then he’ll get cut or extended going into his age-30 season.
Dexter and Quinnen shouldn’t be making more than Simmons.  Good news for NY fans.
How much of that money goes to the woman he beat up?
Next is Quinnen Williams and Christian Wilkins, and maybe Dexter Lawrence and Ed Oliver.
Yes, feels like it had to be done and this is a good deal for both sides.
Now sign Lamar Jackson.
Against Cincy in the divisional rd 😤. Fuck you tanne😭
“Jeff Simmons” is weird. It’s either Jeffery Simmons or Big Jeff, no in between.
My name Jeff
I did a double take
p sure he goes by Jeff. I don't think it flows as well but idk, not my name
He got paid so now he is a Jeff
I almost didn't recognize him at first
I had 0 idea who this was due to him being called Jeff.
You know what else didn't make sense? AJ Brown trade rumors
It is hard to agree with a colts fan, but you are right the trade rumors were dumb. Simmons wanted to stay in nashville and we wanted to keep him. Sometimes it just takes some time and negotiations to come to terms on a new contract.
Wait Simmons is worth more than a late day 2 pick? Absolutely noone from the bears believes you.
You know what else didn't make sense? AJ Brown trade rumors
Quinnen and Dexter gonna cost NY like 200M combined with their contracts.
This is good news, I was expecting low 20s for Q so 21m APY would be just fine.
Yeah jealous AF. I don't see why he didn't ask for more money than what seems like the group behind him
Quinnen was first team all pro this year. He's going to want to match this contract or very slightly top it.
Dexter was out of position his first three years and under his first with Andre Patterson and Wink, playing NT, he thrived. He's going to get paid and it will be remarkably similar to this.
You better hope Schoen locks him up soon then lol. He’s gonna have a big year
And the fact they got this deal done is good for titans fans. Imagine if one of the other young premier DTs got 100M with 75 gtd. Would have made for a second AJB scenario for the titans.
Why not? They were both better this past year.      Simmons broke out a year before they did, but I think you’d be hard pressed to find many who’d taken him over Q/Dex.
Shouldn't doesnt mean they wont.  In all likelihood they either match or exceed this deal.  Its the new trend of the NFL, copy deals other players get but get slightly more.
9...fkn..sacks...with 3 coming from Big Jeff.  I'm still not over that shit
He’s Jeff simmons, aka Big Jeffery now
i'm fine with similar, don't think it should be more.
turn on Simmons 2022 playoff tape. you'll get your answer there.
Titans way to lose a gm 😒
Hefty Jefty
I don’t think Dex or Q are going to care much that he shredded a horrific offensive line two seasons ago when they were both much better interior rushers this past season.
ok? it's up to jets and giants gm's not to overpay.
It’s the market rate, they’re not overpaying. If they don’t exceed that contract then they’re not going to have an extension, it’s that simple.
franchise tag works for me.
Double-bodyweight squat is impressive.
Wait til' you hear how much Hurts can squat.
That doesn't really tell me anything without any knowledge of how your knee is supposed to be 13 weeks post surgery
Steve Keim is about to Tweet correcting his form.
Just giving y'all a headups, I will be insufferable when we are good again.
It looks looks like he's using a Playskool weight set.  I know he isn't doing that and that trying that lift would fuck me right up, but it's still really funny to watch him squat a barbell that has primary colored weights.
Im personally not a fan of short QB's, but K1 has gotten so much shit the last 2 offseasons its crazy. The way people talked about him you'd think he killed somebody
If you ain't parallel, that rep can go to hell
Look he just came off an ACL surgery so this insane. But to say “almost to depth” is a giant stretch.
Got to get in a few reps while COD is updating
Not even close to almost to depth lmao.
Probably wrecking kids on Xbox with all the down time healing up
“Driven may be an understatement”. Stop it.
My legs do that every day
How is that almost to depth? It's barely parallel at best.
He got off the video games long enough to post this?
Does he really want to compress his spine even more?
I can do that at 45, also good at COD sign me up
What's his kd tho
Yeah but did he do his homework?
Reps went up easy too.
At first, I was like, “not it’s not”, and then I got the joke
According to every broadcaster, he squats 7 million pounds per hour.
I heard he could move the earth in case of an imminent asteroid impact.
Nearly 3 kylers
Iirc it's also not to depth
Jalen Hurts squatting is the current version of the "Antonio Gates/Tony Gonzalez played basketball" that is required to be mentioned every single game.
You can typically do straight line/squatting motion fairly quickly. Cutting is what takes the longest.   You can start jogging at 8 weeks and running at like 12. Squatting typically around 6
Leg still attached = good
Yeah. It does not sound as impressive unless you told us that he's coming back from an injury. I used to squat 335 in college.
Again?
What about the second half of the season
> again   Bro having flashbacks to 2008
How….how old are you?
Tank for williams?
Yes, but you will be 72.
It's not really that uncommon. My gym has a couple colored Olympic sets. Those are what I use for deadlifts and any other barbell work
Found the guy who doesn't watch the Olympics
Especially those over played, done just for upvotes, call of duty comments.
If you can't go below parallel, you have flexibility issues and you should be working on hip mobility exercises rather than squatting and praying your uncooked spaghetti hips don't snap one day.
Below parallel or the rep can go to hell
Pretty dam close lmao relax unc
Original.
Yes its its
Haha exactly!
Ok
Jalen Hurts squats the sun up over Philadelphia
https://youtu.be/wigQv1ozF0M  Depth doesn’t look bad to me.
Hurts squatted 570 as a teenager in comp  He was a legit powerlifter in high school
Parallel isn’t to depth?
Athletes often do not squat to depth the way you would in a power lifting competition.   They shouldn’t find them selves buried that deep over while playing the sport and it increases injury risk. Train for your sport.   Many only go to depth for PRs so people don’t question the accomplishment.   If it’s not a power lifting meet or going for a world record, who cares.   Football players benefit going a shorter distance but adding weight or bursting out more explosively vs going ATG.
Yeah. WTF is with calling this almost to depth. Nah.  He's rehabbing. That's all. This far into it I'd hope he could bear weight on it doing some light squats.
Pretty sure that’s why “13 weeks post op” is in the title and what you used to squat has nothing to do with it lol.  I used to fuck cheer leaders in college wooo hooo
Cool
They were crushing it like 7 years ago.
In suffering
They'll be pretty bad next year assuming Kyler is ready to go around Week 12. Which means he might not play at all.  So pick Williams #1 Overall, let Murray start the next year, hope he's back to 2021 Week 1-8 form, trade him for three 1sts, start Williams.  Pretty unlikely scenario. But Williams with 3 extra firsts would be a crazy start to a rebuild
Olympic bodybuilders don't have Kyler Murray's proportions, which is a big part of the equation here.  But it is true do not watch Olympic weightlifting. Caught me red handed not doing something boring.
Squatting lots and lots of reps can help (it fixed my depth for me), but that was with a very light weight and with a box underneath to target depth.   Loading a bunch of weight on the bar and then squatting with shit form/not to depth is a great way to get hurt.
or your bone structure is just really not built for deep squats, but yes mobility has to be worked on regardless
Honestly with the amount of people that hate Kyler here, I’m surprised he’s not the top comment
Yet accurate
Like the other guy said, it’s really not. In highschool, a very large portion of the football team was in the “300 club” and we got T-shirts for squatting 300, and most of us weren’t yet 150, I was 125 myself and was very much not the picture of strength lol
The adrenaline of hitting this lift in this hyped up room must be an all timer
I was indeed incorrect. That would pass fine at a powerlifting meet for sure.
Watching this video while on the toilet is super motivating
I know reddit gets sick of people talking about it but that is still absolutely unbelievable to me. The hours a week over probably 10+ years to get to that point when your job is to *throw* the ball, and to be one of the best on earth at throwing it, that's crazy
Me either. There might be someone who wants to nitpick.  But that person also probably can't squat 600lbs.
Hmm TIL, that's neat. Wonder what he could have done as a weightlifter. Shame he went into football
Patella needs to break the hip crease.
If we’re being technical no, but for a football player it doesn’t matter
Personally I don't think so, and the squat I recall from Hurts wasn't really what I'd call obviously parallel.
If you regress his thickness to the mean…
Full depth, per the preponderance of the literature that I've seen, decreases injury risk from training. As a sanity check on that, weightlifters squat to full depth (and catch snatches and cleans in deep squats) all the time and that sport has a *very* low rate of injury.   I understand the sport specificity argument. I was not trying to argue that football players *should* squat deeper (unless the data show that it gets you stronger faster or decreases on-field injuries)
It's wild watching teams go from bad to good to bad to good again all while we've sucked so bad lol. Man I really we make the playoffs this season.
The Carolina Panthers and the Arizona Cardinals were facing each other in the NFC Championship game less than 8 years ago. We are picking #1 and #3 overall in the draft.
Williams? Trade back and get a haul + Marvin Harrison Jr. 😎
Bumper plates have been pretty standard in most gyms for the last decade. They're not a new thing.
Yeah most of the standard olympic bumper plates are color coded to easily identify weight on the bar. It's been a thing in Olympic weightlifting for a long time and it got popular in commercial and home gyms because of CrossFit over the last ~15 years or so.   It's not really weird to not know that if you don't care about weightlifting at all.
> Olympic bodybuilders  lol  > don't have Kyler Murray's proportions  Murray is 5'10 and 205ish lbs  The US's last olympian around that weight was [Kendrick Farris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Farris) who is basically the same height as Kyler (5' 9").  Kyler has very normal proportions and height for a weightlifter.
Yea I really hope that’s not what people got from my comment lol. I could not get past parallel at first either because my post COVID body was super inflexible and imbalanced, but doing yoga/pilates and taking stretching seriously helped me get to the point where I can almost touch my butt on the ground. The frog stretch is the GOAT stretch for hip mobility.
It took 9 months of call of duty comments for this sub to finally get sick of it.
Listen bro I don't have an opinion about this. Other than you think I'm so dumb you had to explain the joke.like yeah I got it. I was just making fun of the "not it's not" with a yes it's its. That's it man
Absolutely no fucking way you were 125 squatting 300 lmao thats borderline Olympic level shit
Everything come out okay?
This is the internet.    Lying is illegal or something like that
Depends on the kind of weight lifting. His height would tend to work against him in Olympic lifting. For power lifting, who knows? His frame is somewhat thin for the really elite levels, but there’s no saying what a guy could do if he really wanted it.
Might be hard with Miami and Buffalo being as good as they are. But y’all are a QB away.  Must feel nice to be out from under the Pats’ thumb. Could be worse. You could be the Raiders.
Dude, Id say you guys were good.last season in spite of the QB position and injuries. I know that doesnt make you feel better but you have a good team and, with a competent QB for the entire season, you wouldve made the playoffs. And, I think youll be an even better team this year.
In fairness y’all were supposed to be picking at 9  But yeah
Nah assuming Williams keeps progressing he's a no brainer unless you have Mahomes/Burrow/Herbert/Lawrence.
I don't think it's unusual that he's using them, I just think it's funny to see the QB who looks like a toddler when he runs lifting weights that remind me of toddler toys. It's not just the colors, it's the Kyler.
I've seen color coded weights forever, so I've probably even seen it with plates and not cared, but I saw one of those plastic red cars with yellow tops this morning and it really reminded me of that.  [Those are apparently made by Little Tikes](https://i.redd.it/rzccf2juiid11.jpg), though, so Playskool got some free press for nothing.
I figured most high end powerlifters are pretty short (5’5-5’8) since there would be less range of motion to move heavy weight
125 squatting 300 is a lie for that guy but also def not Olympic level
Lmao I can see the half squat now
 Beyond Olympic level?? Come on man lol
I was squatting 315 weighing 135, then later 405 while weighing 165 so I don’t think it’s that crazy. But maybe I’m underestimating lol  I’m also not an exceptional athlete whatsoever especially not now
We had a squat machine so we didn’t have to worry about balance, but we absolutely did the weight. I think you’d be shocked how much you can probably squat
Think they might be a little stopped up.
Weightlifting (no space) means Olympic lifting jsyk.  And I'm sure he'd be quite a bit thicker had he pursued either sport, but his athleticism and strength make me think he'd be more impressive as a weightlifter than as a powerlifter
Because that’s “the standard.” I also didn’t say Jalen didn’t go to depth, I was just answering your question about depth. Depending on someone’s anatomy “parallel” may not be “deep enough.”   I agree Jalen’s depth is fine here. I love Hurts. The reason depth is argued about is because there’s a very significant difference in strength between someone doing 3/4 ROM like Kyler and someone going “deep enough.” And to be fair, Kyler is fine at that depth for the start of rehab.
We (or at least I) wasn't talking about the sport specificity of Hurt's squat, but I would not call it parallel (again from what I recall).  Murray obviously is likely working on improving ROM still so I'm not going to make any judgements about his technical execution of a squat until at least next offseason.  For what it's worth, you'll build more muscle mass and have a lower risk of injury from a deep squat, even if it doesn't mimic the stance one finds himself in during a game of football
They need to actually win vs New England first
Yeah it was the best year in like a decade lol, have high hopes going into this season!
/kyler on a $81.5 mil dead cap hit
Herbert lol. Hurts >
I have so many dents in my walls because of that effing thing.
Depends on the weight class obviously. Idk about typical sizes in powerlifting but in weightlifting you pretty much don't see anyone over 6' except in some rare cases for the super heavies.  A lot of the men who are "normal" weights (say like 160-190 lbs) tend to be <5' 10". Our 73 kg (160 lbs) Olympian last cycle is 5' 5". The 81 kg (~180 lbs) lifter is like 5' 7".  Interestingly the women tend to have more variance in their heights (Again, in weightlifting. No idea about powerlifting)
You’re right I was def stretching it but that’s still borderline professional powerlifter
Im exaggerating but that’s still an elite level of powerlifting
Smith machines don't count as squats lol
Nah I wouldn’t be shocked because I know exactly how my body mechanics work. The fact you were on a machine is already a red flag and it sounds like you were just doing a leg press. But that said, there’s no way on earth you guys were doing a clean, full-depth squat at anywhere near 300 pounds as 125 lbs high schoolers.
I’m aware of what it meant. That’s why I said how he’d do as an Olympic style lifter. I was simply expanding on my thoughts of his prospects in other weight lifting disciplines. Height works against weightlifters. Doesn’t mean they can’t be successful, but generally means it is harder for tall people to reach the top of the sport.
Yeah I got my comments mixed up, my mistake. You were just stating a fact about standards. Sorry bout that! Have a great weekend.
you guys could just give Lamar 200mil/4yr already and win 11-12 games a year the next 3-4 years and get Bill his wins record.  I'm not huge on Lamar, but he's got enough physical talent to do well in the regular season mostly if he can keep from crumpling and Bill can do the rest.
Yeah once you take weight class out of the equation then you get hafthor worlds strongest strong man types who are just massive, massive humans overall.  I imagine it also help to have a low non muscular weight which a shorter person would have less then an equivalent taller person in the same class.
He's only 1" taller than the 109 kg gold medalist in Tokyo lol he's not a giraffe
I wish we would
Again, I’m just saying it makes it harder to compete at that level and rise to the top. Not saying he couldn’t. Just saying he’s not ideally suited for weightlifting.  Also, he’s closer in size to the 96 kg division.
Competition weights are based on heights. He'd compete in weightlifting at 102 or 109.
[More:  Jeff Simmons gets $66M guaranteed, which includes a $24M signing bonus. In all, he’s under contract for $104.75M over 5 years (including his fifth-year options).](https://twitter.com/RapSheet/status/1644427975289368582)
Shoutout to that guy in the other thread who guessed 4yr $96m
Worth
I remember thinking he was such a steal back when he was drafted.
*sweats in Quinnen*
Well, that’s the starting price for Chris Jones now. He’s probably gonna end up with a 4 yr 105 now with 75 guaranteed. With us or someone else. Shit.
Ooga Chaka
Well, Robinson is truly gone! Philly, you can leave us alone now.
Oh fuck
Jrob could never get me to cum my pants at work quite like this
Honestly way cheaper than I thought, I’m happy we got it done before Wilkins, Quinnen Williams, and Sexy Dexy deals bc the DT market is about to explode.
Sexy Dexy is gonna be expensive. Get that deal done soon, Joe.
That's a Big Bag for Big Jeff.
Waiting for the guarantees before reacting
That's big boi money
Damn. That's a decent chunk.
That is honestly pretty cheap!
Christian Wilkins about to get paid
God damnit Titans-_-
He’s a great player. A lowkey prick on the field but good for him
Glad we grabbed Hargrave early now, sheesh. He’s older, but had more sacks, tackles (combined and solo), more QB hits, and fumble recoveries. Solid deal though for a franchise cornerstone.
Wow.
Wtf that’s so much NFL money.
Good for him. Really hoped he'd hit FA next year, but that was a pipe dream
These DT contracts yeesh.
 Hope he cashes it out into quarters and fills a pool with them.
This just seems like a win-win contract, am I wrong? Titans get one of their core defensive players signed up long term and Simmons gets paid so he doesn't have to think about FA or his team situation for the next few years.
He damn near nailed it
Yeah but they also only guessed $50m guaranteed ($66m actual), and that's the only real number
Kinda of an easy prediction if you have been following the market. He’s a bit better than Daron Payne, who got a 4/90 deal. 4/95-4/100 seemed pretty obvious. Jones is a bit older, so I’d say he’ll probably get something like 3/81.
So fucking worth it, that dude earned it as well with how hard that guy plays. He's one of the first players I think of when they talk about how NFL defenses are fundamentally different to college bc you have to try to stop and survive 300lbs of muscle trying to get through.
Wanna trade a 1st for him? I mean, that 1st could be anything- could even be Big Jefè.
High risk high reward. It paid off for once for JRob.
*sweats equally in Sexy Dexy*
The old Titans would have waited for every other DT to get paid and then say we can't afford them. glad ran isn't a fucking dumbass
Feel like he was always gonna ask for $25m APY minimum so thankfully Simmons is slightly below it.
Jones stated not that long ago that he wouldn't play for another team. So there's that at least.  Just fucking pay the man Veach, we wouldn't have one, let alone two rings if it wasn't for him. He's 28, about to be 29. He's up there with Kelce and Mahomes for most valuable assets on the team.
Jones is old. He will not get that
Sexy Dexy is gonna get like 4 yrs 102 or something like that so I feel your pain
I can't stop this feeling, deep inside of me
But the pipeline is working great for everyone involved…well mostly everyone
JRob would occasionally work a tiddlywink of cum out of me every once in a while, but not like this. Ran milks loads.
Simmons better than all of em too
66
no you must right now whats it going to be?
When has he been a prick on the field?
You talking about last year where Simmons played on a high ankle sprain for more than half the season and his supporting cast was all missing time?  Watch one game and you can see him hopping at the end of every single down, gutting it out.
Aaahhh! It's not a liquid! It's a great many pieces of solid matter that form a hard, floor-like surface!
Then he dives in and bobs out, spitting out a stream of quarters
needs a couple pools
The hard part is that the titans are spending a lot to keep a core of talented players that ensure they are mediocre for the next few seasons. I don’t think they have the capital to get back to where they were a couple of seasons ago, and they’re no closer to solving their QB situation.   Not saying this move was wrong by any means, but there’s a solid argument that they could have gotten picks for him especially in 2024, trade Henry, try to tank with Malik at QB, then be in perfect position to get their future QB in 2024
Impossibly wrong and bad guess
Really for a contract like this where you’d hope he’d be right in the middle of his prime as it finishes (he’s be 29) there’s a decent chance he sees all 4 years - no reason barring injuries to think he’s gonna drop off and not get another mega deal
Couldn't agree more. He shot up his ankle before every game for most the season. Dude is just a warrior and I'm so happy we didn't fuck this up.
And then it never paid off again
I assume both these guys are gonna get similar deals and both will be worth it. Monsters.
when you’re done in a decade do we get a turn?
Normal is such a relief when you’re used to fucking dumbass.
Carr said the same about 14 months before he signed with another team.
Literally every player says that when they're trying to land a fat paycheck. Wouldn't be a great starting point if they were like "I don't give a shit about this team, I'm just trying to get that bag."  Of course, both sides know that it all comes down to the number of zeros after the dollar sign, but it sets a good tone and helps ramp up the fan pressure when they're like "Come on, [GM]! [Good Player] said he wants to retire with [Our Team] and wouldn't play for any other team!"  It's like the stages of grief. Next he has to remove references to the team on social media.
Girl, you just don't realize  What you do to me 🎵
Shootin webs like spiderman
You keep saying this despite Big Q and Dex being better in every facet of the game last year.      Simmons is still a borderline elite interior rusher and an elite run defender, but he’s a step behind those two.
Maybe the time he spit in Marshal Yandas face and then didn’t even deny it. Or maybe the time he punched Ted Karras even though the bengals were in victory formation? I’m not going to start on what he did off the field
Box score watchers haha
Solid deal though for a franchise cornerstone.
No thanks.  Already enough injuries
How does keeping a core of TALENTED players mean we will be MEDIOCRE?  Should we keep a core of mediocre players so we can be talented instead?
The titans are in a precarious position sure, but Simmons is the special kinda player you'd retain for a rebuild anyway
I don’t think either hold a candle to Simmons
He was also told by said team to kick rocks as they no longer wanted him around. In that instance I think it's probably fair to say he stuck by HIS word
When Jeff holds me, in his arms so tight
Last year big jeff played on one leg. Healthy jeff >
Jeff admitted to shooting up his ankle for most of the season, along with a mile of tape, he was reduced to a run stopper more than a rusher.  But even on one leg he was well above average.
Jeff is the 2nd best DT in football. Aaron donald is 1st. Enjoy your 3rd place debates, but come on now.
I’m not trying to hate man, I’m a Bears fan. I know what it’s like to flirt with the playoffs every year just to fall short because you don’t have a QB and Oline, only to play just well enough that you aren’t in position to get a top tackle or QB the following year. It’s an endless cycle of mediocrity.
Quinnen was first team all-pro, don’t think anyone had a better year besides Jones.   First year quinnen has had any semblance of surrounding talent too
Quinnen absolutely does
They’re both better than Simmons, odd take.
I can feel life leaving my body and the fading of light
He lets me know, it's fourth down alright
Defense wins championships. I'm ecstatic with spending $104M over 5 years to keep a top 1 to 3 DT (depending on the week) on a 3-4 defense that prides itself on stopping the run. Dude is a monster.
Lmao not a chance . Simmons is top 3 right after Donald and Chris jones
Not really anymore but even so it's ridiculous the guy above is saying locking up your core young players is a bad thing lol. Also I'm a firm believer that trenches wins championships so this is a huge W for the titans
It's just Anthony Richardson trying to convince the Titans not to trade up for him don't let him confuse you. Big Jeff is the guy
What exactly is Simmons better at?      The top 3 this last year are indisputably Dex, Jones, and Williams. You could shuffle those three pretty easily.      Dex and Williams are both better at pressuring the QB and they’re both better at stuffing the run.      I think you were just not paying attention last year and are stuck in 2021.      Either way, saying they “don’t hold a candle” is an objectively bad take.
You mean I’m examining their careers in totality and not just the recent success they just had? Williams and Lawrence have never been as consistent as Simmons has been his whole career
But they were both better last year. If you wanna take Jeff, sure, but saying they “don’t hold a candle” despite being better in every facet of the game this past year is a little silly.
Simmons was also playing on a bum ankle for half of last year and still was better than almost every other DT in the league.
I watched Lawrence get completely erased in a playoff game last year. Gimme Jeff simmons every single time
The bears gonna race down to podium for this pick.  😳    too soon?
Just before this, Carter visited the lions and the lions did their homework on him....
They are probably doing their homework on all top prospects, including QBs. This doesn't really mean anything.
for the Bears fans out there: would you rather take Jalen and his talents plus baggage or just play it safe and take like Paris Johnson to help Fields?  I know it’s a pretty top to bottom rebuild in Chicago right now (outside of QB and WR), but I feel like the commitment to Fields means you really gotta commit to him. No better way than to get a big OT to anchor the OL.
If the Bears land Carter still after getting all those picks for the 1st overall that would be crazy. It would legit be the most perfect situation for them.
sounds like a great cover story. “yeah we know he is irresponsible and his street racing caused someone to die but his hometown friends say he’s a nice guy”
Of all the prospects, Jalen Carter is the one I want nothing to do with at 9.  Maybe he gets his shit together, but I sure as shit dont believe he will. Too risky for a team like us to chance in my opinion.
He isn’t getting passed the bears, Eagles fans that want him better hope we trade up
I still think he is going to the Seahawks or Lions
Either Carter is long gone by #9 or there's something so major that it makes no sense to draft him at #9 either.
If there’s one thing Chicago is known for, it’s overlooking sordid personal history to advance itself. I’m not surprised that it’s football team has the same attitude.
Jalen Carter is going to be an Aldon Smith 2.0.
Carter's a bear let's be real.
He’ll beat them there
Bear Down for Jalen Carter
Can we just copy your homework? We wanna play videogames.
I found the Lions notes, it says "pass on Jalen Carter, draft Bijan, and give Montgomery back."   Can you forward that to the organization for me, they are probably looking for it.
Is this true?
Every team should be doing extensive homework on Carter given his talent and character concerns
Bears doing their homework on a QB is the worst thing we could do. We cheated our way through that class for the last 50 years. Ain't a clue on how to do QB homework. 3/4 of these first round QBs could be HOFers and we would manage to pick the one with the Ryan Leaf career trajectory.
The Bears haven't brought in any QBs for top 30 visits so it's different.
God I hope not. I do not want they guy drafted by us.
Grilling is the wrong word to use here. Having done front office work in a different sport, I've had my share of calls like this before. Usually just asking questions, following up on previous stories you heard, and seeing if there's any new information to follow up on. When investing millions into a person you want to do your absolute best in finding out who that person is. Sometimes you find someone like a teacher who has new information that is valuable to you. And it's easy to tell when someone is just trying to jerk the guy off with praise and cast that information aside.
I'm assuming it's like putting down references on your resume
100% give me Paris Johnson. Carter may be the next great interior DL, but I have very little faith he doesnt do some stupid shit again. We're not in a position to take such a big risk given all of our needs.
100% give me Jalen Carter. PJJ may be the next great exterior OT, but I have very little faith he doesn't develop into some shit OT again. We're not in a position to take such a big risk given all of our needs.
Jalen Carter if he’s there, JSN if he’s not. As a former offensive lineman, Ryan Poles should be able to find OL talent later in the draft.
Carter 10000%.   We’re gonna need to gamble if we want to be good.   I guess Bears fans hate adding good players 🙄
Play it safe + better pass protection > Jalen Carter.   I know our run protection was solid last year but pass pro needs to be a little better. Coupled with Jalen Carters seemingly serious work ethic concerns I don’t want him picked. And that’s not even factoring in potential other character concerns with him.
Qb, WR, RB, TE, Safety, CB. LB. Special teams I actually feel really good about.  Oline has some good pieces, dlines not great...  As for the question I'd rush to the stage for Carter.  I don't even understand the counterpoint really.
His street racing caused someone to die is an insane statement.  A college student and other college students both chose to drive stupidly, one did so under the influence without wearing a seatbelt and sadly lost their life.  Carter didnt cause them to die, he sadly jusy chose to also drive wrecklessly.  You saying Carter caused him to die is just a really depressing way to view it.  Carter made a mistake and drove poorly, he didn't cause any death.
Past*
I am not one of those fans; Bears can have him.
Then leave and come back later?
Just watch the body cam footage. It will tell you everything you need to know.
Yes, he was there last week and Dan Campbell said that they learned something interesting about him when talking to ex teammates (in a good way).  Edit: for those that don't believe me https://twitter.com/DetroitOnLion/status/1640809478525276193
I think you're picking out the least important part of OP's comment to respond to...
Imagine talking about not taking risks while also clamoring to draft Johnson lmao.   100% give me Carter, PJJ may be the next great OT, but I have very little faith he doesn't turn into another fucking first round bust again. We're not in a position to take such a big risk given all of our needs.

Carter may be the next great exterior DT, but I have very little faith he doesn't do something stupid again and gets arrested. We're not in a position to take such a big risk given all of our needs.
Fans don’t hate good players. Fans hate good players who have work ethic problems and players who are likely to be arrested for doing more stupid shit. Watch the video of Carter getting arrested dude is a complete moron
Tomato tomato
Only if they crash
Was it in a good way? Was that ever clarified? Last I saw, Dan just said ‘interesting’
People just downvote anything huh
How would you feel about taking him, what are Lions fans feeling?
Hey man, I'm mad and there's nowhere else to shout.
Bears fans been high on hopium since like week 10 last year
Old coaches and or players from the area. Helps when they come from hotbed recruiting areas.
You'd be surprised how incredibly easy it is to find this information online. Literally just google the high school.
I mean taking Carter is also a pretty big risk at this point I’d say.
Are you a bot…?
Dude did you post this comment three different times with alt accounts?
He seems to have work ethic concerns too right? Obviously the character/maturity issues are bad too, but that plus the work ethic thing kinda scares me.
I didn’t ask
Yeah, that was literally the report https://twitter.com/DetroitOnLion/status/1640809478525276193
Lions fans are all over the board. Some want a QB, some want carter, some insist on trading down, some insist on trading up.  Imho the only glaring holes on the team are the LB Corps and backup/development QB. Outside of that, every position is at least healthy enough. I bring it up because without any glaring holes on the roster, the fans tend to see the holes that they want to see. The recipe makes for zero consensus.  About the only things that everyone seems to agree on is will Anderson if he is somehow available or draft an LB in the second round, and at least a development QB in the late rounds.
I don’t want him. Character concerns are too much, IMO.
Lions fans are still feeling numb
Have you tried yelling at clouds? I think one of these days they are finally gonna start yelling back at me
Ya it's all reciprocal, you take a call from the bears, wow look at that the bears are willing to put a call into a recruiting prospect to vouch for your program
This. And then asking them if they have anyone else in mind I could talk to.   I never asked them why they chose to speak with me, but being polite and friendly can carry you a long way.
Weird but I posted before the other guy who stole my comment basically.  I was copying the guy above me though and swapped PJJ with Carter though since I thought it’s a ridiculous take to call PJJ a risk and not the player who got arrested
Dude it literally never says "in a good way" that's why people are down voting you
That's always a good problem. When thats the case it can't ever hurt to build the trenches for years to come so seems like carter or anders would be great options
Who would you like?
Wow I had no idea
Will Anderson would be a dream, but I doubt he’ll fall that far. Tyree Wilson would be good, otherwise whoever the best CB is. IDK who that will end up being though. Trade back would always be nice, but don’t expect that to happen either.   In all reality, I trust our GM to pick a great football player. I think Jalen Carter is a great player, but his situation is very concerning.
To be fair, when Henry has one of his monster 200 yard 3 td games, you don't need many other players on offense
TLDR: Tannehill restructure for Julio fucked the Titans and JRob wasn’t a great GM.   We know.
You really can't compare cap hits without looking at teams that have restructured players.  The Titans haven't restructured either Tannehill or Henry this year.  They could reduce the two and have a QB + RB cap hit of around 25 million.  That doesn't mean they should do that, but Sharp is comparing their cap hit to teams that have done that.
Both Tannehill and Henry are on relatively good contracts though.  The Titans just borrowed too much money from the future and now the future is here and it's not looking too bright.
One year later I still can't believe they galaxy brain'd themselves into trading Brown
I'll never forget Titans fans justifying lowballing the shit out of AJB, saying he's overrated and not a WR1 you can rely on. Welp.  Shout out to the ones still trolling his Twitter all the time lol.
Ouch
If GB trades Rodgers, 48% of GBs offense cap will be spent on Rodgers and Aaron Jones.
Was confused how Tannehill is the 2nd highest paid QB, then looked and appears everyone is just pushing their hits down the road
Fortunately he's only 29 and nothing horrible ever happens to RBs past that age
Apparently you need a $36.6M QB to hand him the ball.
Maybe in 1980. This decade having a multi-game 200 yard rusher likely means no Super Bowl chances for you
>JRob wasn’t a great GM.  He was a good GM. Just made some terrible decisions that caught up to him. His tenure was the most exciting time to be a Titans fan since the McNair years and we should be grateful for that.
We didnt even keep Corey Davis, AJ Brown, Johnu Smith, or Jack Conklin after that 2019 run while JRob gambled on Bud Dupree coming off an ACL, Denico Autry (that one worked out) and mortgaging the future on Julio. This is why he cried at the combine after the bengals playoff game.
I don't know how teams didn't see that Julio Jones was washed when they made that move.  I'm just some idiot nobody and these guys endlessly look over tape and injury history and said "hey let's take this risk"  Just made no sense given what we had see from him before that
I don't know I thought he was a good gm that aj brown trade was crazy good
Tannehill and Henry are on the last year of their deals
The future looks fine. The present is where things a bit tight
Also they have 3rd least offense spending. 30th most expensive is a weird way of saying they aren't spending a lot on offense.
Hate that he in Philly.  Dude a stud
Not really they. Pretty much one guy in our former GM.
Pay the RB, trade the WR. What a dumb move
I kinda think Burks will end up being good at least.
Wasn’t me. And fuck those who pushed the “injury prone” agenda on him once he was traded.   1. He played at least 13 games each of his three seasons with us  2. Appeared in 17 games with the Eagles last year and we are legit the most injured team the past two seasons combined with a record breaking amount in 2021. I wonder who’s fault was that?
To be fair I see the same shit with every single fan base. You should see how Eagles fans flipped when CJGJ was signed by the Lions.
Dude made tannahill so much money.
Glad I'm not the only one that still remembers.  The mental gymnastics fans do to justify their teams moves is crazy.
That was highly annoying. There was nothing to justify that trade. I'll hate it forever.  Fans are crazy.
Just ask Eddie George!
Don’t you put that evil on us
It would have panned out if y'all had made it to or won the Superbowl, but the Chiefs had to exist
I didn’t say he was bad. I said he wasn’t great. He had a lot of misfires and a lot of hits. I certainly didn’t hate the guy and probably defended him more than I should have.
Yeah he was good not great, but definitely better than what we had seen recently.   He was good enough to bring us out of constant mediocrity, but he made too many blunders in trading AJ, fielding an atrocious OL, and missing in quiet a lot of his early round draft picks.   I appreciate Robinson for what he was, but I’m hoping Ran can put together a plan to get over the hump.
I mean Julio was coming off 51 and 771 and 3Tds with Atlanta in a scenario were he seemed ready to be gone and just 9 games. That is pretty good for someone not all in. A 2nd is probably too much either way, but the drop off really came in Tennessee. I am all for teams giving us 2nds for Wrs though cause it seems to work out well for us, thank you NE and Ten.
Shots fired.  Damn I hate you guys got him for that pick
You running internet explorer?
Would’ve been even better if he gave us Big Jeff for the low too
Which is good bc Tanny won’t be there long
We’ll see apparently Vrabel hated the Willis and Burks picks the old GM made and thats probably the reason he kept his job. Hopefully Burks can get on the field more
Yeah it was definitely not all Titans fans. But any rational titans fans that expressed support for AJB was immediately downvoted and shat on. That narrative was such a fucking joke. Titans sub hivemind was just circlejerking so hard.
I don’t think the Chiefs are relevant to this conversation. The Titans never once came close to winning a SB in the last few years, with or without the Chiefs existing…
>probably defended him more than I should have.   Dude I admit I was in denial for awhile. I was a J Rob truther through and through. Then the AJ revenge game happened and then once he was canned I started to see the clearer picture. He had a hell of a run though.
Look at flair
i got downvoted for saying we didn't deserve to be in the playoffs and i'd rather take a higher pick than get clobbered by whoever.
You don't think that the Titans losing to the Chiefs in the AFC Championship game a few years ago prevented the team from coming close to winning a Superbowl?
They literally lost to the Chiefs in the AFC championship to go to the Super Bowl. At one point they were up 13-0! Then Mahomes stuff happened.
I defended a lot of moves. Not all of them but a lot. Particularly his draft picks and letting some people walk in FA. Half of them I still think were good decisions. Sometimes the gamble doesn’t work. Beasley, Dupree, Julio and AJ were all awful moves though.
I’m aware, as I said. You running internet explorer?
A Chiefs team we somehow held a two score lead on for almost the entire first half.  Watching our coaching staff try and sit on a 10 point lead against Andy Reid was two quarters of torture.  We had the players to beat them, we just ... didn't.  But had we decided to even a tiny bit aggressive in the second half, there's a very good chance we make our second super bowl and just as good odds we come away with our first W.
They would not have beaten SF
Literally one Mahomes scramble where our team didn't want to touch him cost us.
Lol and then they would have been absolutely smoked by the 49ers. They were a 9-7 team that didn’t even win their division. Going up against the 13-3 first seed Niners who had the best record in the NFC and a bye. Titans had a +70 point differential while the Niners were +169.   Niners scored the 2nd most points in the league, with the 2nd most rushing yards. 2nd in total defense (ypg), first in passing defense. Won both of their playoff games with ease until the SB.   You’re underestimating the 2019 Niners, and way overrating the 2019 Titans. All of the postseason rankings I just checked had them as a bottom 3 playoff team, with 538 statistically giving them a less than 1% chance to win the SB, compared to the Niners at 13%. I know anything can happen, but the Titans really were never close to winning a Super Bowl. Never even made it to the big game.
If the Packers beat the Giants in the 07 NFCCG, do you think we’d be saying 15+ years later “The Giants would never have beaten the 18-0 Patriots”?  Never say never
>They would not have beaten SF  They said the same thing when we played the Patriots and then the MVP Lamar Ravens in the postseason that year. Any given Sunday.
Lol. Whether it's the Chiefs or Titans, Jimmy still misses that throw.
You’re right San Fran hasn’t been known to choke in big games under shanny
That play was absolutely brutal. Maybe they score anyway but that play just defeated our defense.
You can throw out all the stats you want, but that game never happened, and your entire argument is based on a lot of “what ifs,” which is why you’re being (rightfully) downvoted.   The fact is, the 2019 Titans lost to the Chiefs, so the 2019 49ers didn’t get a chance to play the Titans in the SB that year. We can’t know the results of a contest that didn’t happen.
Shoulda. Woulda. Coulda.
Man what a missed opportunity that year was..
Many people actually picked the Titans over the Pats. The 49ers were so good that postseason.
Difference being Jimmy misses that throw, and the ball goes back to the Titans down by 2 TDs lol. We were better than them in every single stat, offense and defense. Nobody except the Chiefs was beating us that year. Titans barely finished 9-7 and didn’t even win their own division.
We don’t need Jimmy to make that throw against Tennessee lmao
The only game we really "choked" was that 2019 Super Bowl.
I'll never forget they showed Vrabels face after that run and he looked so fucking pissed lmao
Lmao this dude is on crack. The Titans dominated TOP is all 3 playoff games. Frank Clark & Honeybadger double teamed Derrick Henry and still couldn’t stop him. It took having to hit him every play whether he had the ball or not to slow him down and force Tannehill to pass
Lmao stats is the only thing to go off of. And the stats show that the Titans weren’t even close to that level.   Titans are maaaaybe the 4th most successful team in the AFC recently? Certainly behind the Chiefs, Bengals, and Ravens. Not close to winning a SB, the roster is not good enough.
And yet nothing to show for it
Titans were 2-4 that year before Tannehill took over, they finished 7-3 after Mariota was benched.  You have a lot of confidence for someone who doesn’t know what the hell they’re talking about.
Huge air of confidence for having lost.
What a stupid take lol. Sanders was wide open and he missed… meaning Jimmy would’ve missed that against any team.   Wtf are you smoking lmao
Was that not the exact same SB that the titans would’ve played you in?
So you lost as many games in 10 as we lost in 16? LOL
QB misses a deep ball, that's not very uncommon. We probably don't need to hit a homerun ball against the Titans because let's be honest, they're the fucking Titans.  People forget how good we were in 2019.
Sure but in this hypothetical that game would have been taken away.
To be clear DTR is old. He’s a fifth year senior. Yes he’s younger than Hooker, but Hendon Hooker is the oldest person who ever existed.
Lots of them disagree with you on arm strength and his deep passing is generally not good.
As a UCLA fan, it's because sometimes you get DTR, he's running all over everyone, scoring TDs, signing autographs during touchdown celebrations, and everything is great.  Sometimes, tho, sometimes you get DeeTR, and, yeah, we don't talk about that.  He has gotten much more consistent as his experience has grown, though.
Who is DTR, that would be a helpful start.
DTR will have a decent career as a backup to an athletic type QB like Lamar or Fields or Kyler - he’s Tyler Huntley-esque
He is seen as a low upside, undersized, and older. So yeah, while he beats most prospects at something, he doesn't beat most of them at things that matter to nfl teams.  Good news, he looks like a high floor kind of guy, that could be useful running a variety of offenses so he will likely always have a job but never be the guy as there is likely someone out there that will always be better at an offense that a team wants to run.
I agree. There’s no way I’d take him over Richardson or Levis simply because of their value and ceiling relative to DTR. But yeah, i’m with you, I really like DTR.
Cowboys could use a project.  I wouldn't mind in 5th or 6th
I’m high on him personally but mainly because he projects as a good backup to Fields, as in the offense would not need to change much in terms of what they’re trying to accomplish on the Fields.  We took a step in the right direction getting PJ Walker over Siemian, but I feel like we still need someone closer to Justin’s skillset.
Admittedly I only watched about 3 UCLA games while he was there, but I never saw anything from him that looked NFL ready. He didn’t even look like a good college quarterback.
Who
I love DTR he's gna be great..but he does do alot of bonehead shit that leaves you scratching your head. With the right coaching he will be great tho
Do we really have to now keep track of acronyms of all the draft prospects names? Is it that fucking hard to just type the guys name once somewhere in the post?
I’m in agreement with you, and I’m hoping he’s who the Seahawks target in later rounds. He improved every year, which is an important signifier for how a QB will transition IMO. Like you said he has all the tools, and from what I’ve heard everyone who spends time with him has nothing but good things to say about the mental side.
He reminds me of Tyrod Taylor, with Dak Prescott as the ceiling.
Grade of 5.69 puts him in the “Candidate for bottom of roster or practice squad” section. Oof
We should be talking about the top 6.  I think DTR will get a legit shot at being a starter and he has the skill set to be one.  I would probably tank him as the 6th QB in this class, but I still think he's on that tier with the others.
Gives me Dak vibes just looking at his weaknesses.
He was horrible,  embarrassingly bad, at the combine.  Couldn't hit the broadside of a barn.
Is he more athletic than Young?
Maybe the Ravens can take him in the first round to replace Lamar Jackson.
Why do you think his tape was better?
He is raw as hell for one
So I'm not an expert or a self-appointed scout, but basically from what other scouting reports are saying, there are a lot of things he's getting docked for:  * mechanics aren't very good, with a long release and very frantic footwork * his deep ball lacks accuracy, touch, and depth * he doesn't read defenses all that well, often losing track of defenders * questionable decision making and can rely on his creativity to a fault, which causes unnecessarily chaotic situations * concerns about his frame (a few inches taller than Bryce Young, but only 10 pounds heavier which is going to lead to a pretty lean frame)  I also see in multiple reports that his arm strength and velocity really aren't that good, so IDK where you're getting the 3rd best arm strength in the class
Like Richardson and Gator fans, I've seen many UCLA fans comment here that DTR is just not good.
Brandon Weeden said "Damn, that guy old!".
This is Stetson Bennett erasure
I watched a few games with him, most of the drop backs it seemed like he was lost and trying to figure it out on the fly.  Unless he figures that out, NFL level defensive schemes are going to pick on him all day.
As a fellow Bruin fan…this is the correct answer
Google says  > The data transfer rate (DTR) is the amount of digital data that's moved from one place to another in a given time.  So I’m sold, I think data transfer rate should be picked 1st overall
Dorian Thompson-Robinson
Dason Tierre-Raul
Down to rimjob.
De’anthony Torrence-Rodriguez
[Dorian Thompson-Robinson](https://www.nfl.com/prospects/dorian-thompson-robinson/32005448-4f74-4868-ca39-079204531939)
Deep tendon reflex
You probably don't have a lot to add to the discussion...
So you’re saying he’s gonna be a pro bowler?
Nothing wrong with a Tyrod Taylor type ceiling. Still a boat load of money if you make it a career
Yeah, he seems like a mid/late round guy who'll at worst make the practice squad for a number of years, but likely end up as a backup to a team with a good QB situation.
IDK what you are basing this off of. Chip Kelly's offense absolutely asks the QB to make full field reads.      There is concensus on his arm being great & he actually had the best ball velocity out of the QBs that had it measured at the combine.
More mobile version of Dak with less arm strength. Good accuracy.
I mean it shows up on tape and I am not alone in the observation:  https://thedraftnetwork.com/sr-prospect/dorian-thompson-robinson-fc209c23-e1e9-4ec9-8d85-ab17a98aba81/  https://www.profootballnetwork.com/dorian-thompson-robinson-qb-ucla-nfl-draft-scouting-report-2023/  He also tied Josh Allen for the fastest ball velocity ever measured at the combine:  https://buffalonews.com/sports/bills/josh-allens-62-mph-throw-remains-nfl-scouting-combine-standard-but-he-has-company/article_b7b88648-bb70-11ed-b8e8-570581c7a694.html
Bing says   >Define the relationship DTR is an acronym that stands for "define the relationship"1234. It is used in chat and texting to imply a critical point in a relationship in which one person wants clear answers from the other23. The term is often used in Christian college campuses4. DTR can also refer to "Data Terminal Ready," which is a control signal in RS-232 serial communications5.
I'm not. OP is crazy. Data Transfer Rate might look good on tape but I doubt you get the same Data Transfer Rate in a completely different set up. Data Transfer Rate is way to system reliant to go 1st overall.
Looks as legitimate of a name as Bumper Pool.
Ik but I like reading discussions about draft prospects, and had no idea who it was because of the pointless acronym.
And you to add about adding to the discussion!
For the player, sure.  I don't think many teams want to draft a QB with Tyrod's ceiling, though.  It means you're OK for a few years and then you're looking for another QB.
Gardner Minshew's ball velocity was only 1 mph less than Justin Herbert's, it's really not that telling of arm strength. Minshew has one of the weakest arms in the NFL and Herbert has one of the best arms I've ever seen.
Pornhub says it’s just a video of someone’s feet
I wouldn't say pointless -- Dorian Thompson-Robinson was very often referred as DTR in the same way Robert Griffin III was RG3. OP should have spelled the name in the post though
I mean sure, but a pro bowl playoff QB in the 4th round is a steal
Actually why wouldn’t teams be super glad to grab a guy like that late in the draft? Get this guy in the day 3 area cheap contract solid backup for 4 years… teams need to do more to invest into the qb room. Not every guy is the next franchise guy but having a dependable backup or in the 49ers case 4 dependable backups is not a bad deal.
To someone who's not deeply plugged in, not knowing the acronym for a player who is consensus about a 5th/6th round pick isn't really a big huge thing.
Hunt, forever “what-if”. Would KC have beat the Patriots in the AFCCG had he played?
My father in law alway called Demetrius "Incompletrius Harris", but boy was that a catch.
Hunt was freakish in that offense. The guy couldn't be tackled and couldn't be covered.
Hunt was such a perfect fit for this offense.
He was insane on that offense.  Track team
Demetrius would let an easy catch bounce off his hands and then make all the dumbest this shouldn't be possible catches. Prime example is his TD (I think or maybe first down) in the Chiefs first game after cutting Hunt in Oakland. Mahomes put it low and away from where he was running, and he made an insane catch between 2 defenders.
so did i, he could only reliably catch balls in the endzone. ive always wondered if his issues were that he was thinking about what he was going to do after catching the ball instead of focusing on catching it
Dropmetrius Harris?
He was gonna be the first player in NFL history with 10 rushing and 10 receiving TDs in the same season; when he and Mahomes were together, they had twice as many games scoring 40+ points than they had games scoring <30 points.
The ol Dwayne Bowe special
Yeaaaaah son. He’s gonna sack a quarterback once and it’ll count as 5 sacks and then he’s gonna win us 5 Super Bowls in 1 season and then he’s gonna win 1st ballot hall of fame 3 times in a row. Let’s fucking go
He is an amazing interior DL.
Amazing troll job by him lmao
he is so damn good
4yr/$96M with $50M guaranteed. That’s my guess.  EDIT: Damn I was close. 4yr/$94M with $66M gtd. Chris Jones is gonna be so expensive 😄
THANK GOD WE DID SOMETHING RIGHT
I’m genuinely happy for Titans fans. That fanbase and Mike Vrabel deserve this.
Let’s go!!!!  Big Jeff is back!
Thank god..Tits Nation can relax a little now
LETS GOOOOOOOOO
Wanted this guy so bad in the draft and we took Ed Oliver SMH  Great signing by the Titans. Dude is a BEAST
Jeffery Simmons > Ben Simmons
Thinking Burns is next
Good move, you can’t let a guy like that go
Best news I’ve heard in a while! Been waiting for this deal for what feels like 2 years!
FUCK
Lol total 180 from the tweet he posted
JRob is gone! Alleluia!
Congrats Titans. He’s legit, only guy on their defense I really worry about each play.
I was so excited after his first tweet smh
Ah yes. The long haul of mediocrity.
>He's gonna win us 5 Super Bowls in 1 season   Still makes more sense than Todd Downing's play calls
username describes my feelings.
I'd guess a little higher, he's better than Daron Payne.
Damm close guess lol
Very impressive guess!
I’m guessing more. Particularly in the guaranteed department.
I’m preparing to give Quinnen my first born child
I was expecting 27 mil a year, so this is a steal and forces someone else like the Chiefs, Jets, and Giants to have to up the ante for Jones, Williams, and Lawrence.
Your FO actually spent money on good players 🥴
Unicorn Eagles fan?
Nah
Kiss all your tits today.
Ed Oliver is...pretty good though??
Apparently we can..
Dex seeing dollar signs right now
Idk how people get their hopes up for trade rumors. First of all, it’s possible they don’t get traded at all. Second of all, there are 30 other teams who the player could be traded to.
Robinson had his issues but historically he shelled out money for good players. He paid Henry, Lewan, Byard, Tannehill, Landry, Autry, etc. AJ was really the first big name he let go.
I think we definitely have a top 3 d line in the league now. Simmons, Tart, Autry, and Key is insane on paper.
In the last 20 years:   Superbowl Champs: CIN 0, TEN 0  Winning Seasons: CIN 9, TEN 9  Playoff Wins: CIN 5, TEN 5  Win PCT: CIN .469, TEN .514  Maybe sit this one out, champ?
Can confirm
Ow, my heart.
https://media.tenor.com/sym0G74VpCAAAAAC/rick-and-morty-this-guy-gets-it.gif
Shit I didn’t realize Payne got almost $60M gtd
Honestly I hated that contract for WAS  They paid for the sack total, Payne basically had identical pressure numbers but like double the sacks + there’s a decent argument he’s not top 3 on that D line
Yeah I’ve been saying if we can extend Jones for $28M AAV or less then I’ll call that a win.
They fucked it up last year with AJ, so you never know
Flair did not check out
Your gm is gonna deal jj just like you did to diggs in 3 years to the titans for a first round pick. Im calling it
Oliver is probably above average. But when you factor in he was picked before Jeffrey Simmons, Dexter Lawrence, and Christian Wilkins it doesn't look good. Oliver is worse than all three of them. He can do well when someone like Von Miller is drawing all the attention but he is not nearly the game wrecker those three can be.
Not trade, this means his deal sets the market so our DT is gonna get more.
I do agree with you but he let Conklin walk too
AJ was far from the only good player dismissed under jrobb's tenure.
Y’all already forgetting Landry exists smh.
Well listen, I wouldn’t go that far. It’s a good one though. I would say upper half, but no one is intimidating outside of Simmons.  You got lines like 9ers, chargers, cowboys, bills, Steelers up top.
I hate to agree with a colts fan but that's a bit too high, maybe top 3 against the run I'd give you. Even with key We're still gonna have the same struggle as last year with qbs that can move around, our guys are great at beating blocks can't keep up with those out of the box playmakers like teams with elite edge players can.
I know! These DT contracts are going to be interesting
Aaron Donald broke the IDL market. He’s getting 31m AAV.
I get Allen but who are the other 2? Young has been thoroughly disappointing and Sweat while being solid isn’t exactly a gamewrecker.
New FO, Ran knew that if he fucked up a deal with Simmons people would compare it to JRob fucking up with AJ and he'd be in the dog house before his first season started. This deal was gonna get done.
Philly was hoping for Simmonds too lol. Good Signing, guy is a monster.
Right? Why would we dislike the titans lol I have no qualms with them and Vrabel is an awesome coach who's easy to respect.
And then they’ll draft an even better receiver with that pick?
I don't know about Wilkins being better. Plus Ed is still younger.
Upside is he plays in Tennessee where taxes are low so he isn’t getting some grossly upper adjusted deal like a NYC or CA player would need.
Giants had one good season and have walked into multiple contract minefields.
Technically Landry is a LB is why I didn't list him
There’s still 3 to go as well - Quinnen Williams, Dexter Lawrence and Chris Jones are all eligible to be extended and will have good arguments to be around 25M per.
I don't know if Milk Sauce is a Titans fans, but Titans fans have victim complexes and eagles have a lot of trolls, so when the AJB trade happened, there has been a lot of gloating from those eagles fans that rubbed a lot of Titans fans the wrong way.
Lots of Titans fans dislike the Eagles and Eagles’ fans for everyone clowning on the Titans over the AJB trade. They assume the feeling is mutual back.
Yes but they’ll sign kirk cousins to a 10 year extension
I know it's just numbers but statistically Wilkins [comes out on top](https://stathead.com/tiny/DhlyE)
Dexter Lawrence is one of the best DL in the league. It has nothing to do with how many wins the team got. He played extremely well and is going to get paid like it.
If you’re including key, you gotta include Landry lmao.
They will all be in Simmons ballpark. There are so many great IDL right now.
Anyone who blames the Eagles for taking that deal is a fucking moron. They didn’t kidnap AJ.
Looks to me like Ed gets to the QB a lot more.
I don’t think it’s really *blame* as much as disliking them because of the way a former player went over and balled out and rubbed it in the face of his previous team. It’s more like jealousy I’d say?
Well looks like he was trolling. Followed up with this: https://twitter.com/grindsimmons94/status/1644413648692027403?s=46&t=OhhHKJxGu2EFLIQlp5ompA
Look at his next tweet    https://twitter.com/grindsimmons94/status/1644413648692027403?s=46&t=uZRGZvE1bFBFZ6_ZSxGpDQ
Him trolling is hilarious.
Please not again
Cardinals?    Edit. 😭
Well deserved. Hopefully it’s fully guaranteed because he’s earned it
What a freaking troll job!
Lol, nice troll job
This guy is a monster. Whoever gets him should praise the lord
Cards for pick 3……..
This almost sounds like he's leaving?
Please be lions
Titans Nation just doesn’t sound right
He’s a Cowboy
Probably worked out the extension he wanted.
Ultimate troll
Buddys late for April fools
They got us in the 1st half, not gonna lie.
If he's staying why is he Looking For Group? ;-)
lol hilarious  Happy for Titans fans
So worth paying the $$$ for. He was just a brilliant pick that fully lived up to all the hype and basically stepped onto the field halfway through that rookie season as an elite dlineman when he should have been still recovering.
If he's traded right now as part of a trade up, that would be the only one to make sense.
Well, he's going back to the Titans it looks like.   Signed to a 4 year 96 million dollar contract extension
Followed up with another tweet saying there’s a lot more work to do with a Titans game clip. Sounds more like an extension is done or is almost done.
Sometimes I just walk into the office and thank everyone enigmatically.
It's not
He’s a Titan.
Also worked out a heart attack from me
2 first and Jeffrey Simmons would be fine with me
lol I’m sure it would.
It almost definitely wouldn't be Jeff + comp for 3.  It would most likely be straight up.
Incorrect. Tampa did as well if you are only counting cities with 1 team for each. New York is having everyone of their teams make it except for the Jets
Dammit Sharks get your shit together
Just the opposite in Motown!
SuperSonics dropping the ball here.
Lmao this isn't even remotely true  NY- Giants, Rangers, Yankees (Mets too)   TB- Bucs, Lightning, Rays
That's noting! OAKLAND will soon be the 1st city to lose all 3 Sports Franchises!
Giants, Yankees (Mets), Rangers?
Four once the Sonics make it.
Go Kings Go 👑
Seattle's accomplishment in this would be more impressive: LA has two teams in each sport, so...more chances to win.
I need Washington to do this...
The Bay Area one year had the giants, 49ers, warriors, and sharks all make it. I know different cities but they are all intertwined together.
What about New york? Giants made the giants made the playoffs
Wait, didn’t the Yankees, Mets, rangers, Giants and Knicks make the playoffs?
Damn Sounders miss the playoffs 1 time and it's this one.
To be fair LA has 2 football teams 2 baseball teams and 2 hockey teams.
H I S T O R I C
Fuck off Lefko mf Seahawks didn’t make shit
What about their NBA team? They’re making the playoffs, right?
Til there’s a seattle kraken
Bring it back to 2010-2011 when the Bears made the NFCCG, the Bulls made the ECF, the Blackhawks won the Stanley cup, and maybe the white sox made the playoffs if I recall correctly?
How about their NBA team?
What about nba seattle
That’s impressive because The Kraken only become a team like 3 years ago?
Tampa had a Super Bowl, World Series trip, Stanley Cup and NBA final trip if you want to give them Miami in a few month span in 2020. Co-owners with LA in all of sports in 20-21.
The guy didn't include Tampa and NYC because they don't play literally within the city limit.  SoFi isn't in LA but that doesn't matter to him I guess.
Yeah this is just downright wrong lmfao
Oddly enough them getting their shit together now could be detrimental
The Karlsson revival has been fun to watch, though. I’m hoping Miro gets the Norris but man it’s hard for me to pass up what Karlsson has done this year (albeit on a much worse team)
They want Bedard.
Wait till they get Bedard.
San Jose and Santa Clara aren't in San Francisco so they apparently wouldn't count on this list
DC Sports has entered the chat
*Seattle fans glaring at OKC*
Thunder still have a chance to make the playoffs.
Giants aren’t in New York lol
Giants play in East Rutherford and the Rays play in St. Petersburg.   So it’s technically correct that it’s the only city that has those in the post season.
But not the Jets.
And Knicks!
Islanders?
Glad that a Seattle fan said it first. I immediately thought to myself "yeah, but what about the NBA...oh....oh yeah, touchy subject"
But also twice as many chances to lose *(taps finger on head)*         Literally no added value to your comment but seems right if you don't think about it
Washington just did this….Seattle, Washington that is.
We’re looking at some lean times ahead when the football team is probably on the best footing to compete for anything. The Nats are nearly unwatchable
Giants are from New Jersey
:(
This is their second season. But the NHL has a very balanced expansion draft. Seattle and Vegas both are strong teams already.
The Champa Bay era. What a fucking year.
Why would give them the Heat when Miami has a separate NFL and NHL team? Blasphemous tbh
Hardcore west coast bias for sure. Make up ridiculous and unnecessary qualifications to remove the east coast teams that accomplished this only to realize the same standard actually eliminates one of the west coast areas too lol.  For what’s it worth, I like being on the west coast way more than the east but c’mon. Not only did Tampa sports do this too, but we’ve done it three years in a row with three championships and five conference championships over that period.
Um Rams don't play in LA
Those 7/8 points really fucked us. I’m hoping all our previous bad luck will be avenged in the lottery
Karlsson is probably getting traded in the offseason.
Greetings, brother.
Chargers play in Inglewood, not LA so the original tweet still isn't correct
East Rutherford is in the NYC metro area.  They're called the Tampa BAY Rays, not the Tampa Rays.  Sports teams nowadays go by regions/metros, not just the city.
And Nets and Devils literally everyone but the Jets
Not yet!
Came here to ask about the Sonics playoff hopes...Reddit has made me realize I'm not as clever as I think I am
Pain
Yeah the Nats lost 1-0 to the Rockies yesterday 💀, The Caps won't be going back to the playoffs for at least a couple years, the Wizards are mediocre asf but they might squeak in, in the near future hopefully.   At least the Defenders are good.
And the Rams are from Inglewood, Commanders are from Maryland, Cowboys are from Arlington, Bills are from Orchard Park, etc.  Who gives a shit if the Giants play in a suburb. It's the NYC metro
Past 12 years of bolts hockey has been wild, man. Absolute monster of an organization now.
Magic are much closer tbh
Inglewood is in LA County at least? Seems pretty arbitrary though.
Yuup. It you’re going to throw out a smug ass tweet like this, at least do a modicum of research
West coast is the bomb. How are people sitting down to SNF at like 830? Poor bastards
Seattle people do this shit all the time.  “Only Seattle has xyz, we’re the best” - and it’s rarely based in reality.  It’s weirdly ignorant for a city that prides itself on calling people ignorant.  - source : from Seattle
I know? I said that their stadium *isn't* in LA.
Having 22 wins and not even being in last thanks to all the ot losses is kind of infuriating
Send him to Edmonton 😈
Inglewood is part of Los Angeles.
Still Seattle is the only city to host three teams. So still technically correct.
Devils don't count, they only rep NJ.
Pain
Mostly I’m rooting for Ovie to break the record and the Nats to get sold
Ok then fuck LA just Seattle has done it🤷‍♂️
Idk about the other ones but Orchard Park is a suburb of Buffalo. Jersey is a totally different state.
Nope. Jersey
This would be big news to the city of Inglewood. Someone might want to tell the Inglewood mayor and city council.
SoFi is in Inglewood
The Rams and Chargers don’t technically play in LA
Which is irrelevant.
Not for this stat but most Devils fans are also fans of the Yankees Mets Giants and Jets so it’s nice to see everyone thriving in our intertwined rooting interests
Same, also i'm rooting for the Orioles.
It’s closer to NYC than the 49ers stadium is to San Francisco
East Rutherford is closer to Manhattan than Orchard Park is to Buffalo
NJ is an NYC suburb.
They are fully aware they are part of Los Angeles county.
So they wouldn't be included either.  Not that complicated, guys.
>Seattle and LA are the only **cities** to …
That could be any ewok
Honestly if Bengals could get Zeke pretty cheap and get a young RB in the draft that could work out really well for them.   Bringing in Zeke for his pass blocking alone has value. I know Bengals have been making moves to protect Burrow but I can’t imagine they are content yet.
Also I don’t think this is the Bengals facility.
Over/under 10 zeke being a center jokes.  (Edit: Lines changing to 25.)
Zeke averaged 3.79 ypc last year and Mixon was at 3.9. basically the same player but less menacing
That...is not the Bengals facility
Would love if they signed him. Probably not til after the draft though.
Brent Callaway, the person tagged here, is the Vice President and coach of EXOS Sports in Frisco, Texas.   Frisco is the city that the Cowboys practice facility is in  I’m pretty sure Zeke and Chase also have the same agent   I don’t think this clip means anything at all tbh
Get rid of shooter joe
Zeke and T Williams would be a good combo
Zeke is in his Russell Westbrook arc. When he’s paid like a top ten player in the league it’s a big problem for the team because of how much potential value he is keeping off the team without producing. When he’s on a much cheaper contract he’ll probably be more valuable than 90% of players available for that price.
Sweet as a KC fan I can only hope that they sign his wore out ass.😁
We need a good blocker like we had in Perine. If he can come in block, get some shorty yard conversions and maybe catch a few out of the backfield I’m all for it.
Do the bengals need a center that bad?
I would very much like this if the price is right. Perfect replacement for perine, cut Mixon, get a RB day 2 in the draft.
I didn't knew y'all needed a new center.
Cinci decided they needed a more popular mixon
He’s gonna be the highest paid FB in the league this year
That was the best white boy griddy I've seen in awhile
Zeke deserves a ring.  Sign him
New starting center for cincy
Makes sense. Zeke is beloved in Ohio.
The fall off for Zeke was fast
Damn :(
Bengals fans are you ready for short gains and horrible attempts at breaking tackles
I assume he signs there. Still wondering why the Mixon cut is taking so long.
Damn Ezekiel Elliot is a spy!
I would love this for Zeke bro. Joe would LOVE him. QBs best friend right there
Of course he moves back to Ohio
See if he speaks Yub Nub
i know we joking but damn zeke is so ugly with that combo of head hair and beard…just too much  like shave ONE
I want to upvote you so badly but I can’t be your 70th upvote
That really makes a lot of sense, extra protection for Burrow.
Just not his oline skills
That's basically Samaje Perine's role from last year, as I understand it. Good power runner with excellent pass blocking. If they get themselves one of these freaky fast RB's in the draft, well baby, you got a stew going.
Why draft? Aggregating menacing is like a lesser fine than making contact with a ref in a pre season game
This is Samarje Perine erasure
If he signs - Zeke will be the bane of Mixon owners next year
I hear he is a pretty good center too
Yeah, unless the Bengals are partnered with EXOS or something then he's probably at the performance institute in Frisco, TX.
You’re right, looks like they’re inside
Over
I've only scrolled down to your comment so far, and I've already seen 3.
In the first 5 minutes? Still over
Zeke averaged 4.2 YPC before Steele went down and his workload was: 20% short yardage and 38% shotgun draws. No one is going to have a great average with that workload, but he still has plenty left in the tank!  Zeke is honestly a good fit with CIN, and you guys would be lucky to have him. I'm still kind of salty he's not a Cowboy anymore.
Mixon is also not too good at pass blocking
Anyone signing Zeke at this point is begrudgingly accepting that his limited running ability makes him pretty much just a short yardage runner, with the excitement of what he brings in pass protection.  IDK how well you've followed the NFL, but the Bengals would really enjoy better pass protection from pretty much every participant and Zeke was way better at it than Mixon has ever been.
Zeke would be replacing Perine, not Mixon. Whole Zeke isn't the runner he used to be, he's still one of the best in the league at his position in pass blocking. That makes him useful as a 3rd down/passing down back. That was Perine's role.  Mixon's replacement is in the draft
Zeke was playing through a pretty nasty bone bruise he suffered against the lions.   The last 2 seasons he has actually started off really well, he has just toughed it out through knee injuries that required him to wear a brace.    He still has juice, and has the toughness to play regardless of injury
I think where Zeke provides and upgrade is pass pro though
The issue with Zeke is our coaches haven't grasped on to the fact that he doesn't have the legs to handle 15+ carries a game for an entire season any more. You can watch his first 3-4 games in 2021-2022 and the first few games from last year and there's a clear difference in speed / burst. He's also consistently getting dinged up but plays through it.   If you guys sign him and keep him in the 5-10 carry range, 3rd and short and pass block, he's a phenomenal RB2 behind another workhorse back. He's also an amazing locker room guy.
Once they cut mixon, Zeke will sign there
I’d love it too
Figurative shooter Joe? Or literal shooter Joe?
I’d take Evans over Williams when he’s healthy
Zeke had 12 TDs last year, and a lot of that was from short-yardage.     People are sleeping on him. Yes, he is not the burner he once was, but he also lost about 30% of his normal carries to Pollard. Not to mention Kellen Moore took Zeke from a perennial top RB in the NFL and reduced him to mostly pass protection with some running.     Zeke got what he did inspite of KM, not because of him.     Had he kept his regular carries, he would have been a top 5 RB in the league last year. That is with his 3.8 ypc.  Zeke is, and always has been, a downhill runner. Get him in space, give the ball in stride, and he can make things happen for you. I dont know about ripping off a 70 yard wheel route, but he can for sure get you 30-40 still in the right situation.
He has a built in fanbase here too from his OSU days. There’s not as much sheer overlap as the Browns/OSU fanbase but there’s still a vocal contingent who’s gonna absolutely love if they sign Zeke.
Runningbacks are lucky to stay in their prime after 7 years. Was it really all that fast? Dude gave all he had in his body to the Cowboys
Couldn’t think of another team I’d rather see him go to tho 🥲
I’m ready to have an adequate blocker at the RB position and a viable short yardage 3rd down back, while drafting a rookie RB
Quit being like you are
Man, I still regret not buying [this Christmas sweater](https://www.geekalerts.com/star-wars-ewok-christmas-sweater/) I saw a few years ago.
Not to me, I’d be happy to grab either one!
We can help you get there the other way!
Zeke as center has never allowed a sack tho has he?
):
Man, why you gotta kick a guy who already got steamrolled?
/r/Angryupvote
Your user name is awesome.
He gone
This isn’t a fantasy football sub. If Bengals cut Mixon, the only owners that need to worry about him would be the owner of the team who picks him up.
Com’on man, that’s a LeRoy Hoard quote
*post about Zeke*  r/NFL: he played center hehe he played center center he played he played center hehehe
I think there is one in Columbus Ohio as well.
Probably a terrible line
I’ve seen a lot of people say this and it’s selling me. If he was Mixon for less money I’ll take it, anything more would be great. Cut Mixon, sign Zeke, draft a more dynamic rookie. That would satisfy me
Yup. People really look at the last few weeks of Zeke’s last season, but the run offense as a whole really dropped after Steele went down. Even Pollard’s numbers took a dive the last few weeks
I can't agree more with this comment, upvoted but had to comment too. Zeke is not what he was he was way overpaid, but he still has plenty in the tank to be on an NFL team. His YPC has been down partly due to how he was used and playing with knee injuries the last few years. Yes he's lost some burst, but not as bad as people want to make out. Happy Dallas cut him cause he was expensive, wouldn't be mad if he ended up back in Dallas on like a $2m deal. That's highly unlikely though.
yeah while i thought zeke was over paid and it was rough not seeing him break tackles he used to or get to the edge like pollard could but with pollard breaking his leg and and how good zeke was at pass protecting i'm worried about that position.
It’ll be funny seeing the tide turn on here about Zeke when he puts up a similar season but now everyone “surprisingly” sees his value and likes him.
Zeke is incredibly underrated on Reddit. It's amazing how people look at aggregate stats for a player they don't watch and think that paints the whole picture.
You're just getting meme responses but Zeke is incredible in pass protection
Zeke has offensive line experience as well
Good thing Zeke’s second position is center
This was a joke about how Mixon has a menacing charge and Zeke does not, but somehow no one who replied has picked up on it
MCDC warned everyone they’d be biting Kneecaps. Zeke didn’t think he meant it literally.
I really wish McCarthy had just shut him down. He was looking really good before that PCL tear 2 years ago.
We need a short yardage and pass blocking specialist
This is the way.
>our coaches haven't grasped on to the fact that he doesn't have the legs to handle 15+ carries a game for an entire season any more  Moore isnt here anymore.
Yeah I questioned it at first but I’m sold if they bring him in for that role at like $5M
Tbf do we actually know where Burrow was on November 22, 1963?
I don’t know why you’re downvoted, you are correct. I got you  Source: OSU fan in Ohio. There are more OSU/Browns fans than OSU/Cinci fans. It’s a scientific fact
Yall ain't running the ball with Joe and that trio of WRs. Stick anybody back there who cares lol.
Ignore him our fans suck and take on personal vendettasa against players. Zeke is still elite at short yardage situations and pass protection, he isn't as washed as bitter/scorned fans will tell you
Oh my god I was the chosen one
100% pressure rate tho
There needs to be a FOLATPGHBAWB stat. Fell over like a tooth pick getting hit by a wrecking ball.
I like you
You’re getting downvoted but you’re right. I remember back in the day fantasy talk wouldn’t fly lol
They only have the performance institute in 3 spots (FL, AZ, TX) but they have other locations elsewhere.  But I'm still not seeing any OH locations on here.  https://www.teamexos.com/location/contact
Much like any line with Zeke at center
Zeke can’t be a featured back anymore, but he still has a lot of value in a committee
It solves a big problem for you guys. Zeke is still a good runner, he is a very good in pass pro, and he is definitely capable of taking a swing pass and making something out of it as the WRs clear space.   He’s do it all IMO but just can’t be the only guy doing it anymore if that makes sense. Perine is pretty good but I do think that a quicker change of pace back is still more ideal to pair with Zeke just to provide a different type of look.   Either way it’s basically Mixon for less.
Keep goin I'm almost there
Oh yeah. Pollard was the #1 RB in terms of efficiency last year and even he only averaged 3.6 per carry after Steele went down.   Zeke isn't washed. He's not 2016 Zeke any more, but he still has plenty left to contribute to an NFL team.
I think anytime we acknowledge that a RB has lost a step it’s the beginning of the end. And not a “grind out a few more seasons” end but a drop off a cliff, completely washed type of end. Cin should give him one year guaranteed, but anything else is crazy.
Don't worry, Jerry always has a plan.   Except when it comes to his illegitimate children.
I mean at the 4mil range, he is valuable.
Such an original joke!
RB/ Center flex versatility 😭
It certainly was an experience
I did, just seemed like the meat of your comment was a more serious comparison between the two.
Then there's absolutely no reason for Zeke to not be a Bengal next year. Just pray that you don't need him to be your RB1 at the tail end of the season.
He'd be perfect for that
What do you pay a guy that can't touch a ball more than 5 times a game? A million?
And neither is Zeke. I was purely speaking on these last few years. Not going forward lol.
The void.
I believe maybe the best blocking rb in the league would help that
We have to run the ball well, otherwise it’s 2 high  shells for the entire season.
>Yall ain't running the ball with Joe and that trio of WRs.  Bengals definitely run the ball & it's always extremely predictable when they are.
Sorry, talking about Zeke or our o line?
Ultimate boom or bust guy it sounds like
They're in Arizona, he's with Ja'marr from what I've read.
Insider gambling
Emmitt was one of the few (only) backs that had a steady decline. After 1995 he wasn't great but seemed to be good for 1200 to 1300 yards and 10 to 12 tubs.
>Except when it comes to his illegitimate children.   That’s Jerruh’s greatest plan. buy the baby momma a house, provide her ton of child support, and just expect them to not admit he’s the daddy in public.
I don’t disagree but this sub has overwhelmingly called him trash and washed and he’d be lucky to sign anywhere and that’s just all flat out wrong.
This will definitely move him up a round or two in next year's drafts
Twas but a setup for the punchline
It probably wouldn’t be worse than what’d we had. We were using our RB2 as RB1 because Mixon can’t pass block
Hopefully if we do need him to be number 1 his lower workload during the season might keep him fresh
If the Bengals used him in the Samaje Perine role of pass blocking and short yardage runs, I’ve seen like $3-4M projected
2nd string RB money, I guess. Far cry from what he was making.
Well, if youre anything like me, the reassurance helps with the PTSD.
Yes.
engineer gaming
Marcus Allen also put up some good seasons later in his career.
This is social media, pal. Either they're the fucking GOAT, or should be a backup in the XFL.
Lol imagine wasting your quarterback’s rookie deal
I would simply win the Super Bowl every year I had a QB on a rookie contract
Hiring Lombardi sure didn’t help.
Chargers are the cowboys of the AFC. Annually disappointing
27-0 lives on I guess
The cheap rookie deal is the only way to win narrative is ridiculous.
Yeah that's cause Staley ain't it.
Thanks, this is *definitely* not the fifteen-thousandth time someone's said this
I mean, look at the OC they gave him. Dude neuters every QB he touches.
People put way too much stock in a QB being on a rookie deal
The Chargers are the NFL version of that old movie/tv show cliche of when you stop one leak, another appears and then you fix that one and another one appears and so on.
Winning super bowls is hard
 Chargers easily the most disappointing team imo. Especially after getting embarrassed by Jags.   My buddy is a die hard fan, I’ve been saying Staley is a problem and he thinks he’s not at all, but I don’t see how you have that many issues with that much talent. Now it’s about to get way harder to pay talent.
But how many times has Burrow scored 30 points in a playoff game? Checkmate.
Tom telesco should be on the hot seat imo
What is the point of this observation
Considering Tua's record is only 23-13, the Chargers totally got 3 more wins *and 11 more losses* out of Herbert.  Joe Burrow is 24-17-1 with a trip to the superbowl.  Herbert still has more wins *and losses.*  Jalen Hurts is 23-11 with a superbowl trip as well.  Justin Herbert is the winningest *and losingest* QB of his draft class.
Derek Carr 2.0
I have a feeling that this isn’t the fault of Herbert either.
Teams that won with rookie qb deals pre wage scale since 2000 Patriots, Steelers, Giants, ravens, packers, since rookie wage scale Chiefs, Seahawks, Eagles. Make of that what you will.
20 years later and Eli Manning still made the right decision
Chargers and wasting elite QB play.
Shouldn't have hired a defensive coordinator. Brandon whateverhisnameis hasn't done anything to further Herbert's career.
And they are actively pissing off the few decent players around him.
pain  my herby deserves better :(
None of this matters. Her--Bert is top 7 QB in the NFL, imo he's 4th. He needs new WRs & a less talented rb than Austin eKeler.
That is some sharp analysis.
Justin Herbert is starting to get some hate but I still believe he's gonna a championship contender at some point. Idk I'm not giving up on him.
We know
In those 4 years they rank bottom 3 in defense.
Patrick Mahomes literally just won the Super Bowl on a massive deal
leave us alone, will ya? we don't have that much going for us so just let us be sad in our little corner
This whole “you have to win with a QB on a rookie deal” narrative is so dumb. The vast majority of Super Bowls are won by teams with QBs not on rookie deals. If you’re in the position to take a franchise QB in the draft, it means your team probably sucks and it’ll most likely take a few years to build around them.
Didn’t they fire their athletic training staff or something after the season? If they can manage to stay healthy that would make a big difference for them
Since the contract ends after this year, all they have to do is simply win a Super Bowl this year and then they can release him so they don't have to pay the big bucks on a 2nd contract?   Sounds like a solid plan.
The chargers are such one of the most frustrating teams, based entirely on the times I’ve watched them play. Since the Rivers they could hang tough with high level teams and somehow pull out a loss. Herbert seems to be the same way. God I miss seeing Phillip just “aww shucking” and “ga’ll darning” his receivers while flopping around on the field like a soccer player.
Guess its shit on the Chargers day.  Ignore the dumpster fire taking place behind me.
It's the terrible coach for sure
Because their coach thinks he’s smarter than football.
A lot of similarities to Stafford, other than the cheap rookie deal…
The Chargers really are gonna waste this great young QB, arent they?
Staley should have been fired when Mike Williams got injured in a literal meaningless game
The most overrated team every year
Now show the defensive stats for those 3 years. No QB gets less help from the defense / has less margin for error than Herbert. Other QBs can throw a pick and still win 55% of their games, but for Herbert it drops to something insane like 29%
It's the curse of Marty Schottenheimer.
Wins are a tough metric to use on a QB, but you do have to win right?
Yes, having a QB on a rookie deal helps with cap space, but history shows it's honestly not very important.   These are the 6 teams since 2000 that have won a Superbowl with their QB on a rookie contract.  •Tom Brady with the Patriots in the 2001 season(it's Tom fucking Brady...)  •Ben Roethlisberger with the Steelers in 2005(went 15-1 with their Rookie QB the year before)  •Eli Manning for the Giants in 2007(good example)  •Wilson in 2013(good example)  •Wentz in 2017(was not the starter in the playoffs/SB)  •Mahomes in 2019(team went 12-4 the year before with Alex Smith, also signed a new contract months after the SB)
We’ve squandered worse.
Now tell us about the other 2 QBs that were in that draft. I didn’t see the jags running out to sign Trevor after throwing a dozen interceptions in his comeback win.
These cheap owners are going to get a wake up call I feel
This is literally Drew Brees
Fellas I hate to say this but winning is hard
Herbert seems like the type of dude to take a cut.
yeah, no shit Sharp.
Having a rookie contract QB is such a huge advantage maybe the Chiefs should try it
They're easily the worst football team in LA.
Chargers catching strays over Easter.
What playing for the Chargers is like in one tweet:
Poorly ran team
Stop with the rookie deal shit its really not a big deal
And yet most super bowls are won with QBs not on their rookie contract. This logic is stupid
We will give you Love for Herbert
I’ve always liked the Chargers. I feel for the fan base. Having so many truly great players and getting so damn close. Brutal. Hope Herbert stays and eventually gets them one. Also, the powder blue jerseys are the best in all sports.
The chargers wasted prime Gates, LT, and Rivers. Wasting Herbert is child's play in comparison. This is light work for them. I'd feel bad for them if not for Spanos being such an unbelievable piece of shit.
It’s almost like you need a real coach to win games and having a star QB isn’t enough
Wait so by the standards people have put on Kyler, clearly Herbert hasn't done shit and shouldn't be getting paid a big guaranteed deal??
If Herbert were smart he would just refuse to resign with the Chargers. They wasted so many other talented careers because they are fucking useless as an organization. They don’t even play their football in the right city anymore!
It's amazing how we used to say "Let them sit a couple years to learn" to "Damn they didn't win a SB in his first 5 years in the league.. they're screwed"
Now they’re gunna possibly lose Ekeler
Thanks for all of the snarky comments guys, really good stuff. Sorry we are talking about football in the football subreddit.   It’s worth pointing out that the Chargers haven’t done anything with Herbert, even during the period of his career where it is easiest to build around. These are the exact kind of things I would be looking at before giving a guy a bank breaking contract, which is probably what it will take to extend him.   Do the Chargers want to commit to 5-6 years of this, or do they have to take a huge step back and evaluate their franchise (not just Herbert, but everything)? I don’t think option 2 is ridiculous given their lack of success.
Chargers gunna charger
1st year: Herbert had Lynn as his HC and everyone thought the Chargers drafted an automatic bust, only for him to have arguably the greatest rookie QB season ever. Not on him.  2nd year: Led the Chargers to a top 5 offense and clearly progressed. We saw what he could do with a healthy offensive cast and functioning rib cartilage. However, the Chargers defense and STs were dog shit which led to an incredibly narrow playoffs miss.  3rd year: Defense was still dogshit. STs was actually good. Slew of injuries to the offense (Keenan, Mike, Slater, Pipkins and Linsley had on-and-off injuries). Herbert also had fractured rib cartilage and a torn-labrum on his left shoulder. Lombardi went full Lombardi and made Herbert pass an average of 40 times a game despite his injuries. His dumbass HC played Mike Williams in a meaningless game where the 5th seed was already gift-wrapped to them. Sounds like an insurmountable task for Herbert to make a deep playoff run with all that shit.
Yea well you left out the part about Brandon Staley blowing one playoff chance against the raiders last year then choking this year against the jags. He low key is the worst coach in the NFL.
Not surprising to see the Chargers ruin another QB
Maybe he’s not as good as everybody seems to think is
BAWHGAWD IS THAT TANNEHILL'S SUCCESSOR?!
Herbert and the Chargers get talked about on this sub like Super Bowl Contenders, and he has the same playoff* resume as Mac Jones
Classic Tom Telesco shit. Chargers wasted Rivers too.
Best preseason champs ever!
If I’m Herbert I don’t play for that coach/ front office until a large amount of money is guaranteed. It’s simply disrespectful and egregious that they let/ forced him to play so hurt. They don’t give a shit about his health. The dude isn’t egotistic but he should have the brain to recognize that he needs to secure his future.
Yet everyone keep mentioning his name amongst the greats.
He’s not as good as advertise
It's everyone's fault except for Herbert at Chargerland.
Wow imagine
WE LOVE TO SEE IT GET FUCKED CHARGERS AND CHARGERS FANS
It's kind of embarrassing. Their biggest problem has always been depth, but it should have been way better planned for when you know all your best guys are gonna miss games at some point in the season. On paper, this is such a solid starting roster, but I really think they need to move on from Allen and Williams and get what they can for them now.   Availability is the best ability, and their starters are simply just never available.
Ayyy as many trips to playoffs as us 😤
*Jerry Seinfeld voice*: “That’s a shame.”
If Herbert is smart he'll leave the Chargers. I'd love to see him play for McVay but the Rams are stuck with Stafford.
I think there’s too much emphasis on winning with a rookie deal QB. That being said, the Chargers have failed to build a complete team around Herbert on his rookie deal, doing it when he’s a $50m guy is going to be even harder. I fully believe Herbert can take them to the Super Bowl but they really need to fix some glaring holes on that roster first.
They should have the record for team injuries during that time though.  That team is snake bit
The Vikings will get you out of the mess you are in with Herbert.
Ha DC4 part two.
Having a good QB on their rookie contract is definitely a good thing, but its importance has gotten way overblown recently.  **Only 4 times in the last 20 years has the Super Bowl been won by a QB on their rookie contract** - [Mahomes, Russ, Flacco, and Big Ben (his first SB)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Super_Bowl_starting_quarterbacks).   Edit: missed one
Probably two appearances if staley doesnt take that timeout in the raiders game
All these years later, this type of situation and example continues to make me recognize there's an extra layer of ability and office management and understanding to success in the NFL. And therefore Archie Manning knew exactly what the fuck he was doing on draft day.
We’ll take him
Kellen Moore is going to change the whole trajectory of Justin Herbert's career and the Los Angeles chargers franchise.
herbert gonna win 3 super bowls in his career. mark my words.
It’s funny because every year they get hyped up just to shit the bed in the most embarrassing way possible. Love to see it.
It’s very hard to do it because when you have a rookie qb good enough to start on his rookie deal they usually aren’t on good teams. that being said the bengals were trash took burrow in the same year and made a Super Bowl and 2 afc championships. The chargers are wasting these cheap Herbert year. The ravens also wasting Lamar cheap years, which is weird because they didn’t waste Flaccos. And Lamar is a better qb than Flacco was
Amazing how he got a pass for blowing a 27 point lead
But people say he’s the same as Mahomes. That’s the narrative right?  Nobody wants to go to the AFC west because you have to play Herbert and Mahomes twice every year
That's because chargers FO/Coaching is horrible. They pay injured people all the money, and start their starters in meaningless games. Hope Justin gets out before his career is wasted like Gates, Rivers, Tomlinson, Ekeler, Weddle, Etc. etc  so on and so on
Herbert doesn’t have that dog in him. He doesn’t have the fire that people rally around.   At least from the perspective of a know-nothing fan, who likes Herbert.
The constant injuries to his top WRs doesn’t help.  He also is in the same division as Mahomes.
The best part is going to be when they decide not to pick up his option and he goes somewhere else and wins a couple Lombardis.
Herbert needs to go somewhere that will actually allow him to flourish. He has the potential to be arguably top 3 in the league right now
Eli Manning was so smart to refuse to play for the Chargers.
he’s good but has to take his responsibility as part of the issues
Herbert ain't it.
Can someone tell me if Ekeler actually called Herbert long hair Matt Ryan after they lost to us?
Overrated ass QB
So we should trade Herbert to the Panthers, got it.
2 trips to the playoffs....
Imagine drafting your franchise QB before the 7th round
Maybe Herbert isn’t good?
If they can't win in the playoffs with their QB making chump change, what makes anyone here convinced they can when he's making 50M a year? Herbert is not an elite QB that can carry the team in the playoffs and never will be.
Anything is better than Philip Rivers dumb face.
Overrated
Kirk Cousins > Justin Herbert
Damn you're right... they should trade him
For once, we are the ones who used a rookie deal QB to damn near a SB win.
I remember when everyone was down talking burrow and up talking herbert, how the situation has now changed
I remember how people would talk down on Burrow and overhype herbert How the tables have turned 😂
Ruiz still thinks he’s a better QB than Burrow😂😂😂
Media was so ready to make him a thing
Herbert is walking proof of how overvalued arm strength is in NFL QB’s. Guy is mediocre at best in literally every other category.
I thought Herbert was overrated in college, think he’s overrated in the NFL as well. Then again I don’t follow the chargers as much as I follow the Steelers sooo…..
Easily the most overrated QB in the last decade, if not ever.
It is undeniable how much of an advantage it is to have a QB on a rookie deal. Seahawks with Russ, Chiefs with Mahomes (although doesn’t matter now since they won.) But ya they gotta take advantage, seems this is their window, with a seemingly aging roster a bit. Allen is getting up there in age, so is Mack, Ekeler is an unknown after this offseason.
Yeah they should probably let him walk when his rookie deal is up.
Just want to know. How many teams in Superbowl era have won a Superbowl with a rookie deal QB
Tyler “Warren Sharp” Brickner making a brilliant point here
Fuck warren sharp
Not even a chargers fan but sharp has gotten progressively more annoying the past 2-3 years
Teams need to move on from head coaches faster.
Lol
Hey do you guys remember the Jags big comeback win in the playoffs this year? That was crazy
It's wild how mid the chargers have been with herbert. As a chiefs fan, I have never felt comfortable playing against herbert.
That really puts things into perspective
not bad
What a lame article.
He’s awful, we’ll take him!
Staley is the worst
Sell sell sell
I wish I could monetize Twitter by just tweeting easily searchable facts.
God I’d love him on the pats
You can see Ivey pretty much go to a diff place mentally when he’s competing. Good sign. Weird bench exchange there lol
Chargers gonna Charger. Remember 2010 when they had the #1 ranked offense and the #1 ranked defense and missed the playoffs?
They had a million injuries. Chill.
Who cares, they have their franchise QB. Something that many teams are still searching for.
Maybe time can the D3 coach, send him to back John Carroll.
I won’t consider the chargers a real team until they move back to San Diego.  Fun having a home game out west whenever the Steelers visit tho
I mean. He has plenty of offensive weapons, they made huge defensive splashes last year.  It feels like it's a coaching issue
it's simply illegal for the chargers to win anything important, even when they have great teams and coaches
wow, good thing they can just resign him and keep him for another 10+ years
Their coach is terrible and acts like a politician on the podium the way he delegates blame towards everybody but himself.
Team is super inconsistent form a coaching standpoint but I think we’re seeing Herbert is a bit overrated.
Good fuck Dean Spanos
It's the chargers they could have  Rodgers playing backup to mahomes Jamar Chase, Justin Jefferson, nick chubb, CMC, both kelces and every other elite player in the leauge and still managed to lose in the most unfortunate ways. It's not that they don't have the talent they are just cursed.
Derek Carr with the better arm
100% on the coach imo
Brandon Staley should have been laughed out of the league.
Chargers are the most overrated, over-hyped franchise. Every year they’re supposed to be this powerhouse and struggled to get 8 wins
Every time I see a tweet from him I think it’s Warren Sapp for a moment. Every single time.
Everyone knows all qbs have the most team success in their first 3 years in the league.
I still don’t get the Herbert hype. Yes he has a cannon but the decision making seems to be overlooked. Somehow always gets a pass for the turnovers and inconsistency. Worse QB’s have had greater success with far less talented rosters. Don’t dislike him but always hear his name in the elite convo and I don’t get it
I don't understand. . . the Chargers are supposed to be good this time.  It's like Mahomes 1a Herbert 1b.  Just ask any sports media or either Chargers fan.
What’s the worst that could happen? All you need to do is simply sign them to a new deal.
Imagine wasting a 4th rd rookie deal
Better than extending him twice and wasting 9 years, though.
From 2018-2021, there were four top QBs in the AFC on rookie deals.  Someone's had to be considered a waste.   I guess there are five if you count Herbert but he hasn't had those superstar moments of Mahomes, 2019 Lamar, 2020-2021 Allen, or 2021-2022 Burrow.  But, the Ravens were the only one of those four without even a AFCCG appearance
I think flacco did great his first 5 years. Wouldn’t you agree?
Lol imagine believing this nonsense about rookie deals. How many teams have won the Super Bowl recently with a qb on his rookie deal? 1?
Baltimore at least won a playoff game (and got a 1 seed which gets a bye so not exactly a win but move on to the next round) plus 2 more playoff trips. Chargers have 1 appearance and the most embarrassing loss
At least ours was injured, if Lamar is healthy the last two years we probably have a few more playoff wins
I mean look at Burrows playoff stats. They’re crap. So the Bengals are an epic defensive run away from the same fate. It’s all small sample size of luck and fate on a rookie deal.
Can't relate lol
Bears are wasting fields rookie deal , they didn’t even spend all their available space this off-season
Ravens had Lamar in position, he just blew the Titans game  Edit: Guys, Lamar put up 12 points and had 3 turnovers and a passer rating of 63.2
Lamar was given one of the 5-6 best rosters in the NFL around him.
Literally the ravens
I know, which teams would be stupid enough to do that?
At least you guys had a MVP season
Seriously, that would just be embarrassing
Tell me more,  lol...  it can always be worse, says some Cardinals or Browns fan.
Things rarely ever go as planned. The only QBs I can remember winning Super Bowls on their Rookie contract are Wilson and Mahomes.
:)
It Hurts, doesn’t it?
IMO Chargers franchise momentum was stalled by allowing Brees to leave as a FA just as he was peaking. He was basically pushed out by the $$$ arrival of Rivers. True that Drew reportedly had an injured shoulder, but obviously it wasn’t serious enough to keep him from a HOF career with the Saints from the get go. Miami was scared off by that injury as well - but what if : Brees vs Brady would have made the AFC East very interesting and perhaps changed Brady’s dominance arc in the AFC for all those years. It would have also positioned Sabin vs Belichick, Brees vs Brady as *the* popcorn show every season.
They wasted Rivers’ entire career so why are you surprised?
Lamar at least won an MVP to show for it. Chargers have nothing
Well it's the chargers.
Trying to imagine it, but just can't seem to do it.
...at least you had that one pretty good year... before the playoffs...
lol imagine wasting your QBs rookie deal and then also finding out he’s a rapist
As someone from Herbert's home town, it has been difficult to watch.
Buncha fools. You’re supposed to rest them for those formative years! #buffoons
See Packers.
At least you've experienced an MVP QB in your lifetime. And a Super Bowl win (two depending on your age)....  Meanwhile the Bears have been the epitome of mediocre.
Ya...
Chargers gonna charger
damn dude that’s vision right there
Then when that rookie deal is over, instead of paying him you just draft another rookie
Harvard wants to know your location.
Giga-brain strategy here
It’s a shame you never had drew Bree’s on a rookie contract to win 4-5 super bowls with him.
Exactly, and no matter how good he is, just let him walk and draft a new guy who’s just as good. A revolving door of rookie QB contracts is a foolproof plan
Now if only we can get a rookie QB...
I feel like I would fuck up and win a bunch of Super Bowls on my QB's second and third contracts.
Could Justin Herbert pull a Drew Bree’s. I like to think so
If you don't like your ~~job~~ QB, just find a new ~~job~~ QB on a rookie contact.
If I learned anything from Retro Bowl, you just always meet with your owner when you have the chance, until you get enough coach credits to raise the salary cap  It's not that hard
Why don’t teams simply do this? Are they stupid?
Why stop there?
Genius idea. How did NFL organizations not figure this out already?
Why not just draft the GOAT and win every year of the rookie deal? So easy
It's really a no-brainer
Worked for us that one year
Not sure why other teams don't try this.
Lombardi is a football terrorist, but our defense just can’t seem to keep teams from scoring 23+ points every game
The real tease was the second half of 2021 season actually looking like an ok offense. Only to crater back to awful. I wish he would have just been dog shit from the get go so they would have canned him earlier.
They are like the AFC Cowboys without the Super Bowl trophies to reminisce about
The raiders are the AFC cowboys.  Chargers are the AFC Vikings
Nuh uh, we won a playoff game on a QB rookie deal while still paying romo.
Except the Chargers have a good QB.
I was thinking the Mavericks of the NFL.
Bro they are the falcons of the AFC get it right
Just without all the rings
Iconic franchise with incredibly annoying national fanbase, sb championships you have to pull out the vhs tapes to reminisce on, constant debate over whether or not their mid-tier qb is elite. There's no question about it, if I look to the afc west for a cowboys analog I'm picking the Chargers
I like the Chargers
That'll be the Pats in a few years no doubt
Dude wtf man...the only thing keeping me going was thinking that we not dem boys.
yeah good thing we had that run in the early 90s that worked out so well for us  Dynasty!
The Cowboys actually had historical success. And nationwide fans. And a home stadium.  The Chargers have... one Super Bowl appearance, and half of that team dying early for some reason. And the best uniforms in the league. And the honor of being the 1 in 1-31.  As fun as it is to dunk on the Cowboys, a much more apt NFC comparison is the Panthers.
Just like the Vikings are the Bills of the NFC.
Still can’t believe the biggest and 5th biggest comeback ever happened in the same year  And both involved AFCS teams
I mean yea the game was like 2 months ago
Sweet flair. You a Jags fan from the Cheese League days? Seeing them train as a kid is what hooked me.
It’s not the only way to win, but you can’t deny what a massive advantage It is to have that available cap space to spend on other parts of your roster.
What was that statistic, something about no team until the 2022 Chiefs winning a Super Bowl with a QB making more than 13% of their teams cap space, it's not that irrelevant of a thing to bring up.
I think this narrative is more “every team with a QB on a rookie deal should win a super bowl or else the QB is a bust” which is equally ridiculous.
Yeah, Tom Brady's rookie deal allowed them to comeback from 28-3. Nothing else.
I can't think of the last team that won a Super Bowl with a QB on a rookie contract aside from Mahomes. Teams that get top level QBs almost always have terrible rosters for years, which is how they had an early pick to get the elite QB prospect.
Especially in the mahomes era.
Yeah, people act like a team is dead in the water when their QB gets paid and it’s silly. I mean, it does go that way sometimes, the Ravens with Flacco and the Seahawks with Wilson come to mind, but most Super Bowl winning teams these days were not won with rookie deal QBs. Only 2012 Flacco, 2013 Wilson and 2019 Mahomes come to mind.   It’s certainly an advantage to have a good but cheap QB so the cap can be spread to other players, but it’s also a disadvantage trying to win in the playoffs with an inexperienced QB. It does happen sometimes obviously,  but the results indicate your chances of winning a Super Bowl are better with a veteran.
Yes, having a QB on a rookie deal helps with cap space, but history shows it's honestly not very important.   These are the 6 teams since 2000 that have won a Superbowl with their QB on a rookie contract.  •Tom Brady with the Patriots in the 2001 season(it's Tom fucking Brady...)  •Ben Roethlisberger with the Steelers in 2005(went 15-1 with their Rookie QB the year before)  •Eli Manning for the Giants in 2007(good example)  •Flacco in 2012(maybe the best example)  •Wilson in 2013(good example)  •Wentz in 2017(was not the starter in the playoffs/SB)  •Mahomes in 2019(team went 12-4 the year before with Alex Smith, also signed a new contract months after the SB)
Teams that have made it to the Superbowl while having a quarterback on a cheap rookie deal since the wage scale came in in 2011:  49ers (Kaepernick)  Seahawks (Wilson) x2  Panthers (Newton)  Eagles (Wentz)  Rams (Goff)  Chiefs (Mahomes) x2  Bengals (Burrow)  Eagles (Hurts)  That's nine Superbowl participants from a possible twenty-four teams. Another SIX possible participants were teams quarterbacked by Tom Brady. Which means only nine teams made the Superbowl with a veteran quarterback not named Tom Brady since the rookie wage scale came in. They are:  Giants (Eli Manning)  Ravens (Joe Flacco)  Broncos (Peyton Manning) x2  Falcons (Matt Ryan)  49ers (Jimmy Garroppolo)  Rams (Matthew Stafford)  Chiefs (Patrick Mahomes)
I do love the Mara sisters.
Yeah like it was just a couple years ago the rams said fuck that.
Let's look at the previous dozen Super Bowl-winning QBs, shall we?   - Mahomes  - Stafford  - Brady  - **Mahomes**  - Brady  - Foles  - Brady  - P. Manning  - Brady  - Wilson  - Flacco  - E. Manning  A whole 1 for 12 on rookie deals winning it all. And I believe the last one prior to that was Big Ben another 6 seasons back. With another four before -you guessed it- Brady with his first in '02. Lots more rookie deal QBs have gone to the big show...and been beaten by teams with veteran rosters comprised of trades and FA signings. Funny that.
it makes perfect sense but there is basically no data to support it
Nobody has been winning Super Bowls with a quarterback making over 15% of the cap.   "At 12.61%, Tom Brady’s 2021 Super Bowl victory with the Buccaneers made him the highest cap-percentage quarterback to ever win the game, surpassing his 2018 victory with the Patriots, when he represented 12.42%."  Are y'all seriously forgetting the buzz when Brady took a massive pay cut to win?  A quarterback making 45 million a year eats 20%.  "The median cap percentage for a QB to win the Super Bowl is 10%. In the past 10 Super Bowls, 5 of the winning QBs represents less than 10% of the cap (with Nick Foles at 0.96% being the outlier), and 5 were above 10% (all named Brady or Manning)."  https://www.spotrac.com/spots/super-bowl-qb-cap-percentages-1397/#:~:text=The%20median%20cap%20percentage%20for%20a%20QB%20to%20win%20the,all%20named%20Brady%20or%20Manning).
Chiefs may never win again... Oh wait.
How do you figure?  Since this CBA settled in superb owls have pretty much exclusively been won by rookie deal QBs and top 10 all time HOFers.
It's overblown, but you should use the time to assembe a regular playoff team. By the time your qb hits their second contract, you should have 8-9 other players as your core and enough cap room to hold on to most of them for several years.
Win what though? The superbowl, how many teams have a realistic chance rookie or not. But maybe make a playoff spot and win a playoff game.
From a strategic standpoint, it makes sense. Just think back when rookie deals (namely for QBs) that were so high and absurd before they officially took a snap. Plus, teams were more patient back then and would sit their rookie QBs for a year or two before they actually got to play for real. These days, the QB prospects are smarter and more talented, so the goal of winning as quickly as possible makes more sense.
See: Patrick Mahomes
Only 2 out of 10 last SB winning QBs (Mahomes and Wilson) were on a rookie deal.
I can’t even think of one single team that has won a Super Bowl with a QB not on his rookie deal.
It's not the only way to win, but if you overspend on your QB, you are in trouble.  Problem is when people without rings want to reset the market.
The last time a quarterback that isn’t Patrick Mahomes won a Super Bowl on a rookie contract was Russell Wilson in 2014.
It's more about knowing what you got by the end of the contract and not having your hand forced in overpaying (see: possibly Daniel Jones)
Especially as we watch Mahomes dominate in his prime.
Great DC, not so much as HC
I remember at one point last year thinking ‘Staley might just be the 3rd worst coach in the league, but the 2nd best in the division.”
Still can't believe that moron wasn't fired on the spot 2 yrs ago when he called the timeout and sent the Raiders to the playoffs
Warren Sharp whose real name is [Tyler Brickner](https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_in/202112091547694) btw is a hack and this is selfpost material that mods would delete within 60 seconds.  He is high on my list of twitter users I'd like to ban on this subreddit.
They’ve also improved every year since drafting Herbert. It shouldn’t be considered the norm to go from 5-11 to 15-2 overnight.
Lol Lamar Jackson gets absolutely shat on on this sub, despite Greg Roman being a passing game terrorist.
Yes just draft a top 5 qb every time the deal expires. Easy peasy
it maybe gets exaggerated to “you can’t win without a QB on a cheap deal” which is incorrect, but it’s undeniably beneficial
But winning playoff games is less hard and they're not doing that either.
Almost as if 96% of teams don't win it every year. But if you don't win it for a few years you should blow your team up... weird league but at the same time I inject this shit into my veins
The Chargers have to be one of the worst teams at meeting expectations. It seems like there have been so many years where I liked their team, and they either play inconsistently or they play well all season, but fail in the playoffs. I'm not even a Chargers fan, and I feel let down by the organization.
any chargers fan that thinks staley isn't a problem is just deluded. I've been a fan forever, Staley is among the worst coaches I've ever seen in my life. dude is straight up fraudulent trash.
Tommy's needed to be on the hot seat for a while lmao. Last year, I'll give him a bit of a pass but if they can't get some decent results this year, I'd get him the fuck out.
shouldn't be the one drafting for us this year lmao
I mean how the chargers are fumbling the rookie deal shit. The chiefs won on Mahomes rookie deal. The patriots did for Brady. The bengals made a Super Bowl and 2 afc championships. The chargers haven’t had a lot of progress in the first 3 years of a good qb.
Warren Sharp really wants you to retweet his tweets
there isn’t one in a vacuum but it’s so close to what the talking point of the chargers team should be and that’s the Spanos family has kept Telesco around for 10 years with a losing record and the last 3 head coach hirings have all been terrible.
Clicks. It is always for the clicks, no matter how dumb a take like, "How the Chargers can get to the playoffs?" and the answer is win more games than the other teams in your division....
NFL Analysts have a hard on for Herbert (fairly warranted though) and want to point out how the Chargers have completely wasted his talent in the window created by the rookie deal.  Other teams like the Chiefs, Bengals, Eagles, and Bills have been able to capitalize on their premiere rookie QB deals.
Yea, dude is on OC #3 in 4 years. It’s wild how everyone things wins and losses are solely on the QB
On a lot of other teams he would be
I hope he demands a trade. His ceiling is very high and I don't want my donkies to have to deal with it
Over the cumulative 4 they are dead last in defensive scoring allowed IIRC
So just have a good team and then draft Patrick mahomes every 5 years.  What's the issue here, why are all 32 teams not doing this.
I think they fired some trainers and position coaches. Beyond Lombardi and Day
No, no... You guys earned that one last season.
Staley should have been fired once his defense proved to be the single worst thing you can put around your advantage at quarterback: a run funnel that let bad teams limit possessions.
If only y'all's head coach was a defensive mastermind
The defense kept the Jaguars scoreless for an entire half, Herbert has a lot of blame for that choked lead just as much as the defense
In 20 years, this sub will look at Herbert like David Carr: lots of potential wasted by a bad team.
I like Herbert a lot but using the defense as an excuse when they have JC Jackson, Derwin James, Khalil Mack and Joey Bosa seeks kind of weak.
A bit of Schadenfreude to start my lunch, how lovely!
Herbert is about to get a contract that will pay him 50M per year. When you're getting paid that much, you're expected to carry a poor defense. If he can't do it now, why do you expect him to do it in the future?
Your defense isn't even bad, you just have a mid team.
Yes, option 2 is ridiculous.   Having a franchise quarterback does not guarantee success, but not having a franchise quarterback guarantees failure.  Justin Herberts do not grow in trees. Is he a top 3 QB? No, but it’s highly unlikely that they would draft a QB as good as him, even if they had the #1 pick every single year for the next 5 years.  Resigning Herbert is not “committing to 5-6 more years of mediocrity”. It’s buying themselves a chance to rise above mediocrity, through smart personnel moves, good coaching, and of course good play on the field. Without Herbert that team is bad and likely would be bad for the next several years.
It’s worth pointing out that the Chargers didn’t do anything with Drew Brees or Phillip Rivers, either. They’ve had a string of QB’s almost every other franchise would kill for & have nada to show for it. Their issues are related to ownership not players.
He does not have the same resume as Mac Jones
Congrats on saying the dumbest thing I’ve read today
Kyler Murray*
Mac Jones also doesn't have Keenan Allen, Mike Williams, and Austin ekeler.  Not saying he'd be a superstar with that, but the pats offense as a whole has been deficient.
This is sound meandering nonsense. Most of their major players have been available. Keenan missed a like 11 of games since 2017. Mike Williams missed 13 since being drafted in 2017. They aren’t Ironmen but that isn’t “never available”. I’ll give you Bosa and James the last few years have been hit or miss. But both had healthy streaks before getting paid.   Also in a year where they were all hurt and missed time they still made the playoffs because of their depth.
He’s not leaving so we’ll just take McVay off your hands.
Didn’t Mahomes win on rookie contract in 2019 season?
we woulda still lost. our defense couldn't stop the run for shit. we let a 3rd and 20 through on a fucking draw play lol
are you talking about the cowboys or the chargers
It is hilarious.  Most AFC West fans probably enjoyed their epic collapse in the 2022 playoffs, but I personally enjoyed them losing to the Raiders in the 2021 week 18 win-and-in game a bit more.
Lamar is better than Flacco, but the overall Ravens team was much better when Flacco was playing.
Why didn’t the chargers just draft Burrow and go to the Super Bowl instead of Herbert.
Herbert has been getting shit on daily on this sub since January 14th. What are you on about?
There's a legit chance an average team can beat out the LA Herberts for a playoff spot. Not so much with the Chiefs.
Yeah, but you get an extra home game in Vegas and LA every year, so that's cool.
Who says that?
For two years Tua didn't have wrs and yet he still found a way to get wins.
Herbert to SF confirmed.
The exact quote was “If shitdick spent more time on the playbook and less time combing his hair, we’re playing next week” no reference to Ryan unless i missed something.
You’d take him
The notion that QBs can carry teams deep into the playoffs basically by their talent alone is silly. All great QBs need help to win and Herbert hasn’t gotten a lot of it from his coaching staff.
Do you feel the same way about Lamar?
Kind of sounds like Lamar tbh except he’s never available for the playoffs.
That’s an extremely bad take. Herbert has been limited by coaching and injuries. If you don’t think Herbert will ever be elite than you really don’t know football
All of Phillip Rivers kids must be down voting you.
You’d take him
Give Herbert jamar chase, tee Higgins, Tyler Boyd, and the defense you’ve had the last two years and the conversation would be very different.
Chiefs won SB LIV on Mahomes’ rookie deal.
Always nice to have them locked down for the next 4-5 years. Would be crazy if a team got them under contract for longer than that though.
Just call up his agent after year 3 and hammer out a deal.
It’s just getting them to sign a piece of paper how hard could that possibly be?
Just call up their agent and get it done.
If FDR can get Washington to sign a New Deal despite living in a wheelchair then I see no reason why Lamar can't compel Baltimore to do the same
Or grab a sunken qb from another team ;)
Dak woukd go first in a 2016 redraft. We got him in the fourth round and didn’t ever go “all in” until…this coming season
How about 12 years?
Cries in Falcons
Certainly underperformed on Lamar’s rookie deal. I’m not sure it matters, but I think it’s more due to injury and a stinker of a game in 2019 then any roster construction decisions.
2022 Allen was statistically better than 2021 Allen but it didn't feel like it.
Wilson 2013 and mahomes 2019 are the only ones I can think of recently
huh interesting thought. Looking back at say the last 3 or so SB winners:  * Patrick Lavon Mahomes II 2022-2023 - NOT on a rookie deal * *John* Matthew Stafford 2021-2022 - NOT on a rookie deal * Thomas *Edward Patrick* Brady *Jr.* 2020-2021 - NOT on a rookie deal  Great news for the Chargers, no sweat trying to win this year there's always Herbert's second contract!  Edit: Added some *more respect* to their names. I appreciate the help.
If that's the case, just draft a new QB every 4 years. That's worked for the Broncos and Browns right?
If you go back ten years, 3. Wilson 2013, Mahomes 2019 and arguably Wentz in 2017 even though he didn't finish it because of the injury.  If you expand that to how many teams have *made* the Super Bowl on a rookie deal in ten years, that becomes 8:  Kaepernick in 2012, Wilson in 2014, Goff in 2018, Burrow in 2021, Hurts in 2022.  So 40% of the time in the last ten years, a team with a QB on a rookie deal has made the Super Bowl. Doesn't really seem like nonsense, especially considering Tom Brady by himself took up 25% of the available QB slots. So having a QB on a rookie deal is 15% more likely to get your team to a Super Bowl than having Tom Brady. That's not really a bad deal.
Yeah, it's stupid. So many factors are at play when it comes to reaching and winning a Super Bowl. Some of those factors, such as injuries, are out of the team's control.
I mean you can also say the same about Top-5 money QBs. How many top-5 money QBs have won the SB in the last 20 years? It can't be many since Tom's won the lion's share. Mahommes this year is one?
ah yes, Lamar is the one who blew that game
Get this man in a front office STAT
The ravens have entered the chat
The old Reddit strategy. Pay nobody. Field all rookie contracts.
My location is where I am
The Chargers D was better down the stretch when they got some of their players back and they wound up finishing 16th in DVOA. That's obviously not very good, but with a QB as good as Herbert it's enough to theoretically contend for the Super Bowl, because, theoretically, you wouldn't have a football terrorist calling plays and a bunch of injuries
I could have fucking told you that.   But apparently to some Chargers fans last off season, I don’t know what the fuck I am talking about.
Exact opposite to our problem.
Bosa injured fucks your defense
chiefs put up 38 points against the eagles who were pretty dominant on defense. that's just the NFL in 2023.
So they’re really closer to let’s say…the Vikings
We’re more the afc falcons thank you very much.
And obnoxious fanbase
What’s the statute of limitations on reminiscing about a Super Bowl win? Asking for a friend.
Yeah, this. Thanks for Kellen Moore???
So the Bills?
LMAO no.  The Cowboys actually get to the playoffs.
The Cowboys are hardly ever terrible. They are usually a good regular-season team. The Raiders, are always terrible, so the comparison isn't great.
Dak owns the eagles lmao...
Which makes wasting his rookie deal all the worse tho
The Mavs won a championship in 2011.
At least y’all had your Chiefs comeback in 2013
And 3 of the 4 biggest comebacks in jaguars franchise history happened in a 90 day span
Bro, its the Chargers.
AFCS is here for chaos.
It's an advantage for sure, but the tweet making it seem like the Chargers can't compete as soon as they pay Herbert is asinine.    It's easier to find cheap position players than it is to find an elite QB on the cheap.
I read somewhere that only 3 teams have won a super bowl while their QB makes something like 13% of the salary cap  It was Tom Brady, Matt Stafford, and Patrick Mahomes.   I’m sensing a pattern
I can definitely deny it. Both the Rams and the Eagles did it *without* the actual QB. And Brady’s savings was like $10M, hardly a difference maker
It’s just far too rare of an occurrence for any team to count on it. Even the top rookie QBs need time under center to get better. Remember Peyton freaking Manning has the interception record and needed half a decade to break through.
Since 1994 there have only been 6 QBs who won on their rookie deal (actually 5 because the list counts Wentz).  It's more of an advantage on paper than it is in reality.
9/24 participants of the last 12 Super Bowls had a QB on a rookie deal (counting Wentz)    Three of those nine would end up winning the Super Bowl (counting Wentz again)
The Rams had 20%+ committed to Stafford and Jared Goff when they won
Yeah but that’s misleading because most teams just use their qb as a bank and borrow against the future.
Rams in 2021?
The real rookie deal was the James White one.
As with all things, Tom Brady is the exception
Are you kidding me?   Brady took a massive pay cut and gave the Pats and Bucs hometown deals. He saw the data. He knew he would win and be recognized as the GOAT in the salary cap era by stacking his team on a 50% pay cut versus pursuing a max deal.
2013 Seahawks  Also 2017 Eagles (they had Wentz and the backup Foles)
It's only been 2 QBs, Wilson and Mahomes, who have won a Superbowl on their rookie contract since the wage scale was implemented (Flacco was drafted prior to the rookie wage scale). The Eagles won the Superbowl with a QB on a rookie contract but we had a veteran for the big game.
Ravens and Joe Flacco in 2012?  They're the poster children for this. Won on the rookie deal, then got a huge contract and the team couldn't build around him as well with tighter cap space.
I kind of hate when Wilson is included in this rookie deal stat, the entire LOB was on their rookie deal. Who cares how much your QB makes when you have a top-3 all time historical defense all on rookie deals.
Jimmy G was also not getting PAID PAID for a QB when he made the SB right? The mahommes and manning years can kinda be seen as exceptions as pretty much no QB right now is as good as they are/were.
If you're throwing out Brady, then half of the Super Bowl participants have been veteran QBs, and half have been rookie deals.
Why are we not counting Brady? Mahomes is basically taking the Brady route contract wise so it feels weird to not include him.
Flacco was on his rookie deal when he won the SB.
Surely Mahomes is now the highest % after this past season, no?
Mahomes just won at 17%
The only one on a rookie deal was Mahomes. The rest were mostly Brady, who definitely was not on a rookie deal.
and then he got to live through that Jaguars abomination this year. Dude is such a fucking conman, so tired of seeing his dork ass sipping on his coffee after every shit loss repeating the same dogshit.
Ruined one of the best games of all time
Tyler has definitely sent angry dms to players and teams cause his parlay missed.
I’ve posted the Tyler Brickner thing a few times as well. Sharp is a hack that should be banned here.
I mean you’re not wrong at all, and maybe my bias is strong seeing both of my flairs, but Lombardi is literally just a football terrorist in general. Roman at least had a decent run game playbook where as Lombardi was miserable at all things football. Also Herbert being the kind of elite arm talent that he is and he was being used to throw the ball behind the line of scrimmage more often than in front of it helps. If Herbert comes out and has a stinker under Moore, then I think he gets shat on a bunch, but the way he was being used everyone can agree was a terrorist act.
Jokes aside, Eagles made 4 straight NFCCGs and a SB with McNabb on a rookie deal. Wentz on a rookie deal, won SB. Hurts on a rookie deal, made SB. It's not the only way to succeed but clearly the "QB Factory" thing has merit when done correctly.
And yet ironically the ~~vast vast~~ majority of Super Bowls are won by teams spending a huge chunk of change on their QB, not with QBs on a rookie deal. Unlike most positions in football, most good QBs continue to improve into their 30s. The real winning formula is seemingly to get a great QB in their prime and surround them with great players on rookie deals or quality FAs signed at a good rate.  Looking it up, QBs on rookie deals do win with some frequency, but it’s more common for a 5-10+ year veteran QB on a good team to win. But basically what I’m saying is a near perfect QB with a good, not great team > a less experienced QB with a great team, at least when it comes to winning SBs.
>The patriots did for Brady  Not really. They had Bledsoe at $100M on that team.  Brady signed a new deal right after the first Super Bowl
At the same time, their conference is absolutely loaded. Chiefs in their own division and then even if they beat the Chiefs they have to get through the Bengals and the Bills.  If Herbert was on an NFC team, I could see him having a pretty good shot at winning the Super Bowl in the next 5 years or so. But if he has to get through at least 2 of those teams, plus an ascending Jags team on top of beating the NFC champion, that's fucking rough.  It's almost exactly like what it was for Rivers his entire career, had to try to get through Brady, Peyton, Roethlisberger and of course the legendary elite dragon Joe Flacco.
Using maybe the two best QBs ever as examples for comparison seems silly.
Honestly Herbert isn't as good as any of those QBs you mentioned.
Some teams fumble their rookie qb deals. Some fumble years of a loaded roster. Chargers manage to do both. Sun is bright, water is wet etc etc.
2 HCs in 4 seasons and 3 OCs in 4 seasons. Not really the blueprint to success. People see mahomes strive under Reid and bienemy and think its just that easy. Also doesn’t help our defense has been miserable at best
Tua has also had 3 OCs. 23-13
This isn’t directed at you, but at the larger conversation…  When it’s Justin Herbert, the team is to blame for the .500 record and lack of playoff success.  When it’s Kirk Cousins, ***he*** is to blame for the .500 record and lack of playoff success.   It’s funny how opinions change when the subject has a name. 😂🙄🤣
I see a lot of stuff about how Burrow is heads and shoulders above Herbert now and no one can deny that Burrow has had amazing on field success (even me a Burrow hater) but I have no doubts Herbert could do the same things or greater on that team. Unfortunately this is the second time in recent memory that you experienced this. I can't bring myself to say Rivers is better than Ben was out of fan loyalty but if they magically switched rosters for their whole career I bet Rivers at least gets a ring or two
Lets ride
Don’t get me started on Staley lol. Shoulda been long gone after 27-0
Chargers defense seems worse under Staley then it was when Lynn was coaching.  Staley’s been a complete fraud so far, despite the roster upgrades our defense is still hot garbage
JC Jackson? Who blew his knee out week 7? And joey Bosa whose dick fell off week 3?
I mean the numbers don’t lie. They’ve been a bottom 3-5 defense regardless of talent every year Staley has been there
Go at look how many snaps those four guys played together last year
If you switched the Chargers and Bengals defense, Herbert would have something like an .750 winning percentage and Burrow would have an under .500 record based on average scoring lol  EDIT: And I'm not saying its a perfect comparison or a scientific point, I'm just trying to illustrate that Herbert has had the *worst* (by quite a bit) average scoring defense in his 3 years of any good QB and other top level QBs have a significantly easier time winning games with their defense.
JC was complete dog shit AND got injured for the season and Bosa missed like all of the season. Actually watch the games and not just the sexy names, our defense under Staley has been fucking pathetic. Guru my fucking ass.
Lmao carr lost his job with the nfls leading rusher and the best WR.  Enjoy that rebuild
Lamar has had a good defense every year howd that work out for y’all
I think you misunderstood what I meant if you think I’m implying Herbert is the problem
No man exact same. Remember when Herbert was benched for a fourth round rookie?
You’re right. Even though both 0-1 in the playoffs, at least Mac was just thoroughly outclassed by Allen and the Bills.   Herbert was held scoreless for 42 minutes by the Jacksonville Jaguars
Why not both?
The problem isn’t Herbert though it’s coaching weirdly enough I don’t think Zac Taylor is better than Staley however zac Taylor record speaks for itself, while Staley is on the hot seat.
It really is that simple. I honestly don’t know why the rest of the league didn’t do it.
Exactly. It’s laughable to compare the two as equals.
Fucking sucks to be a home away from home doesn’t it?
Tons of people.   In almost ever discussion about the AFC west it’s Mahomes and Herbert getting lumped together as if they’re equals.
People were calling Tua a bust before a had a good 2022 year with Hill and Waddle.
I’m taking this as the absolute truth
Lombardi was more of a play scrap of paper kinda guy. Not much to memorize.
Absolutely not. We already have an overrated QB
Funny you ask that because my comment was making fun of the criticism people make of Lamar. We can't say the same about golden boy Herbert though without ya'll acting up.
I'm just roasting Herbert with the same criticism people make of Lamar but ya'll still go and make it about Lamad anyway lol. Rent free
He’s at least won a playoff game
Hahahaha, worth it
Yes Brady, Big Ben, Russell Wilson, Mahomes, Eli Manning and Wentz (if that counts). I just looked it up.
Wait you're supposed to draft good quarterbacks? Why didn't we know about this strategy?
What kind of an insane team would hand a young QB a 5+ year extension ASAP after year 3?  Aren’t you supposed to drag it out, franchise them, and make a whole big drama thing about it before ultimately signing them for even more money?
Hold up, do you guys not just find pro bowl QBs off the trash heap?
It would almost be like cheat mode. Especially if it was a team friendly one
"Ken Francis? Yes thanks I'd like to talk about getting Lamar extende- The Whole Gym training equipment on a 5% discount today only you say? Let's table the Lamar talk until 2024 or once I get shredded. Whichever comes last."
“I mean it’s one contract, Lamar, what could it cost, 1 billion dollars?”
He might have been a 1st in 2016 if he didn't get a DUI a month before the draft
It's funny because while Dak was undeniably the best pick in that draft, if anything he cost the Cowboys a superbowl run because it led to them going 13-3 and losing immediately with their best QB on the bench.   Just some food for thought from a championship ball club...
Were the Cowboys not all in his rookie season? Except Romo was supposed to be at the helm.
Jerry is out every year talking "all in" SuperbowlrightnowgoCowboys. What in the Arlington tax victory would you believe this is an all in year? Cowboys are drama and I love the show. One of my favorite threads on reddit was about Zak's rookie year. Cowboys had just lost the playoff game. Philly fans kept commenting "Romo would have blocked the kick."
12? Try 16!
Matt Ryan eventually became really, really good towards the end of his career. Shame, really.
Wasn't the only stinker  Ba-dum
Yeah, of those we probably had the best regular season. That team was flawed but we were also just killing everyone over that stretch. Shame it didn’t work out in the playoffs, between our failures and a very well-executed game from the Titans
2020 was the year that should’ve been big for the Ravens. I absolutely think the ceiling was low due to roster construction. Front office doubled down on a poor offensive structure that got hot due to Lamar’s ability and continued adding to an already good defense. Adding an established pass catcher after the 2019 season could’ve dramatically changed the trajectory of the team during Lamar’s rookie deal
Technically 2017 wentz
Exactly. 2 in 10 years.  Sick of hearing about rookie contracts nonsense.
I like how you use their full names. It implies you know them on a somewhat personal level.
I think the last one was Mahomes’s title. Then. I don’t recall prior to that.
I don't know enough about math to claim this with certainty, but since Brady can't be on both sides of the bracket the same year, wouldn't he be 5 out of 10 possible appearance is not 5 out of 20?
He wasnt solely responsible but hes been really awful in the playoffs. Not even mediocre. Im talking multiple turnover games and having more turnovers than scores.
WiNs ArE a QuArTeRbAcK sTaT
We were traumatized after things fell apart with Flacco. Although it’s worth noting we had a better shot in 2014 than people realize/remember

Where are you?
The missile knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where it isn't, by subtracting where it is, from where it isn't, or where it isn't, from where it is, whichever is greater, it obtains a difference, or deviation. The guidance sub-system uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is, to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position where it wasn't, it now is. Consequently, the position where it is, is now the position that it wasn't, and it follows that the position where it was, is now the position that it isn't. In the event of the position that it is in is not the position that it wasn't, the system has required a variation. The variation being the difference between where the missile is, and where it wasn't. If variation is considered to be a significant factor, it too, may be corrected by the GEA. However, the missile must also know where it was. The missile guidance computance scenario works as follows: Because a variation has modified some of the information the missile has obtained, it is not sure just where it is, however it is sure where it isn't, within reason, and it knows where it was. It now subracts where it should be, from where it wasn't, or vice versa. By differentiating this from the algebraic sum og where it shouldn't be, and where it was. It is able to obtain a deviation, and a variation, which is called "air"
The defence looked good down the stretch because they played absolutely pathetic teams. The only defensive performance I was genuinely a little impressed by was the Dolphins game. The rest were totally whatever.
In that time frame though we also played 5 bottom 10 teams and suddenly our defense looked lights out until we played an even passable offense again. I’m not hopeful for our defense getting out of the bottom barrel for next year since Staley is still our coach.
That sounds about right. Usually mediocre, rarely truly terrible, and occasionally really good regular seasons. But all we’re left with are heartbreaking playoff losses
If anyone's the AFC Vikings, it's us.
I think they are similar to the Cowboys in the sense that they always have lots of hype going into the season, that's not really the case with the Vikings
Falcons have at least come close to winning a Super Bowl the last 2 decades.   Half the players in the league weren’t alive the last time the chargers were in the Super Bowl, and it’s not like that game was competitive either
Pot calling the kettle black
You have to have been alive for it lol
I was more so talking about how both the cowboys and raiders need vhs tapes to see their last Superbowl wins.
as much as it pains me to say it, but the raiders were in the playoffs like a year ago
Like 145 points  in last 3 games. Its actually been crazy.
Chargers could have had one if Brady didn’t exist. Still, going from Rivers immediately to Herbert and making splash moves that have failed to support him so far reminds me a lot of Dirk to Luka and trading for KP and Kyrie.
A decade ago, that's crazy. Time really is a motherfucker
And what division do the Jags play in?
Also three years  The first of which was a surprise since Herbert wasn’t the initial starter and they were still in the rebuild phase  Year 2 improved notably but still stumbled and missed the playoffs  Year three made the playoffs and lost in a first round choke job for the ages  It’s not like they’re getting worse it’s not massive leaps but they clearly trended forward. I think people have gotten blinded by the likes of Mahomes and just think you should be making giant leaps each year with a rookie deal  Aside from KC who actually has one recently with a QB on the rookie deal? Bucs had Brady, Rams had Stafford, Mahomes is no longer on his rookie deal and he just won. Burrow was but he didn’t win, Allen hasn’t made one  IDK where this “you need a rookie QB deal” came from since teams winning super bowls don’t have that
I get what you are saying in theory, but if they weren't able to give him a competitive roster with the extra cap space from his rookie deal, what are they going to be able to do when he makes 50m?
I think it’s more saying they can’t compete even before they’ve paid him
Having an elite quarterback making 15% of the cap is barely getting teams to the Super Bowls and they aren't winning.   That's a healthy sounding logical argument and all but the proof is in the pudding.   Brady, at 12.6%, is the quarterback who received the biggest chunk of his teams cap and won the Super Bowl in recent years.
Other than Matt Stafford they have ruined my life  Is that the pattern?
As far as I know, only Russ and Mahomes have won on their rookie contract since it was added.
I think teams go on a run of good draft picks and then falter. Like the Eagles from 2012-13, the Giants from 2007-10, and the Seahawks from 2012-14.
The biggest cap hit by a qb on a sb winning team was Jared goffs dead cap hit on the rams last year (until pat broke that record tge next year, iirc)
I think the biggest statistic people seem to be missing is **QBs on rookie contracts winning percentage in the Superbowl**. It's easier to build a stacked roster when your QB is being paid cheaply but once you get to the Superbowl you have an advantage with the more experienced QB.  If you excluded Wentz (since Foles was a veteran at that point who already completed his rookie contract) it's basically been 2 Superbowl wins by a QB on their rookie contract since the new rookie wage scale was implemented.
Having a good QB on their rookie contract is definitely a good thing, but its importance has gotten way overblown recently.  **Only 4 times in the last 20 years has the Super Bowl been won by a QB on their rookie contract** - [Mahomes, Russ, Flacco, and Big Ben (his first SB)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Super_Bowl_starting_quarterbacks).   Edit: missed one
Nothing about the pay cut was massive. It was probably enough for 1 decent role player extra
Yeah, but Flacco was drafted #18, so it's comparable. He wasn't on big money like a Stafford or Bradford. He was like 5yrs/$30m.
yea, your 3 options for a super bowl are be Tom Brady, QB on a cheap deal (rookie or backloaded vet), or one of the best defenses of the decade/all time (seahawks/broncos)  There are very few exceptions the last 5-10 years.  Even if you look at the 4 teams who make the conference championships they most all fall into one of those.
That entire defensive line was also paid peanuts, too. Avril and Bennet were picked up super cheap and were performing like pro bowlers, allowing the Hawks to jus rush 4 most games, which made our secondary even better. The corners were also huge and could take on running backs, which is an underrated skill, which let the linebackers occupy the area behind the line and be aggressive. Really that defense was a unicorn and came together by a lot of miracles.   So where was the money? It was all tied up in an offensive line that was just mediocre. I think we had the highest or second highest paid O-line in the league, although they didn't really play like it. I think we won despite over paying an under-peforming position.  To create that defense they had to win big not just on rookies, but also free agent signings.
Garroppolo did get a significant contract from the 49ers after his first nine starts for them, so I consider him an expensive veteran. I believe it was the most expensive QB contract in terms of guarantees when it was signed
Because only two teams can/have successfully executed the "have Tom Brady at quarterback" strategy and nobody else can moving forward. He is the outlier
His rookie deal predated the introduction of the rookie wage scale and therefore was not cost-controlled
Feels like I remember reading he was at 19% this year, but I could be getting that number from nowhere.
I just wrote that elsewhere in the thread. 😬😂  If Mahomes won while making 35 million, how is anyone supposed to beat him if they're making more than that?
?  2022- Mahomes vs Hurts (RD)  2021- Stafford vs Burrow (RD)  2020- Brady vs Mahomes (RD)  2019- Mahomes (RD) vs Garrapollo  2018-  Brady vs Goff (RD)  2017- Wentz (RD) vs Brady  2016- Brady vs Ryan  2015- Manning vs Newton (RD)  2014- Brady vs Wilson (RD)  2013- Wilson (RD) vs Manning  2012- Flacco (RD) vs Kaepernick (RD)  Thats 4 winners and 11 participants. There has only been 1 single SB that didn't feature atleast one rookie deal QB team.
Chiefs were also the only team in the final 4 that paid a QB.
>Chiefs in their own division  They should probably worry about trying to establish a winning record vs either the Broncos or Raiders first  > even if they beat the Chiefs they have to get through the Bengals and the Bills.  Again, they lost to the Jags in the WC last round.   Right now they aren't being capped because of the elite competition, they're limited because they can't consistently put themselves above other teams fighting for playoff spots.
No shit
True but not yet I think Herbert has time to grow. Brady won his first mvp in 2007. Gannon in 2002 and he was drafted in like 89 I think.
I think players just have a stigma and Herbert is going to pick up that same stigma if the chargers don’t get far in the playoffs this year.   I have always believed its not JUST about QBs
I don’t follow the Chargers at all but that sucks they can’t stay healthy.
I’d take Lamar over Herbert. Just my opinion.
46-15 with less talent around him on offense than Herbert and the Ravens being at the bottom of the league in offensive spending outside the QB position. 2nd highest in ppg behind only the chiefs since 2018.
Not even a good troll. Before you start replying with nonsense, 32/32 teams (including the one in Boston) would pick Justin over Mac.   Your position is such nonsense that it doesn't even deserve a debate
So outclassed that the next game against them, Belichek didn’t let Mac throw more than 3 passes.
You say that like the Jags are bad. They and the Lions are on the rise big time and both have such shitty divisions that they are going to make the playoffs nearly by default this year
I think Moore was hired knowing if Staley is ass but the offense is good he will be heir apparent. You don’t hire an OC on the upswing who may be gone after year one.
I doubt Staley is much worse than ZT. ZT is an elite person and great leader but his scheme and in game management still need to improve. That said, glad ZT is getting our culture right
Idk it just seems like the Chargers could've just gone with Burrow and gone to the Superbowl? It really is that simple
League fucked up once by not getting Mahomes, twice by passing on Josh Rosen, and thrice by letting Burrow just fall to the bengals. It’s insane.
Never heard anybody say that. I've seen Mahomes get compared to Allen and Burrow and that's about it
People also said tua couldn't throw the bad deep.  They we proven wrong.    Tua's "bust" years were still resulting in a better record then Herberts "MVP" seasons
Herbert has an idiot for a coach. He’s cost them plenty of times. Herbert is a good ass qb. I’d take him any day and you should too.
They’re clearly just fucking with us, don’t sweat it
We’ve outsourced that to the 3rd world, Indiana
Nah, that's just crazy talk.  Paxton Lynch was the right move.
You can draft good QBs? I thought that was a myth
But Paxton Lynch!
We get our greats from the Colts it's just Luck retired to early.....
No you are supposed to sign qbs who are already developed and quickly approaching retirement.
I've heard John Elway is available, maybe you can land him.
Glad you guys are just now figuring that out
Why draft a good QB when you can just trade for one? Easy peasy.
Why draft your own QBs when the Colts can do it for you ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
WDYM? Elway drafted numerous tall white QBs. Surely one was the next Elway.
Naw over paying for washed QB's is the way to go.
With only 1 year of really good play too! What kind of crazy fuckin team would do that!
“Why make billions when we could make…. Millions?” - Lamar
One Barbillion dollars.
The Broncos probably would've drafted him in the 2nd if he didn't miss his flight to Denver for a pre draft visit.
I’m not sure we beat the patriots that year, or maybe even the falcons, but I agree that the better qb sat on the bench that game
That’s probably a fair observation actually, yeah
The Cowboys are in the awkward part of the Matt Ryan arc with Dak. Ryan had a great start to his career and went 14-2 early on, but then the franchise went to shit and wasted the next ~8 seasons.
Interesting that you take everything jerry says as gospel. He isn’t going to say “things look to be lining up better for us in 2023 so we are going to make some hard cuts this year” on his little radio show lol. Doesn’t take genius level intellect to look at their approach this off-season vs how they treated the last few (especially last year).
Sixteen factorial is a lot of years
Because he popped his pants one game
It seemed like they just figured Lamar would carry the entire offense himself. He's super talented, but that's just an unreasonable ask of anyone. The FO definetly failed Lamar.
Sure but BDN rolled it out to seal the deal
I think a better metric would be playoff appearances or playoff wins. Only one team gets the trophy, that doesn't mean rookie deal hasn't helped a team be in the hunt.
The real best strategy is to have the GOAT qb on a below market deal because his wife is a supermodel who makes way more anyway
Eagles in 2018 won because of Wentz’s rookie deal. He may have not played in the playoffs but he got them there with his play and lack of cap cost
Eagles just made the Super Bowl with hurts on a rookie deal and the year before burrow was in the Super Bowl on a rookie deal.
Except he didn't get it right because it's John Matthew Stafford, not Matthew Stafford.
Just wanted to put some respect on their names
Yeah turnovers in that game were what killed the Ravens.  With that said, Lamar had 500 yards of offense. He made a lot of mistakes that game, but that doesn't mean he was ineffective or couldn't move the ball against playoff teams.
that lateral pass TD killed the momentum.
At my location.
I see how you got your username.
The biggest issue is that we still allow runs up the middle too easily. With no pressure up the middle, teams run it up the gut and qbs just step up into the pocket when the pressure comes from the outside.   Need to improve our ilb core and NT so we don't have to rely on bringing Derwin James into the box anytime we're trying to stop the run. It makes it so damn predictable for offenses to audible out of that.   I really think Staley seems lost on defense now because his schemes rely on dominating the inside, which he was obviously able to do with Donald. Without that interior pressure, things fall apart.   If we had a Jamal Williams type of nt right now, our defense would go from mid to top 6 or 7 in the league. It might be easier to build with ilbs though and it's been a position I feel that has been an upgrade for 5+ years now. Always seems like an after thought for us.
That sounds like a better match  I'd say a better comparison for the AFC cOwboys would be the Raiders: Legacy built with an eccentric owner, a few SB wins, long time since being at the top, and merch that sells really well outside the local market.
Hey it’s me. You.
We are the undefeated off season champions
That’s a good point.
Maybe I’m blind but I never see Cowboys fans being obnoxious in here, or at least not any more obnoxious than any other team can be. And being in Dallas, I’d hardly call that an oddity, just regular football fans? I feel like I’m missing something with the  constant obnoxious fan base comments, because I never really see it.
You'll always be worse, get over it
Damnit. Now the real question is “Will I be alive for the next championship?”  My dad was 11 when they won it all in ‘57. He got to see one more playoff win over his last 62 years.
I’ve got the projector set up, kids! Let me load the reel and we can bask in pure Lions glory.
at least we can watch our super bowl wins!  &nbsp;  *cries*
And little to no regard about character issues of players
It was crazy to watch the Jags go from squeaking by the Titans to coming back down 27-0 lol
I think something that’s gotten lost in the whole “win with your QB on a rookie deal” conversation is that it’s kind of unfair to expect your young QB to be able to play at a Super Bowl winning level within just the first couple years of their career.   IMO a QB’s “prime” begins somewhere around age 27 and they’re off their rookie deal by that point.
There's been a lot of teams making it to conference championships with rookie deal QBs though.   Last year Eagles, 49ers, and Bengals all had rookie deals QBs.   I'd say that having an elite veteran QB is still the most reliable way to do it but there is definitely a trend of deep playoff runs by teams with cheap rookie QBs.
Hire competent coaches for starters.
Draft other rookies and have them on rookie deals
That’s a problem with the Chargers FO rather than Herbert’s contract though. The Chiefs have no problem putting together a competitive roster with Mahomes making 50m a year, if the Chargers can’t it means they need to find a new GM, not that they need to find a new QB.
> Brady, at 12.6%, is the quarterback who received the biggest chunk of his teams cap and won the Super Bowl in recent years.  Mahomes just won with 17% of the cap.
And 3/24 previous Super Bowl participants have won with a rookie QB (counting Wentz)    After a QB signs his big deal, his cap hit usually gets to be less and less as the years go on since the cap almost always rises.
Don't let your guard down.
And one of those was Mahomes, which, even if you draft a good rookie QB, you're probably not drafting Mahomes
There have been like ~15 superbowls with the new rookie wage scale, that's not a big enough sample size to do any kind of meaningful analysis in either direction
49ers too, they're top tier defense as well
Ah ok yea that's fair then. I thought they only gave him like 20/y or smth
Ah yes I remember when Wentz won the Super Bowl and Flaco beat himself
You're exactly right, and I did bring up the Jags later in my rant.   But yes, if they can't get through those initial steps, how are they going to really compete with those juggernauts in the AFC.
So then why even write comments like the one you did lol. Reddit in a nutshell.
It’s not trolling.   >	32/32 teams (including the one in Boston) would pick Justin over Mac.  Agreed. That doesn’t change he and the Chargers are overhyped beyond compare for relatively little production.
That game happened before, but I wouldn’t expect you to know much
I say that like the Jaguars weren’t a Super Bowl caliber team last year the way the 2021 Bills were.   You can see how defensive the sub gets. All I said was the Chargers and Herbert are treated as much  more dangerous than they are.
I wish I knew what to tell you. That’s the narrative I’m seeing.
Yeah he’ll be a great backup to Mahomes
Yes definitely, I'm pretty sure you want chain smoking vets and nothing else.
The real plan is to trade your all pro qb for one that gets thrown away by their current team.
As a Hoosier; can confirm. We've got a lot of issues in Indiana, but the worst is the whale oil shortage for our lanterns...
Red rover red rover, send Matt Ryan on over!
Trade you Sam for a first round pick.
Unfortunately I have some inside info that Indiana is no longer capable of providing any future QBs for Colorado. I would imagine Colorado is gonna have to look in a different direction in the future.
What did you send us you jerks?!?   I’m hopeful Russ can do better with a real coach. If not, you guys fleeced us epically 😭😂
The same Broncos who drafted Paxton Lynch in the 1st?
It felt like the coach didn't have the balls to do what Denver had done when benching Brock for Peyton. The thing is Dak was playing good ball for a rookie, but it was very conservative and Romo was still at a higher level of play at the point. You can't rely on game managing in the playoffs the way you can in the regular seasons because that's where you run into teams with elite QBs behind their offenses who can stack up points.
I feel like the 49ers would ruin any analysis of such metrics. 2 rookie qbs: one that is suffocating them and one that is giving their entire franchise CPR. What a wild situation that’s going to unfold in the Bay under center.
Sure 3 - 4 teams draft a QB they want to be their starter every year. In those first 3 years, that is 9 - 12 teams that has a QB starter on a rookie deal. If this was actually the best way to win a SB, then the stats would say it. And rookie QBs should have won at least 5 SBs not 2.
Yea but at end of the day only thing that really matters is winning it all. Playoff success is great and all but 20 years from now people will remember the Super Bowl winners not the teams that made playoffs and went far
I’d say Conference Championships made is the best. Deep playoff runs seem to be the expectation with a great QB on a rookie deal.
Not to go all InfoWars here, but given the franchise's general disdain for the rules I have to imagine Brady was getting paid under the table. Source: my ass
would having the next GOAT on a below market deal because he signed for a decade and everyone else surpassed him in that time count?
Or Brady's full name for that matter
gosh dang it. I didn't do my research
That was his best game in the playoffs arguably. He's actually averaged 300 yards passing in the playoffs which is more than his regular season avg. 55% though and plenty of turnovers that hurt.
One score (12 points as an offense) and three turnovers is what matters. They were moving the ball frequently but were 0-4 on 4th down.   Passing yards or total yards, nice things, however none of that mattered if the points don't go on the board.
A lot of that came after they were down tbf  12 points is also pretty ineffective
Bro, you know who else had 500 yards of offense in a game they lost? Big Ben vs the Browns. He sucked, and his 4 turnovers were a large part of us losing. That total yardage is more an indication of playing catchup and the other team enjoying a lead rather than offensive acumen.
What is your location?
I love you
I feel he's too sold on his philosophy too. I understand the logic of 6 plays for 40 yards>1 play for 40 yards because that's more opportunity for the defense to get a turnover. But, when offenses are running down your throat I feel you have to adapt at that point but he really loves the bend but don't break.
Yep oddly similar
First of all...
Wow that’s such a good comparison. At least the cowboys have won a playoff game in the last 20 years tho
i was thinking the browns, but raiders fit better because of superbowls instead of NFL championships
Plus both fan bases hate the Cowboys. Eerily similar for sure.
Anecdotal, but my only real negative experience has been with Cowboys fans OUTSIDE of Dallas. Same with Philly fans (wore a Rams hat all week while visiting PHI).   In my experience, it’s been a general trend when traveling—local fans seem to be way less awful than those out of market. I wonder if it has to do with a deeper connection since it’s often their favorite NFL team *and* home region? Idk. Packers fans in Wisconsin? Love ‘em. Packers fans in LA (with no connection to Wisconsin)? Would rather pull off my fingernails than talk football with them.   I’m sure I’ll get downvoted for it, but that’s been my experience as a Lakers fan, too. The majority of my family and friends in the area grew up rooting for them and are generally good basketball fans—any time I interact with, say, a Lakers fan from Wisconsin, I find myself secondhand embarrassed by their takes/behavior.
Microfiche at the public library
I've watched enough chargers football to not really be surprised they came back.  especially when their last 3 drives of the first half netted them about 5 yards, and only a field goal after starting one drive 5 yards from the end zone.  They are allergic to success
Damn, Mahomes about to enter god mode x2?!
You're right that it's a little unfair. The rookie deal QBs who have made it to a Championship game or Super Bowl, there are only 4 by my count: Mahomes, Burrow, Hurts and Allen. The other appearances have been led by veterans mostly from the NFC: Stafford, Rodgers, Brady, Garoppolo, Tannehill, Brees, etc.
The idea isn’t to expect guys to be at their prime in the first few years of their career. Although as an aside you should definitely know if they’re the guy by then.  The idea is you need a good roster to build a super bowl. And its tough to do that in the current NFL if you have one guy taking a stupid amount of the cap.   So of course, the generally most important and expensive position in the NFL making relatively dirt cheap salaries is gonna be a competitive advantage.
The Chargers problem is injury luck and competent coaching.    They don't lack talent.
Just wrote that in the thread twice. The article I referenced didn't have this years data.
>And one of those was Mahomes, which, ~~even if you draft a good rookie QB,~~ *unless you're drafting Mahomes,* you're probably not drafting Mahomes  FTFY
When that’s over a quarter of the max possible sample size, then it’s a good enough sample size.
it worked out to like 27m a year which at the time we gave it to him (2017) was the biggest AAV for a QB ever. but then right after that the QB market exploded and now only 5 years later you have guys like daniel jones and geno smith getting $35-40m a year
They did in 2019 he made 20mil which was 8% of their cap.  If your name isn't Brady then your best bet at making a SB is a rookie contract, or cheap contract for a veteran.
The eagles could only afford a backup like Foles because their starter was on a rookie deal.  This is one of the biggest advantages of having a rookie deal QB. Quality backups all over which makes these teams much more resistant to injury killing their season.
What do you mean. Winning rings while playing on the road as a wildcard team Vs stacked teams is piss easy. Look at Eli, he managed to do it while looking about as observant as Mr Bean though half of it with a tomato as his head coach for one of the NFCCGs
They could but it would be one of those "stars align perfectly" situations. Chiefs have an off year, the Chargers manage to take full advantage of it and they sneak up on the other AFC teams in the playoffs or get all the right breaks.  Otherwise, it seems impossible.  On the plus side, it's not like there's a high bar for postseason success in Chargers history... at least during the Super Bowl era.
Because those are very good players and should make the Chargers defense fantastic. I see a ton of excuses for Herbert thrown around but with guys like that defense should not be one of them. If that can’t stay healthy then that’s a different story but outside of Herbert nothing about the Chargers interest me so I don’t follow them at all.
14 TD’s to 11 INT’s  But, but… hE hAs ThE sAmE pLaYoFf ReCoRd!!
That narrative was a flickering flame at the start of the season and was snuffed out in February. Even as a chargers fan I can admit that. You kinda just sound like a salty divisional rival.
I hate Brees retiring so much, I can't even gas light other teams for having bad qbs now
Hey, that worked for the Fins for 6 games in 2017!
You could be like the hawks and just grab one out of the bargain bin?
It's a long hike from Gary before you can even begin whaling.
Lmaoooo
Come on, now. They were drunk.
Completely agreed. I think it’s wild that Garrett wouldn’t even let Romo compete for the job.
> And rookie QBs should have won at least 5 SBs not 2.  I mean, if you want to use projected Super Bowl wins versus actual Super Bowl wins to determine the best QB strategy, the answer is just "have Tom Brady" which, OK, not very helpful.
Its skewed because Tom brady won it the majority of the time. Also there's so much luck getting into the SB and winning that again, it skews the results. Getting to the Championship of each division is probably a better metric.
Sure, but if you're trying to build a team to win, you want to look at teams with playoff success. Ignoring the Bills just because of the 13 seconds game or the Bengals and Eagles for coming up just short is downright silly.
I am sorry I slightly disagree. I don't think winning it all is all that matters. Building a quality organization that is competitive and the fans can enjoy might matter more. This is just personal, but I enjoy watching the 49ers when I think they can win. But I don't expect them to win.   I grew up in an NHL city that won five stanley cups in seven years. I could get tickets to any game on game day(from the gate) and I know the arena wasn't packed either. People are way more excited now when they win a game and tickets sky rocket thousands and they don't win.
Bro you’re going to be miserable most sports seasons if you only are happy with a championship. Championships are obviously the ultimate goal, but you can’t tell me missing the playoffs is the same amount of fun you have as a fan as going to the AFC Championship and losing
I cant prove it but I agree with your ass
Krafts kids are gonna be shocked when robert dies and they find out he left the patriots to tom
I thought it was general knowledge that the team was buying his health supplements.    https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/report-patriots-pay-a-brady-owned-company-run-by-suspect-partner/
Who’s the next GOAT? There’s only one by definition
This is why I didn’t want the chiefs to win. Now this baby GOAT bullshit is going to keep going on and on
John Elway is a junior. Most people forget that.
Well you got some help
Where I am.
Right here!
I'm sorry. I only see you as a friend
You said a jackdaw is a crow…
How dare you….
Yea, as unfortunate as it is, credit where it's due Dallas has been a competitive football team for the bulk of this time. Just not at the level for which they are talked about
The Browns? That's the Commanders of the AFC.
Cuneiform tablets at the history museum
When they ran a jet sweep on a third and one that led to a fumble and punt which gave the jags the chance to cut it to 27-7 my heart started racing because I knew what might come. Never thought it would have actually happened.
Can't remember who said it but it was both peak Jags football and peak Chargers football.  High turnover rate by the Jaguars and an epic choke by the Chargers.
Just because you're right doesn't mean you had to say it :(
Truth hurts, man.
I mean you could say this year was his first year entering it.   His cap hit went up significantly, and he's had some injuries, but his knowledge of the game and command of his franchise have only grown, and it led to an all-time season for a QB.   Over the next 5 years he may lose some of that scrambling ability, and may not be able to always make those clean passes while falling, but I could see him mastering the pocket as well as Brady and still having massive success in his later, less athletic years
This gets repeated often and it's flat out wrong. We absolutely have a good amount of top end talent, but the players we have behind/around them is consistently lackluster.   If you look at the top 15ish players on our roster, we're near the top of the league in talent. If you look at the other 38, we're bottom of the barrel. Other teams have injuries and see the backups step up. Most of our backups tend to be either on practice squads or out of the league after a few years with us. Because they're not good.
Ya if their receivers could stay healthy that offense is fun to watch
teams r tripping over themselves to draft jackson mahomes after reading this
I’ll never get used to this
That's not how sample sizes work
Lmfao ok man
Not sure what you think you’re accomplishing lol.  The worse you make Mac Jones look, the worse same playoff record looks.   You’re acting like I said Mac is good. Quite the opposite
I’m not salty at all. In fact I’d take Herbert over Wilson in a heartbeat.   I’m just saying people like to say it’s a Herbert/Mahomes division and that’s just lunacy.
Yeah now you're team has the bad QB. How quick the turn tables
This is why I hate the Packers as much as I do. You can’t just string two HoF careers together at the QB position. It should be illegal and result in a 10 year playoff ban
Then what the hell have we been gathering out of Lake Michigan to make all of this oil?
I fuckin love Tony Romo. He's my quarterback. He put the franchise on his back and carried it for as long as his body would allow.   His body was done. His ability and determination was there, but his back and collarbones were targets and he would have been hurt again.
This is why it's dumb to argue that having a QB on their rookie deal isn't a huge benefit. Like anything else, take the anomaly of Tom Brady out, and see where the success lies. You either have to have a legit top 5 guy (Brees, Rodgers), or a guy on their rookie deal. The only outliers I can think of recently are the 2021 Rams, and the 2017 Eagles. The Rams had to sell their future for that ring, and the Eagles caught lightning in a bottle.
that is not possible, but everyone can get a QB on a rookie contract.
If you’re trying to build a team to win you look at the team that won it all first but sure playoff successful teams are 2nd
Yes winning and going to playoffs is great and all, that is what I said. But ultimately winning the championship is what people remember 20+ years later. I stand by that, idk why people think that is wrong.
That is not what I’m saying. I’m saying the average fan 20 years from now will remember the Super Bowl winners and not the teams that made playoffs.
Because its real. just like it was with Brady
Because if I wasn't then why would I say I am
https://media.tenor.com/5Z-lf2IeYuUAAAAd/i-understood-that-reference-chris-evans.gif
I did! Jags +1800 payday softened the blow
Agreed. Like I said above I think the prime years begin around 27, so when Mahomes first arrived in 2018/2019 I was wondering how this dude could possibly get better in the next few years. Somehow that’s exactly what he’s done. Stats aren’t as insane as 2018, but he’s grown as a QB in terms of taking what the defense gives him and not necessarily looking for the killshot on every play. On every play he still gets the maximum amount of yardage possible. Right now this is the highest level of play I’ve ever seen from a QB aside from maybe early 2010s Rodgers or early 2000s Peyton.
Honestly the Super Bowl performance made me even more excited for the future. I was worried about what would happen when he can’t move as well and he damn sure proved he doesn’t have to scramble. And he has gotten better each year at those things so hopefully that will continue.
So what you’re saying is that the Chargers are the Anaheim Angels of the NFL?
The Chargers lack depth, but talent is usually more attributed to starters which the Chargers definitely have a lot of talented starters.
Imagine the drama if he made it into the league though...
Yall are my AFC Team, Fairweather as fuck idfc, iblove watching Mahomes and I legit enjoy watching vicariously through y'all.   The man, Andy, Kelce, Alex Smith, and all the other greats to come through this era have been a treat for football
This thread of comments is cracking my shit up.
But QB is one position on a team of 53, no?
It’s a Mahomes conference let’s be real
And one day, it will be you again.
American Eel mucous
Lost Wisconsinites
Only throwing in my two cents here as to hopefully give a little clarity as to why people think what you’re saying is wrong… nothing negative meant at all from me  I believe people are attempting to either agree but slightly tweak, countering, or downright disagreeing/arguing with your point simply b/c of the bit about - paraphrasing here - ‘the average fan remembering 20+ years from now.’ Like, I get what you’re saying and all, but it’s just kind of an odd metric to repeatedly use as a franchise’s determination of its own success.   Anyway, I hope that that didn’t come across as condescending and hope it helps
And the average team every year is not necessarily trying to be remembered by the average fan 20 years from now.
Most people on this thread probably wouldn't be able to name last twenty winners if Brady hadn't won most. I would almost take a guess most fans probably don't remember the superbowl and are more interested in who they are going to pick in 1st round.
In the Paper, the news, every day I am
I fucking love reddit because of this deeplore type shit posting.
his first couple years in the league there was alot of talk of his intelligence and how he has a photographic memory so there was a big expectation that he would master the mental side and get better from there
People parrot the "taking what the defense gives him" line all the time, but it's not really true. His best season ever was his rookie year, also one of the best in history.   Not necessarily because he was at his most skilled – moreso that his defense was so bad that Reid was unable to call a conservative game, and other defenses weren't wise yet on how to defend him (e.g. two high and stop blitzing) – but he never really had any weaknesses to begin with.  He scrambles less now just in response to the defensive looks and lack of necessity, but whenever he has done it he's twice as successful as the next best QB in history. Other QBs like Peyton, Rodgers, Brady were about as good over short periods of time, but they did it more on 1st/2nd down and while ahead...not on 3rd/4th and long while down double digits. Which is when Mahomes *isn't* "taking what the defense gives him" and makes him unparalleled.
Los Angeles Chargers of San Diego
Wait... We need more than Mike Trout?
And if you don’t see how QB is more important than the other 52 then no point talking here.   My original point was Chargers are overhyped, and  now you’re trying to debate why Herbert is better  lol
It absolutely is.   And the rest of us are in hell
if it can happen to the packers it can happen to anybody
Well not for 10 years and that's like a lifetime in the NFL years.
No team runs their franchise to win and never win the championship, they will tank/blow up/add in hopes of building a championship team.
I am, wherever I say I am.
Sophomore*   I agree, the fact dude is able to convert at a high probability on 3rd and 4th down is nuts, and the “being down double digits” stat is absurd.   However, watching every chiefs game for the past 25 years, I definitely yell at Mahomes to take easy first downs. I don’t find myself yelling this as often, though.
Praise be Tyrannosaurus Jackhammer Yates.
Thanks for the work and OC. helps with the off-season woes
I remember reading an interview with Gary Kubiak about this.  Not sure why it stuck with me all these years but I remember Gary called Yates a “slappy”.  https://sports.yahoo.com/ms-silver_morning_rush_tj_yates_texans_combine_120511.html
TJ the tiger slayer Yates
He who was sent to deliver us from Cin-cinnati
squatting as soon as you can is part of recovery btw. you do it while not fully healed and it speeds up the process.
IRL teabag practicing
I just don’t understand why y’all hate on Kyler so much or hope he fails. Because he plays video games like 75% of 25 year olds?   It’s not like he’s some piece of shit like Deshaun Watson or Tyreek Hill who beat his pregnant GF and punched her in the stomach and broke his sons arm 🤷🏻‍♂️
What’s that like 205?
So I did want to point out this is incredibly impressive that so soon after surgery he can squat that much, but there’s a caveat. The ACL won’t limit you in squats, but it will limit you in quick, lateral movements. Tearing an ACL will essentially limit the amount of movement you can do side to side and if you’ve ever torn your ACL, taking a step sideways will make you feel like you have no stability at all in your knee. That’s the part of his progression you should pay attention to.
Fully expected people to come in here and criticize depth not knowing anything about his rehab.
I had similar surgery the same week but I haven’t gotten to the point of squatting a few hundred pounds yet. He must have real life double xp.
Dudes gonna be solid 11 weeks next season
Doesn’t look like he’s squatting 600 lbs @ Jalen Hurts
What, squatting on his computer chair GAMING
Using Fisher Price weight plates, I see.
With a few more weeks of recovery he will even be able to squat with decent range of motion
Read that as [Vulnerable] Kyler Murray for a second there
Something, something, suprised he's not playing COD! Upvotes to the left please.
He’s the same height as me but he always looks so small. Idk how to explain it. Maybe I’m just used to most NFL players being giants
So what, it's Kyler Murray
Not impressed till I see him playing Madden while doing recovery
Squatting isn’t a big deal… his lateral movement and trusting his knee is
Turn your toes out
Stop trying to make k1 happen. It's not going to happen.
I have an irrational hatred for that god damn eyeball emoji
When you're 5'3" a squat is really more of a slight bend
Poor form but what else do you expect from an 8 year old.
See you in 2024 pal
Trash 😂😂
Can’t make an NFL tweet without the 👀  It’s illegal
Did he grow?
May lead the league in squats and shitty decisions.
Is he working on his thumbs though, that's pretty critical for KTD ratios
Also, not to mention 13 weeks post surgery is over 3 months. That is a perfectly normal timeline lol.
Helps with scar tissue too
Yeah I sure the anatomy is different, but I had pretty serious hip surgery a few years ago and was doing leg press two days after surgery
What is this physical therapy you speak of?
> I just don’t understand why y’all hate on Kyler so much or hope he fails. Because he plays video games like 75% of 25 year olds?  I think a lot of people forget how young these guys are. I also think people who give him shit fall into two camps - those who are just poking fun and don't actually dislike him, and those who weirdly seem to get off on hating him.
> Because he plays video games like 75% of 25 year olds?  lol right? Like he could be out driving drunk or getting high in strip clubs or any other stupid ass thing but instead he's hanging out at home playing CoD and people get mad.
He also had a joke of a GM and unqualified HC.
I think Kyler will be a lot better without Kliff as a coach
People find ways to hate Dak, even though he’s a good QB and a great person.
Oh I dislike kyler because he plays in the same division as us but as a player. As a person he’s seems pretty cool
He just gives off strong lil bitch energy vibes, looks like the Chucky doll, and throws temper tantrums on the field.   Besides that, he is the #1 best guy ever.
I mean he’s not the most likeable guy based on his personality. Seems a bit cocky and immature, also him refusing the play at the end of his playoff game didn’t do him any favors. Is it justified? Probably not. But it’s not hard to understand why he rubs a lot of people the wrong way
For me there is 2 types of hate     Hate for players that means I find them anywhere from annoying to thinking they are a little bitch, people like Kyler, Aaron Rodgers, Dak, Tae, and Suh     Then there's hate because they are just horrible people, such as Deshaun, Big Ben, Tyreek, Ja Morant, Brett Favre, so on
I hate him because im an A’s fan and he did them dirty.
It’s because he sucks
I think it’s mild jealousy tbh. This sub is full of aging millennials and he’s the first Gen Z “star”. Basically he’s a young dude that’s average height and jealousy creeps in that it wasn’t them who was born gifted enough and with the resources (world-class athlete parents) to become an NFL QB.   You can tell yourself you would never make it cause you’re not 6’3”+ but getting older and seeing a dude their size living the dream of being an NFL QB while still having time for CoD they look for reasons to get bitter
People said the same thing about Ben Simmons.  There’s some commonalities there.
fwiw I hate on Russ and Wentz too and they seem like good dudes.  They're just unlikable, and I don't feel bad about it cuz it's punching up not down.
A poor work ethic from the distraction of video games can affect a player's performance which means fans have to watch an inferior product.   Domestic abuse doesn't matter if you can run fast or throw the ball good.   That's how fans interests align with that of the owners.
Horrible take. Are 75% of 25 year olds NFL quarterbacks with their salaries being entirely funded, directly or indirectly, through their fans?  If I’m 25 years old and can play video games and do my order-taking or random entry level job effectively, does it really matter? No. Because I am delivering on my work commitment and enjoying my personal time.  The issue is when you’re paid hundreds of millions of dollars, you are expected to be elite at your craft. Whatever that craft may be. So yes, Kyler has much higher expectations and responsibilities than 99.999% of 25-year olds. Why the fuck should I empathize with a 25-year old multi hundred millionaire who doesn’t take his job seriously? Especially when I am the “main customer” of his product? Man, it must be really difficult for people under 25 years old to grasp the concept of accountability because you clearly don’t want to hold him accountable.  Fucking idiotic take. You’re not an idiot, but drawing an analogy between Kyler Murray and “75% of 25 year olds” lacks critical thinking.  Edit: The issue is everyone is complacent with his good performance without recognizing the fact that he could be a generational talent if he dedicated his time to and took the QB position as seriously as he should. If you’re a Cardinals fan and OK with your 1st overall pick blowing off film time for a video game, you don’t deserve a championship. You’re paid hundreds of millions. Fucking work hard. Why doesn’t anyone expect people to work hard anymore? Effort is easy, because it doesn’t require a generational talent to work hard.  Edit 2: If I were getting paid hundreds of millions of dollars to do my job, you better fucking bet I’d be the first person in the “office” and last person out. Unless I, of course, didn’t give two flying fucks about the person or people paying me. But then I’d be a real piece of shit for taking the money and fucking off. Must be a terrible person for not holding myself to a high standard.  Edit 3: Anyone notice how highly successful champions (e.g., Brady, Manning, Mahomes, Brees, etc.) who are adored by their fanbases, were never were critiqued for their work effort, but rather praised for it? Keep dreaming that the kid who wants to hit the sticks on Friday night instead of dreaming up ways to tear defenses apart is going to win. Absolute pipe dream.  Edit 4: Let’s summarize the situation for those downvoting me:   QB gets drafted 1st overall and signs 9-figure extension.  It’s Friday night and QB can:  1) Watch game film, improve his decision making, and thrives with the idea of finding ways to exploit defensive schemes.  2) Play Call of Duty and get the K/D ratio up.  QB chooses option 2, exhibits very poor decision making, does not play effectively in highly competitive, high stakes games, and continues to rely on raw athleticism for his regular season success.  Fans of QB: “WHY ARE YOU SO HARD ON HIM U JELLY BRO? HE JUST LIKES COD MAN FUCKING RELAX BOOMER”  Have fun in perpetual mediocrity.
I can't quite tell the weights but 205 if red is 45, blue is 25, and yellow is 10.  255 if red is 45, blue is 35, and yellow is 25.
TIL I squat as much as kyler Murray (post injury, I require a red Bull and peak strength)
Might be 255 but I wouldnt count that depth as a full squat tbh
Looks like it, yes.
245 or 255 depending on the bar
Yea, makes sense, since I don’t think he should be squatting heavy at this point   Probably just trying to get the knee comfortable under some weight
Lol at all these awful guesses in the response. You can tell the people who have never worked with colored plates.  If those are traditional weights (Not all gyms follow the standard)  Red = 55Blue = 45Yellow = 35Bar = 45  So it's probably 315  Edit: The red is a 45, so its 255
No only 140
2 weeks after I broke my wrist I ran a 7 minute mile…that’s not impressive to you?  /s
Yeah but as soon as you have ACL surgery your quads atrophy in like a week. Rebuilding muscle is a big part of ACL rehab  205 seems decent at this mark, but about right for a professional athlete
Exactly.  It's all about the specific injury. After my acl, I was back to squatting body weight in a month. And I am *not* an athlete.
He has different perks active in his class
Thank god someone was here to make the same joke I've seen 200 other times, it's still just as funny
But his 5’7, 180 pound WR teammate can
To be honest I don't think Johnny Venerable is even a real name
I think he looks so small because he's built like a bulldog. It's weird to see a guy who is like 5'9-5'10 with tree trunk size thighs and I think it creates some sort of optical illusion where he looks compacted or something lol
You can't possibly know what stance is best for his hip morphology based on one short clip from this angle lol
I mean, it is his Instagram handle...
The short jokes are kinda lame
I’m pretty tall and videos like this make me wonder where the cutoff point is for when being taller (albeit with more mass) affects squatting and other lifts.
Hahahahah you said the thing!!!! Hahahaha!!!!!!
Kylr Mury short and don't do homework hahahehe
boy you probably on that zeke diet without any of the workout plan, foh
205 3 months post surgery is good though?   Being on timeline for major injuries isn’t something to dismiss
Exactly  Saying 13 weeks  Sounds a lot faster than just over 3 months   Wish him best but this tweet is a joke lol
Yeah, studies have found that putting less weight on a post ACL surgery knee increases risk for osteoarthritis in that knee.  Now that doesn't mean overload the knee, but it's good for typical recovery to add planned stress to the knee to strengthen it.

Well, I mean, we get mad at that shit too ya know.  It's just frustration that this dude has an opportunity that like .000001% of people have and yet he's basically fucking it off.  At least that's what it looks like to some of us.
And a terrible owner
He did great Aaron Rodgers act
It's pretty easy to start disliking him after he encouraged fans to throw things at the refs when he lost that playoff game. That was his fault, he fucked up and couldn't accept responsibility for his failure, and then wished harm on the refs who were completely right in how they officiated that ending. I don't care about the Cowboys at all, we rarely play them and haven't lost to them in like 30 years, but that was a very public way to learn a little about who Dak really is.
[removed]
No one was talking about Josh Allen and Mac Jones lmao
“Temper tantrums on the field” = getting pissed off that your college failure of a head coach consistently isn’t getting play calls in on time and you’re burning timeouts and taking delay of games almost every single week, AND you’re losing games when you’re getting paid $200 million plus dollars to win them.  Do you want him to not care? To not try?  More proof that it’s damned if you do, damned if you don’t for Kyler.  He doesn’t do that stuff and people will say he doesn’t care about the game.  Meanwhile, Brady does it when guys can’t get lined up right and the same crowd is all “wow what a winner, he wants to win so badly! Break another iPad while you’re at it!”
And honestly, this may not even be fair to him- but somehow his voice during interviews sounds fake. Like he tries to deepen it. I do not know why, but that is the thing that pisses me off so bad about him.
Seems a bit cocky and immature? People said the same things about guys like Rodgers and Brady when they were young. Not sure why a $200 million dollar starting NFL QB is supposed to be demure.
Fair as a fan but that’s 100% on the A’s for making that mistake.   Everyone knew football was Kyler’s passion and he only played baseball because he was also freakishly talented at that too lol   He told them he was going back to Oklahoma to play football
lol this is just untrue but okay
Sounds like you just jump on hate trains
Kyler has never been so bad he should be benched or something. Not even close.   When he had a healthy O-line and a non suspended Deandre Hopkins he was playing at an MVP level.   Too many people in here are just unoriginal and recycle the same narrative about the dude lol
You ok man? No need to have a mental breakdown over downvotes and write a book about it with 4 edits.
wtf, where have u seen a blue 25 or yellow 10?
Very true but depth is probably not  the objective for how soon he is in his recovery cycle.
If you aren't lifting for a powerlifting meet, depth is overrated. You train for a purpose, and if ass to grass doesn't help, who cares about depth.
Honestly though it's not bad compared to some football players I've seen and lord knows what you'll see in a commercial gym. Team Full ROM all the way tho.
You can clearly see the 45 on the red plate
Wtf thats insanely strong for being 13 weeks removed from acl surgery. Nfl athletes are really on a different level
It definitely is! I can still barely squat like this 12 years after my ACL surgery
If you don't like unfunny people and played out jokes nfl may not be for you pal  You can downvote me but you can't prove me wrong
Rondale Moore? I'm guessing but he's a thick dude
my handle is longdongmilfslayer69  can confirm, Instagram handles are not manifestations
You're talking about the sub that has beaten HAHAHA WHITE WR LUNCHPAIL GUY and DAE KELVIN FAT LOL into the ground.
Your RB is a center. How's that for original
your average reddit user really thinks they're comedic geniuses by beating overused jokes into the fucking middle of the earth
Oh I’m definitely just an average American man, for NFL standards though, this boy is trash and overrated
>205 3 months post surgery is good though?  I'm just a redditor bud, I can't comment on whether or not that's good. But I do know that 3 months post surgery is a fine timeline for what he's currently doing.
205 is nothing his PR was prob over 405 as a pro athlete
That’s 255
205lbs isn’t a lot for a professional athlete, post injury or healthy.
That’s 255lbs. On the bar
What if I told you that knee supports 207 lbs every time he walks?
The weight pushed is relative to a person's training capacity. I wouldn't expect someone to be pushing >70% their 1-rep maximal. I'd have to assume 205 lbs is around 45-50% his training max
I'm 12 weeks post arthroscopic knee surgery, also right knee, had most of my medial meniscus removed because it couldn't be saved.   I hit a set of 10 at 300lb on the hack squat yesterday. Need to get someone to go with me so I've got a spotter before I get under the bar. Don't 100% trust it's stability yet.
Dude got drafted 1st overall in the NFL and top 10 in the MLB and you think he didn’t put work in?
I mean, he apologized and that doesn’t wipe away seven years of being an amazing professional and an even better person off the field.
Idk after romo called him Mr January this sub kinda turned on Allen
So I was just reading Kyler's Wikipedia page and it says that the A's gave him a 4.66 million signing bonus after drafting him.  Did Kyler have to pay that back or did he just keep that money even after he chose the NFL!?
That’s why the cardinals are such juggernauts
nah idc who other people like or dislike.  Some of these people just have a naturally unlikable public persona so yeah they tend to have more haters lol.  It works the other way too
Different brands have different colors. Not all bumper plates are "official" Olympic weights which do have standardized colors, if I'm not mistaken.
That might be all the ROM he safely has at the moment, but let's not act like going to depth is bad.  I don't mean ass to grass, I mean just to parallel.
depth is very much not overrated, depth helps you develop stronger knees and hip flexors, which can boost your speed and explosiveness
Agreed. I'd say 10% or less of ppl squatting at my gym break parallel
Who Wins?  Random Redditor vs Elite Athlete with an entire team of top tier professionals
O shit ur right, so everything moves down by 10.
I'm sure there's an NFL circlejerk sub for boring played out jokes
It's not a manifestation, it's a nickname. I don't think it's that serious, it's no different than TB12.
Yeah I had significant knee surgery 2 years ago. Wasn’t allowed to put weight on it for 3 months but as soon as I could walk again my surgeon told me to start pushing it as hard as I could.
>I'm just a redditor bud,   sorry y'all didn't mean to offend the redditors
Now is the perfect time to mention Jalen Hurts can squat 600lbs.    Didn’t know if any of you knew that.
Idk why this was downvoted lol it’s light weight for a pro athlete or even person that lifts weight consistently
Depends on the injury. When I tore my acl, I was back to squatting in the low 200s (body weight) in about a month. But it took over a year to get back to 3 plates. My best friend fucked up his knee in some other complex way and wasn't allowed to squat more than the bar for half a year.
I haven’t worked out in like a year and can still squat 300 lol this is really nothing  Edit: lol at the downvotes from morons who haven’t touched a weight in their lives.
Where are you getting 255 from?   Bar= 45  Red= 45x9 is 90 so at 135  Blues= 25x2=50 so 185  Yellow= 10x2=20 so 205
What if I told you it’s supporting an additional 255 on top of that 207
Shit, love to hear the progress!   Yeah the mental aspect is half the battle. I know it's easier said than done but trust your body and trust your PTs. Your body can handle a lot and PTs have helped with recovery hundreds of times and have a plan.
Losing any portion of your meniscus will impair your knee's mechanical stability. The meniscus is supposed to provide depth for the femoral condyle to seat. You lost some portion of that. It's smart to give yourself time to build up motor control.
Eh, you find out who a person is in the moment, not after they've consulted with their PR team. Your comment was that people find ways to hate Dak as if we were looking for them. You have to remember that outside of Dallas, or even Texas in general, most NFL fans aren't following Dak. We follow our own teams. So when he did that right after a primetime playoff loss in front of the cameras, there were a lot of people watching that don't know anything about him other than what they had just seen.
He never got paid the $4.66M since it was over X amount of time played   He repaid like a million and change when he decided to go to the NFL instead lol
Maybe Mahomes has skewed your perspective man
Kyler wasn’t the problem that game, his o line got mauled by us. People forget that our defense was unreal in the postseason
Backing you up here. Official olympic plates are color coded the same, and they're measured in Kg. If those were olympic plates, those are 25kg plates, 20kg plates, and 15 kg plates (which I doubt, because "Murica")  If those were kg plates, he's squatting 140kg (around 308. Similar to two 45lb plates and one 35lb plate on each side.)  But yeah, pretty sure they're American plates 45lb, 35lb, and 25lb. So 255lbs.
Yeah, agreed. ATG is overrated but let’s not start saying half reps are acceptable
Yes it's this sub
Intended as a lighthearted joke, nothing more
If you can walk to the squat rack, you should be able to put your ass to the fucking grass with three plates bro.   -this guy’s doctor probably
...Do you have a point?
Don't know why you're getting downvoted, that was a hilarious response.
Cool thanks
Bc it’s being downvoted by folks sitting at home who have no idea about going to the gym/weightlifting
I think people are downvoting for the “post injury” part. 205 could be considered a lot for a guy still recovering from a major surgery, it just depends on what stage of recovery he’s in.
What about for a hobbit?
more evidence kyler is lazy by not maxing out after 3 months of rest
Idk either. Your average gym goer should be able to rep out 205 after a few months.
I squat 405 with better form and I’m fat. We are both 5’7” though. My wife can hit 225 1rm and she’s 110 lbs lol this has nothing to do with his progress post sx good or bad
~~how can you tell those are the weights?~~  ~~in my powerlifting gym, bar is 20 kg, reds are 25 kgs (55 lbs), blues are 20 kgs (44 lbs), yellows are 15 kgs (33 lbs). that would put this at 140 kg, or 308 lbs~~  ~~it's my understanding that's generally the norm for weightlifting gyms as well~~  ~~but i can't say for certain that's the case here because maybe it's weird weights or something~~  edit: nm, i see that the red has a 45 on it. god damn it
The yellows are 25lb plates. The 10’s are on the top rung of the squat rack  Those plates aren’t colored like competition plates are.  Red’s are 45lb, blues are 35lb, yellows are 25lb
Blues are 35, yellows are 25
Huh. Never seen that type of plate before. At my gym, the only plates that are colored are bumper plates; and red ones are 55, blue 45, and yellow 25 maybe? Thought he was squatting more because of it.
Had my final PT today actually. Them and my surgeon said the same thing - if it doesn't hurt, do it. My biggest issue was my leg wouldn't go fully straight. They are still blown away by my strength progress though to get where I am.   My surgeon was AMAZING. This doc has a nice strong resume.   She's the Michigan State Football, Hockey, and Basketball teams orthopedic doc. Also men's and women's soccer teams. She was the Ortho doc for the Cleveland marathon. She was one of the docs for the NCAA basketball tournament.   I found all that out, applied to be a patient, they reviewed my case and took me on.   Just need to keep at it. I agree 100% though that mental is huge. I want to get under that bar but until I've got a spotter lined up I'm holding back. I'll probably get tired of waiting, use some knee wraps, and start light.
I would rather take years off being a stand-up guy than a benign comment made after a crushing playoff loss. But you do you.
They are fine as long as you are doing them for a reason (as in this case, Kyler was probably instructed not to go to full depth).  If your squats look like Kyler and that's as low as you ever go, you are doing yourself a disservice and you're most likely hurting your knees.
ATG has like insane diminishing returns once you go past 90 right?
Nice edit about the downvote after you downvoted me in the first place lol, soft
I saw your comment for what it was.
He’s also just a redditor so probably not!
Honestly it's much funnier downvoted
In this context it’s Kyler Murray and 3 months post surgery. It’s not a lot.
Not as impressive as if it were a dwarf, but more impressive than if it were a goblin doing those squats.
Less ROM so they might be able to do a decent amount
Your average gym goer isn't 3 months removed from acl surgery.
I almost made the same comment. Stupid companies not all being color coordinated.
So fucking weird that these are all lighter than the usual internationally standardized bumpers. Should be 315.
Olympic Weightlifter here, my first thought was that was 140kg on the bar til i saw the reds were 45lb plates.
Yeah the leg not fully straightening after knee surgery is very common. During recovery, if the leg isn't kept straight enough, it can lead to the muscles basically locking up in a slightly bent position. But it's far from unfixable. I assume they gave you some exercises for it.  Yeah man, coming from a former athletic trainer for a power 5 school, the medical staff for college programs are usually top notch. She probably did your surgery 100 times before and I have no doubt she did a great job on it.
Years of a carefully cultivated PR persona for a multi-billion organization vs Dak saying what he really thinks without anyone coaching him what to say. Like you said, you do you. Gotta support the franchise no matter what, I think a lot of Browns fans felt the same when they signed Watson. But don't pretend like people are looking for a reason to hate him when his own actions did that perfectly well.
I don't downvote people you jerkoff, I'm not 7  You'd have to be soft to even concern yourself with imaginary points on the internet
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ win some and lose some
Nah see you didn't say exactly that in your post tho. Using critical thinking skills like that is asking a lot from a redditor.
Where do Gnomes fall in this list?
Lol this, dudes range of motion is like less than a foot for squatting I bet
I know. He’s a professional athlete. 205 should be light work for him ACL injury or not.
You know that fitness companies trademark their color schemes? You'd get your ass sued for replicating another companies color coding. Idiotic, I know.
Yeah, some companies use their own color system. Sometimes it throws me off when I go to different gyms lol. For example, Eleiko plates:   * Blue = 45 pounds * Yellow = 35 pounds * Green = 25 pounds     Throwdown Fitness plates:       * Red = 45 pounds * Blue = 35 pounds * Yellow = 25 pounds * Green = 10 pounds
You have no idea how well you’re proving my point
You're concerned enough to edit your comment to whine about them
Call me when you find a gnome that can squat more than 135
Competition plates all use the same color scheme. More of a complaint that it’s not industry standard. Red 45’s next to blue not 45’s and yellow not 15 kgs (33ish lbs) looks gross.
I was a fitness professional for like a decade and still frequent gyms. Have yet to see some companies like throwdown that try to buck the “system.” Wild. Though I probably sound like a crazy 38 year old boomer.   Anyway… You’d think they’d take the cue on color that Eleiko and the other 20 most prominent brands follow. Just don’t use red, blue, yellow, green. And in that order.
No, what I was doing was pointing out that your downvotes don't change the fact that this forum is filled with not funny people doing played out jokes.  I don't expect someone like you to understand obvious shit though.
[Don't blame me on the music, but my search history will be interesting for a bit](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/FDrLy_j8QnM)
Those companies probably pay a licensing deal with the weight lifting federation to use those colors. Any non-sanctioned manufacturers can't use those schemes.
I should just make a novelty account with the same flair for this and every other sad/mad “which game blah blah blah” question that comes up. Because you already know the answer.
Recently, 13 seconds. But Wide Right still haunts me.
Nothing compares to 28-3
As a Bengals fan… Bengals losing to the Steelers in 2016.   The game was over. All they had to do was run the clock. Jeremy Hill’s dumb ass fumbles on a “just don’t fumble” run. Burfict decides to CTE Antonio Brown on an uncatchable 3rd down pass. Pac-Man and Burfict try to fight a Steelers coach and push a ref if I remember correctly. All the penalty yards give the Steelers a chip shot field goal to win.
There was a certain Super Bowl I don't wanna talk about it man, I need a drink.
"The Lions find themselves in a very familiar position. For 16 weeks, starting in Atlanta back in September, they took the field thinking this was gonna be their day. Sixteen times they were wrong, and now there are no Sundays left. By record, they are the worst team in league history. Zero and sixteen, those are the numbers that will forever be associated with the Detroit Lions."
hmmmmm
The broncos destroying us in the Super Bowl was brutal. I invited my friends and family over to eat chilli I worked hard on to watch me cry while my heroes were defiled.  Edit: I forgot to mention I lost a fantasy hockey bet that year, and my friend made me wear a New Jersey devils jersey while I watched.  What a bad day
Allbright and his ex 😢
DeSean Jackson’s punt return
Double doink
I’m a Lions fan. How much time do you have???
Justin tucker nfl record fg 66 yards to beat us
Probably 2014 Divisional vs Packers. Not even for the whole Dez caught it stuff, but just the fact that was the best team Romo ever had around him, and it ended up being his final season essentially. Really thought that we were getting Brady-Romo in the SB.  2016 vs Packers sucked but I was optimistic thinking we had a team that would be contending for years to come. I was kind of right but kind of not.
Jags dropping 45 on us at Heinz Field in the playoffs.
Taking sb51 and my own fandom out of it I’d say the saints nfc championship game. No one wanted NO to lose more than me but if that happened to us or anyone without a sb ring we would still be bitching about it to this day and Im real enough to admit it.
My team? Myles Jack wasn’t down   In general, I’ll try to think outside the box and say the Panthers loss to the Patriots in the Super Bowl. The kick out of bounds setting up great field position for Tom.   Also knowing what we know now with the falcons 28-3. That franchise has never recovered which makes it sadder
28-3. And after that I’ll have to say the Texans melt down to the Chiefs in 2019 when you have the added context of everything that came after  I mean in the course of one day, it felt like that loss just broke everything in Houston. Yeah that team wasn’t perfect, but going into that afternoon, Houston KC, Watson Mahomes, that seemed destined to be the next rivalry that dominated the AFC.   And in one afternoon, it all ended
I'd rather not talk about it
Mile High Miracle.
The Justin Tucker 66 yard kick.  Literally broke an NFL record just to beat the Lions with 0 on the clock.
For all Dolphins fans scrolling. Marino going out on a 62-7 loss to the Jaguars,in the playoffs, on his last chance to snag a ring.
I was going to say the packers/Seahawks NFC championship game lmao I literally blocked out the very next game that happened 🤣🥲
Every chargers game I’ve ever seen
For me it’ll always be the 2015 Texans playoff loss at home to the Chiefs.   We started that season 2-6, ended it 9-7. We accomplished this starting a carousel of Brian Hoyer, Ryan Mallett, TJ Yates, and Brandon Weeden at QB. Our defense after the week 8 (I think?) bye was allowing fewer points per game than the elite 2015 Broncos who won the SB with the corpse of Peyton Manning.   We lost 30-0 and, somewhere around Brian Hoyer’s 3rd of 5 turnovers, JJ Watt, trying to carry the team on his back as usual, suffered the back injury that marked the end of his peak.    Nothing stings like that because of JJ.
It has to be they Cardinals vs Steelers Super Bowl ! They literally snatched that trophy out of Larry Fitzgeraldz soul when James Harrison returned that interception for a touchdown smh
KYLE WILLIAMS
1 yard….
I was suuuuper bummed about the 9ers and eagles game last year.  Brock was such a cool story and I was so excited to see how far he could go. Then In the first bit of it his elbow is fucked  It wasn’t just the game that was over, it was what happens to brock now?  Idk I hated all of it
SB42
1998-1999 NFC championship game where Gary Anderson missed his first field goal the entire year to lose.  The Vikings had such a good team that year and looked way stronger than the broncos they would have faced in the super bowl.
\*sigh\*   **DII^(III)GGS!!!**  **SIDELIIINE!!!**  **TOUCHDOWN!!!!!**  With that out of the way, it was the 2018 non-call
Honestly probably the Titans coming up 1 yard short of a superbowl. They arnt my team but it's still hard to watch.
I was so happy when the giants beat the undefeated pats but the look on junior seaus face with the confetti falling down was definitely heartbreaking to me.
2014 NFC Championship game. Green Bay historic meltdown vs Seattle.
Raiders probably win the AFC West that year (And the #2 seed) if Carr doesn't go down.  Obviously I hate the Raiders but man that would suck to have that be your best shot at competing.  For mine... probably the 2018 AFC Championship. There was despair, there was hope, there was A LOT of hope, there was despair again, then hope again, and then the dread of defeat.
The 1998 Vikings losing the NFCCG to the Falcons in OT after Vikes kicker Gary Anderson missed the 1 and only FG that season.
Seahawks vs Patriots super bowl. There are to this day Seahawk players that haven't gotten over the decision to pass instead of running beast mode for the go ahead TD. Honestly there isn't anything close...
13 seconds
That SB game that broke an entire team due to a single ill-advised play.
1971 Christmas Day Chiefs vs Miami 2 1/2 ot  quarters chiefs lose on a field goal. Longest game in NFL history
Super bowl 56 😔
I’m a raven fan so 2011 vs NE in the AFCCG…and probably for the regular season the bengals beating us in 2017 in the final minute of the game (thanks Maurice Canady)…HM is Antonio brown reaching over the goal line on Christmas Day in 2016…there’s a couple of older ones too but these three broke my heart the most.
IT WAS A FUMBLE.
The no call. At least Minnesota made a sick play during the miracle and we lost fair and square.   Saints were robbed in 2018
2002 WC game against the 49ers. Last time I cried over sports.
I think there was a Saints (?) game where they completed all the laterals and scored a wild kickoff return touchdown, the thing every team tries and fails to do, every is going crazy, then the kicker shanked the extra point and they lost.  Edit: I was sort of wrong. It was a [last second pass with three laterals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTGco82JKHo). Saints vs Jags. Absolutely crazy miracle play, the John Carney missed the extra point. And this was 2007, so that was from the two-yard line lol
I’m a packer fan. Insert playoff game in the 21st century. The amount of super bowls we’ve missed because of the front office or pure player stupidity is just aggravating. However, 2009 when Favre threw a pick in OT (in the NFC title game) with his last season with the packers was heartbreaking for a 13 year old me (as I did not know he was a piece of shit).
~~Superbowl 49~~ Nothing comes to mind.
Tuck. Rule.
Super Bowl 50
Well shit…where do I begin?
There are 3 obvious answers and all of them involve the Patriots playing in the Superbowl
When the Lions lost due to the 10 second runoff rule against the falcons in 2017. Ended up costing us a playoff spot and Jim Caldwell his job, iirc
I was at a super bowl party with about 99% giants fans when we went 18-1.
Look, it's recent pain, but being in the stadium for The Bills' Bengals loss this postseason tortured my fucking soul. Worst part is I knew it was coming. Before Hamlin's medical emergency they were looking like they were gonna open a can of whoop-ass on us.   I just had this uneasy feeling. Then, once I saw the first drive, I knew we were in for a long, long night of more patented Leslie Frazier playoff defensive pain. And, so it would be. That may be near the most deflated I've ever felt in my life, walking out of the stadium. I went right back to our hotel and went right to sleep, didn't even say a word once we had left the stadium parking lot.  Honestly, I can handle 13 Seconds, or things like that, where one crucial play fucks us, because you can rationalize yourself that if things had gone *just a bit different*, you would have made it through. With a game like Cincy, where we were thoroughly dominated from the get go to the final bell, I find those much harder, because for the whole team to go flat for the whole game is just inexplicably more painful.
For me, Justin Tucker hitting an NFL record field goal to beat Detroit. It basically summed up my entire life as a Lions fan.
NFC Championship Saint Vikings the things, the refs let those dudes do to Brett Favre was crazy
Super Bowl LIV. Especially after picking off Mahomes for the second time. Oh Kyle, why didn’t you learn anything from 28-3?   Kyle Williams also comes to mind too.
13 seconds.  Score the go ahead TD with 13 seconds left and then lose in the playoffs.  It's worse than wide right.
Texans 2020 playoff loss to Chiefs 😞
The Super Bowl last year and it isn’t close. Was the the first season I had even seen a bengals playoff win, such a fun season and just ended with heartbreak.
28-3?
28-3 without a doubt. I’d be sick if I were a falcons fan.
For me, the 2013 NFCCG loss to Seattle hurt more than either of the SB losses. The fact that it happened at the peak of the Niners-Seahawks rivalry, that Sherman got the last laugh, that Bowman got injured the way that he did, and that afterwards it really felt like that core group's window was closing combined to make it worst for me. Seeing Denver barely put up a fight against Seattle two weeks later didn't help matters lol.
We lost two Super Bowls
Double doink
Colts losing to the Steelers in the playoffs in like 05.
It was a fumble.  Literally everyone admits it now and always chuckle like it's funny that the sport is that corrupt, which I guess it is funny. It makes me angry because I was there and all, but it doesn't do to take this shit seriously.
The sloppy wet chiefs groundsman Super Bowl.
Regular Season: Miracle at the New Meadowlands.  Post Season: 2008 hurt as a Giants fan, but that's not the worst I've felt watching a playoff game. 2015 playoffs, I was watching with a Vikings fan. Zimmer and Bridgewater were both easy to root for, so I also got invested in seeing them win. My friend had calluses from past pain, but I foolishly believed that there was no way a field goal that short would be missed. But it got even more heartbreaking because of what happened to Teddy in the off-season.
'97 NFC championship game. We were never in it, and when my dad and I got home, after a 2.5 hour drive, my mom had gotten a new dog. My dad walks by the dog, "He's probably a fucking Packers fan"
I’m a Seahawks fan so I’ll let you guess
Buffalo Bills losing Superbowl XXV.
Music City Miracle. My first and last Bills playoff game for quite some time.
Bills Vs KC post season 2021  Ugh.
Idk happened just a couple weeks ago. Think we are getting the ball back to win it, celebrating a stop and then someone in the room says wait, there’s a flag
Maybe not the most heartbreaking but the way the rams beat the saints for the 2018 nfcc was pretty horrible. After that we had to watch that horrible super bowl game and the saints prolly could have won that one
any answer that isnt helmet catch is wrong.
Niners losing to eagles last season because we literally ran out of QBs.
Let's not play this game
The same ol’ lions specialty
As a bills fan that wasn’t alive for the Super Bowl run in the 90’s, 13 seconds without a doubt
Lions fan here; which year are you asking about?
Ravens at Titans divisional round 2008 season. Cold and wet January night. The Ravens didn’t win that game. The Titans lost it.
2018 NFCCG vs Rams, fucking dipshit refs cost the Saints a Super Bowl appearance
Seahawks passing at the 1 yard line, and it’s not even close.
For my team, eh, not sure; the loss to the Rams in the divisional two years ago sucked, but they were so far out of it anyways the fact the comeback didn't 100% happen means it's not as bad, plus still had the Super Bowl afterglow.  The 1999 NFCCG loss was bad, but a team with that offense had no business being there, regardless of how the defense did.  That being said, for any team, I literally cannot imagine a situation where it does not involve the numbers "28" and "3".
I’m a falcons fan so…
Allbright losing his mind on Twitter yesterday, probably
Browns losing to the Chiefs in 2020 to not advance to the championship game
28-3
2009 NFC Championship game…as you can tell I’m a vikes fan. That one emotionally tormented me
Not including 28-3 I'd probably go with the Bengals vs Steelers playoff game where Palmer blew out his knee.
Russell Wilson intercepted by Malcolm Butler at the goal line.
The day Snyder bought our franchise
Desean Jackson
As a Seahawks fan, you know it, I know it, everyone knows it.
The Jesse James game.
The answer to all these variations on the same theme posts is the Falcons.
Nope can't think of any for us
Tim.  Tebow.
Check my flair and don't even get me started
I don't like this game
Justin Tucker from New Zealand around the corner from BFE, off the crossbar and over to mercilessly deny MCDC of his first win yet again.
Bills vs Chiefs in overtime...
Bills vs Chiefs in OT, and Scott Norwood wide right.
10 second runoff
As a Steelers fan.  When we beat Arizona in the Super Bowl. I love that we won, but damn I would've loved to see Fitz get a ring.
If seeing it on TV counts, the Eagles losing to Tampa Bay in the 2004 NFC Championship game. It was the last football game at Vet Stadium and "everyone" knew the Eagles were going to the Super Bowl. Well, "everyone" was wrong. They lost 27-10.  I've heard the crowd was so quiet walking out that you could have heard a coin drop.
13 seconds and double doink. Near the top of any list, esp because both happened in the final 13 seconds of a Conference Championship game.  You can also say 13 seconds and double doink, and virtually every fan of a NFL team will know exactly what games, and probably even the years, that each happened. If you need a paragraph to explain how your Bengals or Vikings loss was heartbreaking, it’s not generally very heartbreaking.  28-3 probably tops the list though
- Jets loss to the Steelers 2010 AFC championship  - 2015 Jets loss to Bills week 17  - Jets 2020 win against the Rams/Browns (this is a loss in my eyes lmao)
Oilers loss the the Bills in THAT playoff game 🙁🤦🏼‍♂️
Spoiled Pats fan. 2007 undefeated season does not get talked about in New England.
Going 15-1, burying the Cardinals 49-15 in the NFCC, then losing shamefully to Peyton's Ponies.  Every time I see that forehead I am reminded of failed ambitions and the chaotic agony of existence.
As bad as 28-3 was, I think the Malcolm Butler play is so much worse. I can’t imagine being a Seattle fan that night.
Read my flair and take a guess
the tuck rule game  28-3  Myles Jack wasn’t down   Saints Vs Vikings playoff game  Panthers sb loss to the pats  Myles Jack wasn’t down   Panthers SB loss to the broncos   The beastquake game when marshawn lynch did the thing   Myles Jack wasn’t down   I’m a jags fan but the chargers loss to us where they were up 28-0 has got to be heart breaking  Myles Jack wasn’t down   The jets buttfumble game
For me personally? Miracle in the Meadowlands 2 when Matt Dodge punted the ball in a straight line at Desean Jackson and won the game on a punt return.   I had to go to a friends birthday in Massachusetts the Saturday before and texted as many people as I could I’d be recording the game and to not let me know how it goes. I drove two almost 3 hours home not listening to the radio in fear of hearing any updates or scared to look at my phone. Right before I got home I looked at my phone cause a buddy who never ever watched or cares about football texted me.   All he said was “man you must be real pissed right now”. But I knew something bad had happened. I got home and watched it my dad and brother as they got excited and we built a massive lead. And that only confirmed the ensuing collapse. I didn’t say anything. I just pretended to be excited.   Pretending to be excited made it a lot worse.
Homer pick: Super Bowl 32, or the 2014 NFCCG.  Non-homer pick: 28-3, easily.
jeremy hill fumble. wild card weekend. 2016
Titans vs Rams Superbowl Dyson one yard short. It is a damn shame Eddie George and Steve McNair didn't win one.
#DOUBLE DOINK
Saints in 2019 had to suck 😂😂😂😂
Hahahahahahahahahahahaha
That double doink was bad.    But the no call pass interference Rams vs Saints was rough. And I am not a Saints fan, I can only imagine
How much time you got?
How much time you got buddy?
As a Chargers fan, I don't know where to even start
Seahawks vs patriots in superbowl 49 will forever be in my memory being a seahawks fan
When the Colts lost to the Texans the last game of this past season.
The one where they didn't give Marshawn the ball at the one yard line
Vikings vs Seahawks. Playoffs. Wide left by our kicker. I'm so salty still... I'm not even gonna say his name.
Afc championship game between Chiefs and Patriots. I can get over it now but my god did the dee ford call shatter my night. However, the moment that hurt nearly as much was for a certain goal line interception that helped the patriots as well, the sting even for me Seattle
What about the playoff loss against the cowboys vs seahawks … All the damn plays were run run run run and they knew it too .. so dumb
Packers blowing a 16-0 lead against the Seahawks to go to the Super Bowl… that one was the most painful packers game I’ve ever watched
The Hail Murray had me upset for a week and it really didn’t matter in the grand scheme of things.
As a fan too young to see wide right live, it was 13 seconds for me. Our run felt magical that year and then it was dead in a matter of seconds. Truly tragic.
One. Yard. Short.
Currently the last game I watched
Double doink
I don’t want to talk about it anymore
“Should have gave the ball to Marshawn”
This is not Detroit man this is the Super Bowl!
Bengals losing to the Steelers in the playoffs after Burfict basically ruined the team's chances by paralyzing Brown.  That set up a chip shot and the Steelers advanced.  I was a big Bengals fan until a year or two after and they had such a great team during that run, yet Lewis couldn't coach himself out of a brown paper bag to bring the team to their true potential.  He's probably the worst playoff head coach of all time.
Bills. Scott Norwood….
Hard to pick just one.
Music city miracle…wasn’t there but damn I sure felt like I was 😭
It’s 28 - 3 without question.  As a Panthers fan, I loved every single second of it. It’s also the only time I’ve ever rooted for TB12
*googles Minnesota Vikings playoff results*
As a Vikings fan I can name off the top of my head:  Vikings losing to Seahawks at home in the playoffs on a missed 27 yard yard field goal  Vikings losing to the Saints in the playoffs during the BountyGate game where Favre threw that idiotic interception  Vikings losing to the Cardinals in game 16 on the last play, knocking them out of the playoffs in 2003  Gary Andersen missing the game sealing field goal - his only miss of the season - in the 98 NFC title game against the Falcons.   Darrin Nelson dropping the game winning TD in the 87 NFC championship game against Washington.   These are just from my time as a fan.
No call PI rams saints was pretty bad
The Butt-Fumble was like all the humiliation we’ve experienced up to that point, rolled up in a ball multiplied x2. Then God said, “I’m gonna alter this franchise forever by having ESPN is talk about this every week for an entire year”.   I’ve not enjoyed football since. I don’t think any Jet fan has. It really fucked the fanbase to this day.
Oilers vs Bills
I know it doesn't compare to most...but the 10 second runoff game against Atlanta a few years ago was a backbreaker. My wife and I both went to that game and had a great time...until we didn't.
Definitely the 1998 nfc championship.  We were supposed to be a team of destiny.
Lions vs cowboys
I had the misfortune of attending the Panthers 2008 Playoff game against the Arizona Cardinals, you know, the one where Jake Delhomme had 6 turnovers.  It was rough, but I will always remember that I had never seen an NFL stadium empty out so fast after a horrible half of football. I think by the end of the game, there was only a handful of Cardinals fans, and a select few diehard Panther fans. I just remember that my childhood QB was done.  To add salt to the wound, my Parents got me tickets to the immediate home opener after that playoff game as a graduation present, against the Eagles, where Jake Delhomme threw for 70 yards and had 4 ints.  At that point, there was no going back, and I knew he was done.  After that, the Panthers moved on, and I'll always remember [how emotional Delhommie was at his goodbye press conference.](https://www.panthers.com/video/delhomme-s-goodbye-1095004)
That Superbowl where the Falcons blew the Patriots away and still managed to loose.  If I was a Flacons fan  I don’t think I’d have survived it.
Blair Walsh
Viking w/ Favre versus the saints in the playoffs.  Obv given recent events it’s a lil hard to feel bad for the guy, but at the time it was a bummer to watch cause it felt like just everything that could go wrong did go wrong.
Lions vs. Cowboys playoff loss. Ref actually unsaw pass interference.
Losing to the rams in the NFC championship game for sure. We had the chance to win 4 times at Levi's south that year, and it would have been the greatest sendoff of Jimmy G.
Maybe not the most heartbreaking but the Vikings Seahawks 2016 WC game comes to mind. Playing in freezing conditions like that and to lose on that missed Walsh chip shot….I’d lose sleep for months
The Panther’s first SB against the Patriots was heartbreaking in the moment, especially after the out of bounds kick. But for a loss I actually remember, nothing beats the level of hype and excitement in 2015 leading up to a very depressing SB loss. I mean we absolutely destroyed a cardinals team some were saying was better than us, and so I had a peak high going into the SB, only making the loss that more heartbreaking
Any Lions game that ends with an Aaron Rodgers hail mary
For the Ravens, Pro Bowl QB Huntley making decisions. For any game, absolutely 28-3.
The "Dez caught it" game. Romo and Dez and Witten and Frederick ALL deserved at least a chance at winning that game. Is there a chance Rodgers still marches down the field and wins that game with the remaining time left? Sure. But I would have MUCH preferred that over an incredibly stupid NFL rule. Glad they changed the rule, but sad it had to happen like that.
Asante had a pick six if he had caught it.
Aside from the super bowls against fucking Eli, I’d say the wildcard loss to the Texans in 2020.  It wasn’t confirmed, but it definitely felt like Brady’s last game in New England, and it ended on a goddamn pick six.
2009 NFC Championship game.
I'll give you a hint: Patriots game last season. All I need say.
I'd love to be selfish and pick something from the Eagles fans house of repressed trauma.   But lets be real, its 28-3
My team: SB 54. We went from up 20-10 to loosing 20-31 all within the last 7 mins of the game. It was an all around team loss but considering defense did their job against Mahomes for most of the game, Shanny and Jimmy should’ve been jumped as soon as the plane landed in the Bay  Overall: SB 51. Nothing has been more heartbreaking than blowing a 28-3 lead while trying to win ur first SB in franchise history. I would’ve resigned being a Falcons fan at that point
2009 NFCCG is the easy answer, but I think the one that might have pissed me off most outside of that was the 2003 season finale against the Cardinals. I threw an *epic* tantrum and got grounded for two weeks after that game...
28-3
You know god damn well what it is
Bet you I can think of a few  Particularly throughout a certain hall of famers tenure
What exactly was so heartbreaking about SB38? I get most of these other examples regarding the Patriots, but they were better than the Panthers in that game. The only reason why that game was that close was because Vinateri missed 2 FGs from 31 and 36 yards and Brady threw a dumb INT in the red zone. But other than that, the Patriots were moving the ball at will all game long and if you think Brady wouldn’t have been able to lead a GW FG drive in a tie game whether at the 20 yard line or at the 40 yard line (or even more because the Patriots could’ve theoretically returned the kickoff for a TD if we’re playing the hypothetical game) then I’ve got a bridge to sell you.
Definitely 13 seconds, heartbreaking is an understatement.
Cardinals loosing to the Steelers in the Super Bowl. Still makes me sad that Fitzgerald is ringless.
I'll pick something that doesn't involve my own fanbase and one that I haven't seen yet in the comments: SB 34, Rams/Titans, Titans receiver goes down at the 1 yard line on the final play of the game on what would have been the game tying TD/extra point to force overtime.
I remember a playoff game in the mid 80's where the Lions actually had the dynasty 9ers on the ropes, all they needed was a last second fg for the win but they missed it, I still remember seeing the wave of relief wash over Walsh when the ball sailed wide left.
Run it with Frank.  Watching an armless Purdy as the Eagles defense started to figure it out sucked too.
2015 Bengals - finally get a playoff victory, against your biggest rivals on your home turf, the same team that ruined your star QB’s knee 12 years early, 0-5 in the playoffs since that fiasco. All they had to do was run it 3 times and kick a field goal and it’s basically over or not get 30 yards in penalties with under a minute
I am a Falcons fan sooooo……
Bengals losing the Super Bowl. If only Burrow had .2 seconds more Chase was open for the TD. That's an imagine seared into my brain.
Oak@NE divisional playoff game. IT WAS A FUMBLE! 😆
Dez caught it.
2016 versus the Packers. If we would have won that I honestly think we would have won the Super Bowl.
The only correct answer is the Seahawks throwing a int at the 1yd line as time expires in the Super Bowl OR the falcons blowing a 28-3 lead in the Super Bowl
Run the damn ball…
Gotta be Sea vs Pats yeah?!?
The last time I ever cried was the Patriots going 18-1.  Nothing has hurt me as bad since.  (Thank God for being so lucky)
I thought that game was pretty fun 🤷‍♂️
I’m not old enough to remember any real playoff heartache and the like for my Phins. With that said, that game against the Steelers years ago where Big Ben fumbles on the goal line, and it clearly being recovered by the phins, only to have Gene Stero-whatever from Pennsylvania say “no clear evidence of who recovered the ball, therefore it’s Pittsburgh ball on the one yard line” still get my blood boiling
Can't really say it was SEEN, but the Fog Bowl was just awful. There is no way that should have happened, but it did. That defense could have taken us all the way, and our offense was wet dynamite. We could drop 35 on ya and no way anyone scores 4 TD's against us. Jesus Christ. I loved that team. The end of an era.
Superbowl 49
Double doink
Cam not diving for that fumble in the super bowl. Ill never forget that loss. 😞
^(Sad about the titans)  when the titans lost in the sb to the Steelers, 1 more yard and the game would have been tied with a td
Brady’s last game as a Pat was pretty heartbreaking
2019 Divisional vs the Titans  If they played without the BS that happened, I see Lamar getting his ring and none of the contract mess that we have now. It dont matter who the NFC champ was, we would beat them in the SB.
It's one thing to have a heartbreaking loss AND you knew you lost.  It's another thing to see a heartbreaking loss and you know you just got fucked by the league because they wanted a different team in the championship game.  As a Saints fan, the playoff loss to the Vikings when Stephon Diggs burned the Saints in the Minnesota Miracle hurt like hell.  But as a Saints fan, you expect to get burned.  You just expect the team to let you down.  Fast forward...  The "NOLA No Call" was an absolute tragedy and I quit watching the NFL for a long time because that's when it became apparent to me that the NFL (which I spent decades loving) was fixed.  The Rams were in their first year in LA, the biggest market that had been without an NFL team.  The city had spent a shit ton of money on a new stadium.  The NFL desperately wanted a team to succeed there after having several others fail.  BOTH new LA teams happened to make the playoffs but the Chargers had just gotten blown out by the Patriots.  So the NFL had to make sure the other LA team made it to the Superbowl.  And they did.  I was one of many who didn't watch the Superbowl that year and that Superbowl was the lowest rated one in a decade.  It seems a lot of even non-Saints fans didn't watch it.  After the game, in a press conference, referee Vinovich was asked about his blatantly bad call and he actually said he didn't see it.  Vinovich is the ref who called off the l blatantly bad no call.  Then the commissioner went a long time without addressing the game changing call.    Given the NFLs response it became clear that the fix was in for that particular game.
I'll obviously get zero sympathy which I'm ok with, but the perfect season loss to the Giants was a huge bummer. The majority of the team were really likeable, good-spirited guys like Bruschi, Seau, Brown, Faulk, Wilfork, Vrabel, etc.  Definitely had some divas like Moss and Harrison but I'd say all in all it was a great group of dudes who's hard work got wiped and forgotten.
Bucs loss to the Rams after that nutty (scripted) comeback in the NFC Championship for the Bucs to go back to back.
We have had so damn many devastating playoff losses over the last 3 decades. [Probably this one though](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6W2yHgJWQw). Sadly enough, you could argue this for #1 and you could also argue it's not even top 5(Broncos '97, Giants '07, Cardinals '09, Giants '11, Seahawks '14, Bucs '20, 49ers '21)  &nbsp;  The one that's not my team: Cardinals losing in the SB to the Steelers
FUCK MATT DODGE
Immaculate reception. Or maybe the Ice Bowl when Stabler hit Branch on a long pass at the end but he couldn't get out of bounds on the ice.
Super bowl 51 made me literally feel like my team just lost in that superbowl.
47 wide right has to be up there.
Billy Cundiff's missed 32yd field goal, but it all worked out in hindsight.
I have too many that I don’t want to recall them. They still hurt even with the last 5 years I’ve gotten to experience 😂
Bengals v Steelers 2015 Divisional
I don't like this question.
The Comeback. It's almost a tie with the Oilers/Chiefs game (thanks awfully for running off Joe Montana, SF).
Have to be 28-3 and the Wilson pick in the end zone.
Not my team? Two NFC South teams. Panthers in SB38 and Falcons in SB51. Patriots caused a lot of heartbreaks
Super bowl 43 :[
Dez’s no-catch that was absolutely a catch
49ers vs Chiefs in the SB
Norwood wide right; Music City Bullshit; 13 seconds....spin the wheel 🤬
The stupid Blair Walsh field goal with the Seahawks/Vikings. I don’t think I’ve ever gotten over it and field goals scare me.
The Minneapolis Miracle for the Saints is up there. Also because of the Vikings kicked the extra point I would’ve won a 4-leg parlay but they didn’t
1998 NFC Conf. Championship when the Falcons beat the Vikings in relation to Gary Anderson’s missed field goal
Jacoby meyers………..
Vikings loss to the Chiefs.  Superbowl IV
We don’t talk about that game
“Wide right! Wide right! Giants win!”
Recent memory I can remember, OBJ breaking his ankle against the Chargers.   We ended getting punched and I think everyone knows how the rest of that season went..
That Jamal Agnew fumble against the chiefs deflated me so much
13 seconds, wide right, music city miracle.
As a Packers fan... Any NFC Championship game in which we had a chance except against the niners a couple years ago.  &#x200B;  Rodgers should have AT LEAST 3 more super bowl appearances, if not rings, and the casual fan will say it's all his fault but anyone who knows football knows our defenses and special teams lead us to failure almost every time. Dude is one of the most talented to ever play the QB position and our FO wasted it all away except the year the Pack won it when we had a top 10 defense.  &#x200B;  Yes, I can't wait for him to be gone with his drama but I'd be an idiot to not acknowledge all he's done for the franchise and the game of football in general.  If I had to pinpoint one game specifically - probably the one against Seattle which we were dominating Wilson all game. Had that game in the bag and our ST / Def / McCarthy play calling ruined it.
Do I even I have to say it
Super Bowl 54. I just wanted to shoot the TV after
It is too painful to address
RGIII.
Packers fan, pick any playoff loss of the last 10 years. Burns every time
Titans losing to Rams in SB.
The NFCCG.
Tuck rule
The other day I randomly started thinking about the America's Game episode about Superbowl V and how it feels like a Missing Ring episode for Superbowl III. It probably didn't help that SB V was a terrible game, but the ring did not seem to alleviate their pain about losing to the Jets at all.  I thought that it must be a truly devastating loss, when you are still bitter about it despite having won a championship in the end.
1998
For me personally?  2009 NFC Championship.  I’ll never forget it.  Overall?  Super Bowl LI.  Watching a team lose after having a 25 point lead in the Super Bowl was a new level of brutal.
Gary Anderson……………………..
2015 bengals vs Steelers playoff game.
98 NFCCG. Gary Anderson didn’t miss a kick all season. He set up for a FG and I was already dancing thinking the Vikings were going to the Superbowl. Well he missed and the dread that set in still haunts me.
Vikings to Falcons 1998
Honestly the Hail Larry.  All of the other losses felt earned, but that one just felt like one dude putting the team on his back and there wasn’t anything you could do.
I don't think I even have to answer this one
As an Ex-Oilers fan, it’s my responsibility to point out franchise’s penchant for breaking hearts in the playoffs. From the Renfro catch that should’ve been a TD and was the reason for instant replay, to the Glanville Steelers game, to the Drive II to the Comeback, and finally KC Montana… we were so mired in heartbreak it was sown into the very fiber of the franchise and city.   So while Titans fans frolic in the flowers of the Music City Miracle, claiming Oilers history, they will never know true pain.
I mean... Seattle blowimg the SB to NE was pretty sad
As a Vikings Fan of over 55 years pick one for me
Coming back down 35-7 in the fourth quarter against the 14-0 Panthers just to lose on a buzzer beating field goal was some brutal stuff, that comeback was straight magic before it ended
62-7.
Lions loss on an absurd record breaking down to the inch field goal
Super Bowl XLIX 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
Billy Cundiff wide right.
losing to the pats in SB 38
Packers Seahawks 2014 NFCCG.
I still haven’t watched the highlights from the 2014 nfc championship
For me, its a coin flip between the 2014 or the 2020 NFCC games.  I think 2020 might be worse because we forced 4 interceptions on Brady and didn't capitalize on any of them, but I still have PTSD of Bostik messing up on special teams.
1996 Divisional Round.  But it made the next season THAT much sweeter.
For the Chiefs: Dee Ford offsides  Overall: 28-3
1998 Vikings. I was 10 years old at the time. Legit had nightmares after the NFC championship loss. Little did I know that was one of many heartaches to come as a Vikings fan.
My team lost to Tim Tebow in the playoffs and my friends still make fun of me for it. That’s pretty heartbreaking
Probably the dropped pass to Corey Coleman to seal the winless season in 2017
Viking-Seahawks in the 2016 wild card game was pretty crazy... missed 27 yard attempt.   The fact Walsh went to Seattle the next year added to the humor.
Raiders 2021 against the Bengals, such a magic run at the end of an absolute shit show of a season. Only to watch us play a decent game, then have penalties and the phantom whistle lose us the game
Lee Evans/Billy Cundiff crushed me. Made the next year all the more sweet, though
For me, the Vikings championship game was rough. Seeing rg3 falling was rough too
texans chiefs divisional playoff game. 24-0 if we win that game we host the titans in the afc championship at home. we owned the titans that year. it was our best shot at reaching the super bowl. before halftime i was making arrangements to buy tickets to the next game.   not only did we lose but that loss started the downward spiral of the texans that we still have not recovered from. probably the quickest i’ve ever seen a team go from super bowl contender to dumpster fire
One time all Rahim “the ~~dream~~ nightmare” Moore had to do was knock down a pass. Instead he tried to play hero ball.   Then John fox decided to call a kneel down.
Super Bowl 50 was obviously a punch in the gut.  Honorable mention is in 2016 we had it in the bag vs Chiefs and we gift wrapped them all their points in the 4Q. It looked like maybe we were finally getting over the Super Bowl hangover and choked big time. No major implications in the big picture but I remember that game being a tough pill to swallow.
The last one
And I quote "hey diddle diddle ray rice up the middle!"
Should have handed the ball to Marshawn  🥲
In my time as a Vikings fan: Blair Walsh missing the chip shot game winning field goal against the Seahawks in the Wild Card.  Otherwise, the Giants loss hurts only because I felt like this Vikings team *could* beat anyone.  Unfortunately they could also lose to anyone
2008 Cardinals loss to the Steelers. Having Larry take the lead late in heroic fashion only to be tip toed away by Holmes was tragic.
Rodgers bomb on the lions in ford field to end the season :/:/:/
The Bucs and Rams playoff game in 2021. Rams we’re up big only for the Bucs to come back and blow it all sending a heavy blitz with like 30 seconds left and getting burnt deep. Pain
Cody Parkey
Miracle in New Meadowlands..
This years Super Bowl was pretty brutal for me. I grew up an eagles fan but was too young during the first eagles/pats Super Bowl that we lost to really understand what losing a Super Bowl felt like. My only true eagles fan Super Bowl experience was 2017 which was obviously amazing. This years Super Bowl started out feeling like that. Up against the greatest qb in the league, we even started off hot, but we obviously all know how it ended.
I dont like this question
No comment.
Rams vs Patriots 2018 Super Bowl  Mainly heartbreaking cause that's when Todd Gurley started playing worse, and we lost to Tom Brady in the Super Bowl for the second time
Seahawks v NE in the Super Bowl.  Still hurts my lil heart.
Super Bowl 38  Still have nightmares about that kickoff
2014 Boys vs Packers, Romo’s last playoff game. Robbed fans of a great finish to a great game and ended Romo’s last chance.
2015 panthers  Also 2003  Anything panthers.  Or that exciting bills/chiefs game that was insane
Titans losing the Superbowl at the 1 yard line. Still hurts.
As a Seahawks fan, it would have to be the superbowl loss to New England. It was a phenomenal game, and we had a chance of winning,  but everything changed with the infamous interception. So many people were heartbroken over that loss
The AFC Championship game against the Chiefs. That run was magic and I thought we were winning it all.
Yeah…..
Sigh...
Browns-Broncos AFC title game. Byner fumbles on the way into the end zone for the winning score with seconds to play
I’d have to say the Minneapolis Miracle. I’m confident the saints win the sb that year.
I’m from Seattle so the SB still sticks in my brain, but the worst was the 98 Vikings. Atlanta has no business going, that SB . Could you imagine the Vikings vs Packers instead of what we got.
Vikings fan here...  how much time do u have?
Double Doink
For me it will always be "The Fumble".  Browns v Broncos 1987 AFC Championship Game.    I was very young and an enormous Browns fan, I cried for an hour after that game.  Browns to take the lead and go to the Super Bowl, Earnest Byner fumbles the ball at the goal line and we lose by 5.  If you watch the video below, please imagine an 8 year old boy's heart being ripped out of his chest when that ball hits the turf.   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TM7zRs91BgI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TM7zRs91BgI)
Toss up between the 2019 AfC Championship game and the Divisional round the season before last. The first game felt like we decided to take the foot off the gas, after watching the same thing happen to Houston the week prior. The other, one of those games where if 1 of 6-8 plays bounce the other way, you're back in the title game.
Asa Packer fan...4th &26...need I say more?
Super Bowl 34 where the titans lost to the rams on the 1 yard line
Just let me check my note book from the past 5-7 years
The nfccg still turns my stomach any time I think of it
Santonio Holmes and his stupid feet grazing the turf.
Cards-Steelers SB. We were a team of destiny all through the playoffs. Kurt was doing his thing, Larry was playing out of this world. Then freakin James Harrison rumbles the whole length of the field before halftime… we come back later with Fitz scoring the most beautiful TD you’ll ever see.. and then GD Santonio Holmes does his thing. And that was that.
Bengals vs Steelers 2015 WC. 10 year old me was depressed for days
Romo in NFC championship game
2018 NFCCG or Minneapolis Miracle the year prior.
*sighs*  ‘15 WC. That game was literally in our fucking hands.
How has nobody said Santonio Holmes?
The Super Bowl
Double doink 😭
Something about some kind of miracle. Idk, I don't want to talk about it.
When the Njners lost against the Seahawks back in 2014.  Watching Bowman tear his ACL and MCL then getting popcorn dumped on him as he’s carted off *then* losing the game absolutely hurt me.
FUCK YOU CODY PARKEY....  And Go Bears....
No thank you.  Also, Falcons.
2017 Jags Divisional.  End of an era.
2021 Divisional Round
That Super Bowl in 2023 kinda stung.
Super Bowl LVI. Frick Eli Apple.
How much time do you have?
batted ball out of the endzone, pass interference flag picked up, hail mary, 41-10 beatdown by washington... so many to choose from
Titans to Rams. Super Bowl 34.
Tim "MF'ing" Tebow being himself against my Steelers.
55-10...if you know, you know
The “no call” in the nfc championship for sure
More than one.    &#x200B;  Vikings losing to Atlanta in the NFC championship, and Vikings losing to the Cowboys in the NFC championship.
2021 Divisional Round vs the Rams. Come back from 27-3 down only to lose on a bomb to Kupp. Honestly could have went back to the Super Bowl that year
Kurt Warner’s last game was super depressing, especially considering the high of the week prior.
Probably the playoff loss to the Cowboys. It is a very rare occasion that a Lions fan has something to get excited about and that team was loaded that year with Stafford, Bush, Megatron, Suh etc. They finally had a team build to make a run. They have the game in control. Cowboys clearly commit a defensive pass interference, a flag gets thrown and the ref gets on the mic and announces the pass interference and it looks like the Lions are in position to win the game  Then, something I've never seen before, all of a sudden they just decide "nevermind" and they overturn the correct call without a single explanation given or any kind of announcement. Next play, the Lions shank a punt and the Cowboys come down and score and the Lions still sit at only 1 playoff win in their franchise history. Then Dean Blandino, the VP of officiating, is caught partying on the Cowboys bus that same night after they won just to rub the whole thing in.  The only thing that made me feel better was seeing the Cowboys get completely screwed the next week. Unfortunately that was against the Packers though haha. But then the Packers got their heart broken the next week in a game they should have won. It was a weird postseason. If they Lions weren't so putrid historically, I'm sure one bad call in a playoff game wouldn't be this high on the list but there aren't many high stakes games to point to.  Honorable mention goes to the Rodgers Hail Mary after the blown facemask call and Caldwell being clueless as to how to guard a hail Mary.
Wide right 😞
I’m a Lions fan but I lived in North Carolina when Jake Delhomme and the Panthers lost the Superbowl on the final drive to a young Tom Brady. The whole state was pretty invested in the Cardiac Cats and even as a visitor, that one hurt.
No mention of Wide Right?
I’m a Seahawk fan.
Tuck make me sad
David Akers missing 2 field goals allowing Rodgers his only SB. This happened the same year we had Vick starting and I had multiple teachers that were pscker fans. Insufferable, skipped those classes for a few days. To be a young fan again. Now as an adult I know follow the money of contracts (outside of Mahones) your team will suck if not properly balanced on the pay scale.
Vikings loss in 1998 NFC Championship. Taking a knee at halftime when you have Randy Moss, Gary Anderson misses game winning field goal after being perfect for the entire year
My dad's a Saints fan
Giants beating the Bills in the Super Bowl. I wasn't a fan of either team, but I thought the Bills outplayed them.   Second place, Bills over Oilers...a few years later though, I was officially sick of the Bills.
Giants loss in San Fran when they blew that 20+ point lead
Probably when the Lions lost to the Ravens because of Tuckers record breaking field gold that bounced over. Absolutely insane to watch that happen live, and ik it wasn’t a huge game but still losing like that is wild.
There was no NFC championship in 2014 in my mind.
MJWD is the easy choice for my own team
The Bears double doink.. had me rippin my shirt off and shit. Smh
Lee Evans dropping the winning touchdown immediately followed by Cundiff missing a tying 32-yard field goal in the AFC Championship in New England is maybe the fastest I’ve gone from elated to deflated in my life. We HAD it.
2018 Saints Rams NFC Championship Game  I’ve always been a fan of Drew Brees but no so much the Saints. To watch a chance at Brees vs Brady in an epic duel was squandered on a terrible missed call. (Yes I know Brees threw a pick in OT) Instead of Brees vs. Brady, we got… 13-3, one of the most boring Super Bowls ever.
The 2012 season WC game where RG3 tore his ACL. He was dinged going into the game so idk how far they realistically could’ve gone that year, but losing the game and then seeing our franchise player who finally had reenergized the fanbase and provided real hope go down in such an awful way was just brutal.  Our watch party felt like a funeral that night. I always was salty watching the Seahawks the couple years after that too because it felt like they were living the trajectory I was hoping for. Both teams were young and ascending (caveat that their defense was obviously much better) with an exciting QB and really good running game. They went on to back to back SBs the following 2 years, while we won 7 games total and RG3 was never the same. The whole thing was just a kick in the balls.
Double doink
4 straight losses in the SB, seems pretty bad.  I would be emotional as a Bills fan. They do have a great team now though.
49ers last season having 4 qb injuries in 1 season, with 2 of them being in the NFC champ game…
Yeah I can’t think of one
Don’t get me started
Losing to the colts in the field goal bowl
End my misery
I know what it is, but I don't wanna say it.
Not a Chargers fan, but my god, their losses are awful.
Don’t mind me I’m over here still bitter about the 1990 NFCCG and Montana being hurt. Roger Craig fumbling…
When the Browns lost to the Chiefs in 2020 season playoffs was pretty crappy. The helmet to helmet no call was just a gross way to lose coupled with the fact that the defense couldn’t stop the Chiefs backup QB at the end.
2015 Bengals vs Steelers Playoffs
Saints Rams playoff sham
:(
Gotta think the niners losing their 3rd and 4th string qb in the conference finals was pretty hard to watch.
Most recently, the first patriots game. Just watching how hopeless our offense was without Breece and watching Zach play terrible was just deflating. Another candidate is the 2nd patriots game.
Uhhh…
100% the Falcons SB loss. Biggest choke job with your franchises first SB on the line. Imagine celebrating all night like it’s the greatest moment ever then watching it all slowly unravel. This past SB hurt, but I can’t even fathom what it would be like to be a Falcons fan at that time.
Fail Mary full of grace, the refs are with thee...  Then two years later the 2014 NFC Championship up 19-7 with 2 minutes left.  I will never not hate the Seahawks.
The Packers have had several bad playoff losses (Giants in overtime, Seahawks with the onsides kick, Atlanta with Vick, and every game against the 49ers) but the one that sticks in my mind is the 4th and 26 against the Eagles. The Packers defense just let Mitchell run down the middle of the field and catch the ball. It was crazy.
Just one?
24-0
Hmmmm…Where should we start?
Something about an insane multi-lateral play followed by a missed PAT.
28-3
Music City Miracle. 😔
Vikings vs Seahawks in the playoffs when it was ridiculously cold. 20 some yard kick to win it, and he shanks it. I swear it got 10 degrees colder after that. Never felt so cursed. (98 championship was brutal too).
“Intercepted at the goal line by Malcolm Butler!”
I can’t remember the year I think maybe 1987 or something. NY giants vs the rams playoff game. Good game back and forth.   Goes to overtime and willie “flipper” Anderson catches a touchdown pass and just keeps running right into the tunnel and into the locker room.   For some reason the loss plus he just left and didn’t celebrate at all just broke me.   We have had season tickets forever and I’ve never seen my father like the way he was. He just sat in our seats section 119 row 12 for like 1/2 hour. Finally I was like “hey dad you re ready to go” and he is like “yea sure”.
Whale……
Where do I start?
Saints fan. Not ready to talk about it
Super Bowl 50 made me fucking sick.
2014 NFCCG - Packers at Seahawks
As a life long Chiefs fan basically any playoff appearance before mahommes. Colts and Titans stand out.
There was some ravens-jaguars game a few years ago that the ravens had won, as the clock expired on a final snap, so no one on the line moved. Except for our linebacker who tackled the qb for no reason, and grabbed his face mask. After the game was over  So they got one more play, moved up 15 yards, kicked a FG and we lost. Not as notable as the Super Bowl, still the worst loss I’ve seen
Browns vs. Jets last year on my birthday, I was there in attendance and watched my team absolutely BLOW it
I’m a Seahawks fan, nuff said
Greatest game of all time… Falcons v Patriots
99-present
I'm only 22, so 13 seconds
Every given Sunday
Even though I am not a fan of the Titans, them coming up one yard short in  the super bowl still stings 20+ years later.
As a Steelers fan I would say the loss to Tebow in the playoffs. I was convinced we would win it all that year and every time I see that play I die inside. Its almost as bad as the Steelers super bowl loss to the packers
Romo botched snap
2009 NFC championship game. All Brett Favre had to do was throw the ball away or fall down and Ryan Longwell sends us to the Super Bowl
Double Doink live hurt me in ways I still feel….
Might be recency bias but packers lions week 18 was a toughie
We all know the answer.
I’m a Seahawks fan. We all know the answer here. Pats Hawks SB
Being a Green Bay Packers fan, the 2014 NFC championship against Seattle was a huge heartbreaker.
The broncos/colts game this year almost ruined my Hawaiian vacation…
Packers loss to Seattle in 2014 NFCCG
Easy
Billy cundiff
Uhhh… IDK
As a bills fan would you like them alphabetically or chronologically
As a Seahawks fan...this is an easy and heartbreaking answer...why we didn't run it in with Marshawn on our team will haunt us forever! The win was ours. 💚💙💚
Super Bowl LlV.  To concede 21 points in the 4th quarter. Ah man. Still hurt about it.
Everyone is gonna say 28-3 but that was a long slow burn to the end. Watching the Seahawks push down the field for the game winning walk off TD in their second straight Super Bowl with 26 seconds left on the clock from the 2 yard line only to be intercepted in the end zone was the most gut wrenching thing I’ve ever witnessed and experienced.   Hopes and dreams at an all time high and an all time low within seconds.
Green Bay. 2008. Giants. NFC Championship. Lambeau. To be fair we probably couldn’t have beaten NE and I was so happy NY did, but man that one still hurts. Honorable mention Eagles 4th and 26.
Miracle in the Meadowlands II ranks up there.   2002 NFC Wild Card, NYG vs SF. I was at a holiday party I didn’t want to be at, so I kept escaping to the bar to check the score. I figured we were safe at halftime being up by 24 points. Checked in again, only to see SF had scored 25 points, and the Giants were attempting a last second field goal. They botched the snap, and in the desperation pass attempt they were flagged for ineligible man downfield, even though there was obvious DPI on an eligible lineman.
I was at the Blair Walsh playoff game.
Rams Patriots SB. So much hype from the season to roll into a large helping of humble pie
Bears most recent playoff game 😭 the double doink 😔
Gary Anderson 1998 missing the only kick of the year
Ray Finkle’s missed game winning field goal in the Super Bowl #lacesout
2017 Steelers vs. Patriots! Honestly, if Sean Davis would've caught that interception before the Patriots scored, the Steelers win 24-19, instead of losing 27-24. And the Jesse James Catch would never happen and the Steelers would've been 14-2!
2(doink) = sad
Probably won't be a popular one but the Pats losing the big game to the Giants after going undefeated the rest of the season
For me 49ers losing the Giants in 1990 when Roger Craig fumbled as they were putting the game away. It ended what would have been a historic three-peat.
Cody Parky’s double drink-Bears vs Eagles in the 2019 playoffs
I’m a Seahawks fan so I clearly can’t think of any heartbreaking/franchise altering lose in the most important game of any football season. No sir.
I was cheering for Kurt Warner but Tennessee coming up 1/2 a yard short in 2000 as time expired has to be up there with 28-3.
Double Doink.    Actually bears super bowl loss in 06 season
No, just no
Romo, playoffs, missed the hold for the chip shot field goal to beat the Seahawks. I will never get over that
2007 SB. I cried. Too young for the first 3 dynasty ones so this hurt like a bitch
I think most fans were more optimistic than me about the future after our SB loss. We play in a conference where you’ll need to beat two of Mahomes, TLaw, Herbert, Allen, Lamar and possibly ARod to even make the SB. Our division is also incredibly tough and usually has 3 if 4 teams competitive in a given year. Even in great years that’s a tall order and our roster is about to have to get very creative due to massive contracts coming. That SB loss was crushing
As a bears van.. double doink shattered my world.
SB XXXVI because it blocked our dynasty in way of another. The 2001 team would've gone down as one of the best of all time. Obviously the offense was loaded, but I believe we were top 5 in defense too. If we won, Martz probably doesn't push Warner so hard he breaks and he's able to have more great seasons with the GSOT
2008 super bowl loss to the steelers. that was the day i learned why sports are important to people.
Rasherd mendenhall fumbling away the comeback effort in Super Bowl 45 is the worst
I feel like in that Texans game the coaches only allowed Connor Cook to scan half the field. There were numerous receivers running wide open multiple times during that game and Cook didn't even look at em. The Texans seemed like they knew too because they just simply didn't cover them.
For me it was the Vikings loss to the Falcons in 1999
Not a panthers fan but Super Bowl 50 was a tragic end to a magical season
Double doink
I know no one has sympathy for the Packers, but the last few post seasons endings sucked. Seeing all of that potential and seeing the Rodgers era end with only one Super Bowl was pretty heartbreaking
I mean, where do we start?
Unbiased me says it has to be the Falcons. But they kinda deserved it because the second half gameplay was awful.
The dez catch playoff game still haunts my dreams. Having refs dictate a ending just does something to a person
As a Chargers fan…27-0
The Saints divisional round for me in 2018-2019 I really thought the birds would repeat. This years Super Bowl was tough too but at least they played in the Super Bowl.
So joey Porter...
Mcnabb falling apart in the superbowl
1998 NFC Championship game. I was 14 and the entire state was convinced we were going to the Super Bowl. Losing in OT destroyed me.
Cardinals Steelers SB.  that’s all
I understand Raiders fans who can’t get over 2001. It was a fumble. They got boned by a terrible rule that no longer exists because of how terrible it was.   Charles Woodson has the right to wake up angry every damn day.
One freaking yard
2000 Super Bowl… I still swear he was going to make it. It was so close.
Double doink
Two words: Trey Junkin.
You said my most heartbreaking loss. I think they would have beaten the Texans with Carr for sure.
It's gotta be the Titans' Super Bowl. 1 yard away from glory.
Giving up two TD's in the final two minutes against the Jets in week 2 of the 2022 season.  I was not alive for Red Right 88, the Drive, or the Fumble, but that game ripped my heart out and killed any remaining love for the Browns I had that trading for DeShaun Watson had not already removed.
Feels insignificant now, but intercepting Tom Brady to win the AFC championship game in Mahomes first year, only to be called back on a dee ford offsides call. That was soul killing when we’d never been that close in my life time
Dez caught it man, that was the best team we had in a long time
Did the Bills lose? That is it.   Honestly, I think all losses, especially playoff losses, are a special kind of awful.
the Titans coming up 1 yard short in the Super Bowl
I... I don't want to play this game.   Though the one I was watching where the announcer best showed heart break was the New Orleans v. JACKSONVILLE multiple lateral game. 2001, 2002 is. The Saints needed the win to stay alive in the playoffs. They scored on the only desperation, multi lateral play I've ever seen. Then Carney one of the most accurate kickers ever shanks the extra point, losing by one. The scream of anguish that came was the most raw, primal thing ever.
13 seconds…
December 21st, 2003 - Saints needed to win to make the playoffs. Scored a TD of some crazy play against the Jags. All they needed was a FD to win....shank the FG and the Jags celebrated
27-0 😭
That loss to the Pats in the SB by the Panthers still pisses me off.   They were so close.   The loss to Denver in the SB was a thrashing.  It sucked but it was never a close game, Panthers were clearly outmatched by that D vs our OLine.     The Pats SB was different
I’m a Bears fan…so….
Titans losing to the Bengals two years ago. I had a bad feeling from the start. Our squad was stacked!
As a Steelers fan who has been around the block a time or two, I’ve had plenty of heartbreaking losses. Fortunately, I’ve also been on the other side of that spectrum plenty of times.   I think when you are around long enough, you realize that the ball is probably going to bounce your way sometimes and other times it won’t.   If you have a well run organization, you’re probably going to be on the right side a little more often than not; and if you have a poorly run organization, you’re probably going to be on the wrong side a little more often than not.   For me, the worst one was probably the Raiders in ‘76. I sincerely believe that Steelers team was the best team in history of the NFL, but they are not regarded as such because they did not win the Super Bowl. They do not win the Super Bowl because everyone was hurt.   That’s how it goes. But it still stinks.  That was definitely the best team in the Steelers have ever had.    There were others too. Losing the Dallas in Super Bowl XXX was crushing because we had their asses but threw two absolutely boneheaded interceptions that directly cost us the game.    Again though, that’s football  I’m sure they feel similarly about Super Bowls X or XIII.
I mean, objectify (in my 28 years in this earth), the 28-3 falcon’s SB loss is easily the most heartbreaking. I didn’t go to class for 2 days and I’m not even apart of the team.
How much time ya got buddy
Well, a certain game made me reevaluate where football was as a priority for me lol. Took a few Xanax and drank like 3 4Lokos and passed out for a few days. Lost my job and everything. Had to do some soul searching after that one lol
The Eagles Superbowl loss to the Patriots.
As a packer fan…. 2014 NFCCG @ SEA
I hate y’all so much
Double doink
Ravens fan. Billy cundiff Lee evans no question
 2018 AFCC ... Dee Ford called for lining up offside.
I don’t like this question.
Wide. Right.
Cody. Parkey.
Megatron’s negated catch in the end zone at Soldier Field. Makes you wonder if that teams fortunes would have changed with a big win.
The 2011 AFC Championship Game. The Billy Cundiff missed field goal that cost the Ravens a trip to the Super Bowl.
To me it’s still Super Bowl 25.   The fortune of the Bills never recovered
Jesse James caught the damn ball!
All my homies hate Mike Jones
You're asking me to pick...one?
It'd have to say the No Call with the Minneapolis Miracle close behind.
Packers Seahawks playoff game
Not a loss, but the game when Carr broke his leg in the 2016 season.  "IT'S BROKE! IT'S BROKE! IT'S BROKE! IT'S BROKE! IT'S BROKE!"  In the NFL film you can hear one of the lineman drop an fbomb in frustration.  [Glad they cut the audio of him screaming in pain](https://youtu.be/p-UjeOmBUro?t=204)
I mean notmatter who you are a fan of, I think we can all admit 28-3 is the worst loss in sports history   &#x200B;  lucky me, I’m a Brady fan
I’ve never been as upset over a football game as when the Seahawks beat us 19-3 on Thanksgiving in 2014.  It wasn’t just the game or the season, it was clear that Harbaugh was going and that everything on the team would be torn down and rebuilt.  Which is exactly what happened.
Barry Sanders retirement
Objectively, it’s gotta be Anderson missing that kick for the Vikings after being perfect for the entire ‘98 season. Add to the fact that they’ve never won a Super Bowl and that was one of the best teams they’ve ever put together, that’s truly heartbreaking
Seahawks
I mean I paid $1600 to watch the Double Doink in person soo
Either Billy Cundiff or 28-7
XXXIV
You already know. Getting cheesed out by refs is one thing, not giving it to the man, is another that hurts so much more.
Jesse James caught it
DEZ BRYANT FUCKING CAUGHT IT
the loss of RGIII’s acl
YEAH PATRIOTS FANS - WHAT WAS IT?
Travis Kelces opening day pitch at the Guardians opener!
How could you possibly expect us to pick just one?
2007 super bowl, Asante Samuel was so fucking close to achieving what would’ve been perfection :(
Jeff Saturday colts vs Vikings
2014 NFCCG made me stop being so invested in my teams success. Nothing else I’ve ever watched as a packers fan will hurt as bad as that. Even if it’s a 28-3, I just won’t care as much as I did back then.
Steelers-pats I think Christmas or Christmas Eve. Called back a Jesse James td that was obviously a catch. Literally starting to feel some type of way just thinking about it :(
Super Bowl XL. I’m really not usually one to blame the refs, but that was horrendous over and over again. The “low block” call on Hassellbeck was cherry on top of shit shit sundae of bad calls all day. Could the Seahawks have played better, especially late in the game? Of course. but I understand how easy it is to become dejected when you feel you are being treated unfairly. At least in Super Bowl  XLIX we can blame ourselves. We know we should have run the ball. I have no idea how we were supposed to beat the Steelers and the Refs in XL though.
Bears vs eagles
Diggs. Sideline. Touchdown.
For the Chiefs there are quite a few, but the one that stings the most is still 1995. Chiefs were 13-3, #1 seed, had a lights out defense, but no offense and Steve Bono couldn't help them score more than 7 points and The Kicker Who Shall Not Be Named missed 3 FGs as they lost to the freaking Colts 10-7.
As a saints fan.. do I even have to say it? There's a certain safety who's in Baltimore now who's responsible for my trauma.
Billy Cundiff.
49ers last year. NFC championship game with one of the most entertaining offenses and they dont even get a chance to compete due to a QB injury
not even a saints fan but when they lost the NFC Championship after the worst missed PI i’ve ever seen i was filled with such rage
As a Broncos fan, 2012 Divisional playoffs versus the Ravens… Game was over 4 hours long
The NOLA no-call.. We still should’ve/could’ve won because of this or that yea yea yea, but dang. That one stung a bit.
Chiefs-Falcons Eric Berry pick 2
As a Giants fan, I can't even bring myself to type his name...
Jags losses only, I’d have to say that most recent playoff game against the Pats. You cannot tell me Myles Jack was down. I know the coaching screwed us in that game the second half, but that call certainly changes so much about the remaining part of that game.
One of them was RG3 blowing his knee out in the Wild Card round in 2012, solidifying the Redskins' 3rd straight loss in the playoffs to the Seahawks. Which was also the last 3 playoff games they had played back then.
1998 NFC championship game. Such a heartbreaking loss for us Viking fans.
Doink doink
28-3. Enough said
Montana to Taylor killed my 9 year old soul.
Any of the loses with the manning colts, every team they lost to was worse than the colts, but the worst loss was in 2005 against the Steelers.
13 Seconds for sure.  The Bills should not have lost that game.
The Colts Super Bowl vs. the Saints. That was a kick to the dick but saw it coming.
For me, it was a loss I didn’t even really get to see. Playoff game against the Patriots in January 2015 (‘14 season).  Gary Kubiak lit an absolute fire under our offense’s ass that season, and it really did look like we might actually get back to the SuperBowl again. I had a gig in DC that until about 10pm that night, so I prepped everything in advance: got some beers in the mini fridge upstairs, had a frozen pizza ready.   Showed up at my gig and told the 50+ people there not to mention anything about the Ravens game to me, “so help me god.” Managed to get through the whole gig without hearing a peep, and then worked my way through a crowd of 100-some people afterwards, without hearing a peep. Airplane mode the entire way home, no radio.   Finally got home…my roommates had a bunch of friends over drinking, but they knew I’d be coming home to watch the game, so they were hanging out in the basement to give me some space (cool roommates).   I made it up to the top floor, sat down on the couch, and fired up the game. The first 10 minutes or so were already exhilarating. And then….  One of my roommates’ (very drunk) friends managed to stumble her way up the two flight of stairs, and into the room I was in. She paused, looked at me, and said, “why are you watching the game that we lost??”  It was a double-punch combination of learning that we lost the game, and also having that whole game experience just vanish. A goddamn shame, too, because hot damn that was an exciting game until the very end.  &nbsp;  On a darker — but ultimately lucky — note: I kept my cool about it, but clearly she could tell that I was suppressing some inner rage, because she ended up sneaking out of the house that night and driving home because she felt guilty. She lived 30 minutes away, and was in NO shape to drive (hell, she was barely in any shape to walk). For 30 terrifying minutes, I forgot a game had even occurred, because we were all so damn worried about her. Best phone call ever when she finally called us to say she made it home safe.  (And from that point on, her keys went straight into our hands any time she came over, because fuck that)
Seahawks fan. The easy answer is Super Bowl 49 - Malcolm Butler.  But my *first* heartbreak was "we want the ball and we're gonna score" Seahawks / Packers in like '04.
This isn’t even a questions… Saints v Rams NFC Championship.  We had it, and got skull fucked by the refs.  It still hurts today
Surprised no one mentioned the Saints game where they scored a crazy TD on the last play only to miss the extra point (when it was still from the 2 yard line) and get eliminated from playoff contention.
‘98 Vikings - Wide Left
Saints to a team because of a botched PI call
Week 13, 2015 / Miracle in Motown                           Lions Vs Packers, face mask as time expired Rodgers throws Hail Mary TD with 0’s on the clock
As a Browns fan… the Browns loss to the Chiefs in 2021. Second round of the playoffs. Chad FUCKING Henne. Baker blew it. And the Daniel Sorensen hit on Hollywood Higgins was a no targeting.  Second close would be Mahomes coming back on Watson and the Texans when they were down like 24-0. I lost a lot of money.
For my Ravens- 2011 championship missed kick and Lee Evan’s drop definitely the most heartbreaking. A close second- 08/09 Flacco’s rookie year, loosing the championship to the fuckin Steelers, courtesy as Troy Polamalu and his gorgeous hair getting a pick six on Flacco late in the fourth. Then I think it was Ryan Clark knocked Willis Mcgehee the fuck out. Young me cried so hard
I don't wanna talk about it.
Double doink
Jimmy G overthrow in Super Bowl. Stuff nightmares are made of.
Double doink
1998 Vikings NFC championship game.  Also after Sean Taylor’s death, the Bills/Commies game.
Steelers fan here checking in.  We got Tebowed in a playoff game, OT.  Thanks
2011, in some ways it was almost worse than 2007 because it felt like a storybook redemption was on the table, it was like both Giants losses happening at once
Which one?  We’ve had a few.
I'm a Seahawks fan, guess
Panthers, SuperBowl 50.
Double doink
The Bills losing their 4th Super Bowl. In a row.
Feb 12, 2023...  If that's too fresh to count, just pick one of the 3 consecutive NFCCG losses.
I can't imagine any loss being bigger than the Falcons being up 28-3 in the Superbowl.
Let’s see…’98 Vikings loss to the Falcons, or ‘00 Vikings loss to the Giants, or ‘09 Vikings loss to the Saints, or ‘17 loss to the Eagles or…but if I had to rank them on a pain scale it goes 1) ‘09; 2) ‘98; 3) ‘17; 4) ‘00
As a Raider fan, people talk about the tuck rule, but I remember being so let down when Gruden beat his old Raiders in the Super Bowl. As a kid, I thought that Raider team was invincible.
lmao fuck you op
I know I shouldn’t be speaking, but me and my dad were at the Miami Miracle game, and we were walking out when it happened  We didn’t find out about it until 3 hours after we left miami
As a 49er fan, Losing the SB to the ravens in 2012 or more recently last years NFCC loss against the eagles. Just because how that game played out…. Didn’t even get a chance to play really.
Giants/49ers 2002 for me.  Still annoyed!
Chiefs up 38-10 and lose to colts in playoffs
XLII…. Devastating.
Any Packers playoff loss in the last 9 years.
I’m a Bears fan…youtube “Bears double doink”
Did u see them get blown out in the superbowl? Still healing from that brother
Who Dey think got a more heartbreaking loss?
I’m a falcons fan. Guess.
Dee Ford lining up off sides…
2014 nfc championship. Don’t think I’ll ever get over that one
If Jeremy Hill doesn't fumble vs the steelers in the playoffs. The after effects of that play were insane.
Well, not a game, but 4. All 4 Bills SB runs.   But for singular game? GB vs. Seattle, NFC Championship onside-kick mishap. That stung so badly.
Vikings Falcons NFCCG
Rams v Saints 2019 NFC championship no-call interference.
94 NFC championship game, and the 2007 divisional loss to the Giants being a close second
Every Packers playoff loss in the Rodgers era. Too many to pick from. The Steve Young to T.O. touchdown is seared into my brain
2015 the penalty then the fumble fucking hell!!
I’ve changed “heartbreak “ with absolute terrible coaching. Sure keep calling pass plays with plenty of clock
Bengals-Steelers 2015 Wild Card game 😭
Double…doi… I can’t even. Our defense that year. We had the magic.
This last season’s Browns-Jets game wasn’t the most heartbreaking for me but it was certainly the most anger inducing for me in awhile.
The loss that hurt me was Lions at Philly, 94/95. It was completely over in the 2nd quarter, ended up like 59-31 but our 4 tds came in garbage time. Total humiliation.
Orlando Brown getting hit in the eye with a flag
Idk about THE most heart breaking loss because your team's loss is always the most heartbreaking. But the 49ers losing in the NFC championship because they ran out of QBs feels kinda heartbreaking
2014 NFCCG - onside kick 2019 NFCCG - Raheem Mostert 2020 NFCCG - Kevin King  I am sensing a pattern here.
I dont even think i need to say mine.
Dez caught it
When Kane dished it in the side to beat Philadelphia in OT.  That was great.
Our last 2 super bowls
Was at the MNF Ravens at Browns - tied up with only enough time remaking for a Browns FG attempt. Thought there were two options: 1) Browns win. 2) Tie.   Wrong.   Edit: I feel like playoffs versus the Chiefs, with the blatant targeting no-call and Chad ‘Dreamcrusher’ Henne doing his thing, should be tops - but I was living on Cloud 9 just to see the playoff win (bonus versus the Steelers).
Cody Parkey double doink
Ours in the Moment is probably the 2011 AFC championship game. Lost to the Pats because Lee Evans dropped a game winning TD catch, closely followed by Billy Cundiff, a probowl kicker that year I think, missed a fairly easy game tying field goal as time ran out that would have sent us into overtime.  But looking back, that "Heartbreaking loss"  was actually a blessing in disguise. Because of that loss, we cut Cundiff, signed some unknown free agent rookie named Justin Tucker to replace him. *If* we went on to win the AFCCG in OT and *If* we went on to win the Superbowl, Ray Lewis def would have retired. And we definitely wouldn't have won the Superbowl in 2011 without Ray's Festivus Maximus leadership. And we Definitely wouldn't have God's Boot as our kicker to this day. Same number of rings (1) + GOAT K
Jesse James caught it.
2002-03 NFC championship. Tampa Bay at Philly. Last game at the vet. I don’t think anyone there expected us to lose
This is a tough one
As a Texans fan who bet loads on this game, it amuses me that you thought raiders had a chance.
The Fumble game was pretty rough
Packers playoffs 😪
2013 “mile high miracle”… got damn it Raheem Moore!!
Watching Alex Smith give his all while our best players all got hurt. Offense and defense. He rocked it then Andrew Luck went all out and scored the TD himself. It's one of the best games I've ever watched.
Any packers playoff loss
Doink. Doink.
Double doink is burnt into my brain
When they didn't give in to Marshawn at the goal line...
Hey, grass isn't greener. 2019-2020 playoffs
Chiefs vs Colts like 2013?
Tim fucking Tebow
Vikings fan. There’s too many to count. I think 09 NFC broke me though.   Niners are my number 2 team. Some rough ones the past decade too
SB 42
I will never get over the what could’ve been an undefeated season for the Patriots. 18-1 is a giant kick in the balls. I would gladly give a Super Bowl or 2 just for the Patriots to go 19-0 that year.
Not sure if the Steelers actually “lost the game” but when Ryan Shazier was hurt that was PAINFUL
Cundiff.  Nuff said
punting to desean jackson
The “Fail Mary” Packers v Seahawks loss. The replacement refs sucked the life out of me and Golden Tate when from a decent ND player in the NFL to my least favorite player, and Pete Carroll as the bane of my existence.
Panthers v Patriots Super Bowl
Immaculate reception Raiders v. Steelers
Dez caught it 😭
I’ve been a Broncos fan for almost 40 years…I am starting to lose count: SB XXIV- I think it’s still the biggest Super Bowl ass whooping.  ‘97 loss in playoffs to the Jags- that felt like there year and felt like it would have been the first of a historic “three-peat”.  SBXLVIII- just an embarrassing performance from what was the leagues best ever offense…up to that point.  Every season since SB50- no lie
The one from 2 months ago...   After that I think the Eagles-Saints 2019 game where Alshon didn't catch it. If we won that game I have no questions Files would've won a second ring with the eagles
I’m a Lions fan, where do you want me to start
I only got into football recently, but either our loss to the bengals week 4 or our loss in Buffalo in the wild card both this season
I don’t really have one but my father’s was losing the 1999 NFC title game vs the Rams
The mile high miracle I’ll never ever and i mean ever forgive rahim moote
As a Vikings fan - how much time you got?
Double fucking doink
2012 Playoffs Seattle and Washington. RG3 was unstoppable that season and IiIRC they were up 10-0 when we all saw Robert crumble to the turf. For a fan of a team since the 80s it was the first time in decades that real excitement had returned and just as quickly as it came it was taken away. Seattle ended up winning it all that year and Washington was left wondering what if
05-06 colts v steelers
Myles Jack wasn’t down.
Rodgers to Cobb. The double doink. Rodgers coming back in the 2nd half to ruin Mack’s debut.
Bizarre slant pass… my heart broke.
1987-88 NFC divisional game with the Bears and Redskins. Walter Paytons last game and last game at Soldier Field. McMahon was finally healthy and we ran out to a 14-0 lead in the first half and then just gave it away. Interception after interception by McMahon then a special teams fiasco led to a Daryl Green punt return TD that sealed it. The 49ers had just gotten knocked off by the Vikings so we wouldnt have to see them in the NFC championship and we had destroyed the Vikings at home that year. On top of that we lost a Monday nighter to Denver in Denver with a 4th quarter collapse. Just heartbreaking to see Payton go out with a decent game (18 carries for 85 yards, 3 rec for 20 yards) against a good Redskins front 7.  ETA—finally had a healthy McMahon after having to start Fuller in the 84 NFC Championship game and Flutie in the 86 Divisional and then he goes and throws 3 fuckin picks
As a diehard Pats fan, I'll never get over losing to the Eagles.   Bill benched our best corner and we got TORCHED  WHY BILL WHY! 🥲
1998 NFC Championship game.
The year RG3 killed his knee against Seattle. Such a great year and so much career promise completely destroyed in one game.
Watching Jake Delhomme collapse and turn the ball over 7 times in a playoff game against the cardinals hurt my heart pretty badly.
Jets / Broncos 98 AFC Champ game.
When Gruden beat us in the Superbowl. I never paid that 10 dollar bet to this day.
So so so many (Vikings fan) but 98 15-1 vikes hasn't missed a kick all year.
I watched the heartbreak happen to the Bills with the Music City Miracle only to have my own heartbreak as Kevin Dyson came up half a yard short as time expired in the Superbowl.
I’m a Packers fan…  Idk, just pick one. 😭
Falcons fan here. Fuck yall
Pats beating the Seahawks in SB, on that goal line interception... I swore I would never ever watch any game featuring the Pats of Belichick- Brady, unless they're clearly losing ( like when they lost to the Titans ) So, the Falcons SB and the Rams SB proved me right
I think being a Texans fan is more heartbreaking than any single team most heartbreaking loss.
18-1
The fumble against the raiders that started Brady’s Super Bowl run it was a fumble
Saints fan calling in… you already know. Pick your favorite from the past 15 years.
Double doink
Mariota to Mariota.
As a Dolphins fan? I guess the Wild Card game earlier this year? It was there to be had. Another one is the finale against the Jets in 2013. Just had to beat them to get into the playoffs, and laid an egg. What was even more annoying is Miami was 4-1 against the AFC Playoff teams that year.  As an objective fan? The Falcons Super Bowl. Got a lot of Falcons friends and was pulling hard for them in that game. Plus, that team was just so damn fun to watch. Until they weren’t.
Yeah, that seemed like our year. After so much futility since 2002. Ugh.  Then the next season started out great.  The Trump crap divided the team in week 3 of 2017 and that whole roster needed to be rebuilt after that. We had just gotten Marshawn that offseason  and were rolling after weeks 1 and 2. Fucking Trump.
Chargers moving out of San Diego to LA, where they don’t give a crap about them. That day I realized that being a “true fan” or a “die hard” is a bunch of BS. American sports are about money and only money.
Wide right. End of thread
Wildcard
Double doink. Don’t reply.
As a Bucs fan, 2021 Divisional vs the Rams will forever hurt. Coming back from down 27-3 all the way to tie it, just for us to have Matt Gay win it from 30 yards kills me. That Bucs teams would’ve waltzed passed that 9ers and Bengals team. Fuck if AB doesn’t just go AWOL we never even fall behind 27-3. Ugh kills me to think about. Cooper Kupp still haunts me.   The MNF game with the Colts also sucked. That TNF vs the Falcons was a bad time. The BS OPI vs the Lions that kept us out of the playoffs in 2010 also stings a little.
I'm a Lions fan.  Too many to name
The Drive and the fumble.  Yes I’m a Browns fan.  We never ever recovered.  Until we had Belichick.  Then we didn’t have a team.  Then we sucked for 20 years.  Stop me please.
It’s the 2013 Broncos loss the the Seahawks in the Super Bowl. Over from the start in Champ Bailey’s only Super Bowl and last game as a Bronco.   I know it seems more heartbreaking to lose on the last snap, but I guarantee you it’s more heartbreaking to lose on the first.
GB / Seattle and the onside kick fiasco.
I know this is heart warming to me but breaking for others. Rams vs Titans THE TACKLE. It still brings me so much joy. Duuuuvvaal
Every patriots loss feels like the first, I’m just not used to this.
As a young-ish (almost 30) Niners fan the worst one I watched was the 2011 NFCCG against the giants. I always imagine Phil from Hercules talking about Achilles when I think about that year's team.   "Now there was a [team] who had it all...the build, the foot speed. [They] could jab. [They] could take a hit. [They] could keep on comin'.   ### "But that furshlugginer [knee] of his!"  He barely gets nicked there once and kaboom! [They're] history. Yeah, I had a dream once.
Oh boy ! Should I just pile on the Falcons ? There are too many to count being a Chargers fan
Both superbowls. Seattle goal line interception and Falcons cursed game.
The last 50yrs of Lions football 🤣🤣
Minneapolis miracle. When our safety fell over I knew we were heading to purgatory. That or the no call.
I wasn't alive for 98 so it's 2009 easily. Fuck Sean Payton and the Saints
SB XLIV and Broncos-Ravens 2012 Divisional game. Rahim Moore could never sit at my dinner table.
Packers can throw a dart at the last 10 years of playoffs and find a game, personally it’s 2021 vs the 49ers. All season, Rodgers looked good enough to win MVP with missteps, but pulling it off. The question was the defense all year with injuries stacked in the key veterans.   The defense puts on the performance of the season, giving up the 3 points to Kyle Shanahan who ALWAYS has their number. Just for Rodgers to key in on “his guys” and miss time after time to put up 7 points. Which was almost good enough until a bottom special teams proves it really was the worst at the worst time.
Yes.  Buffalo has a pretty long history of being someone else's triumph.
28-3 is the worst gut punch I’ve ever seen any fanbase take. It actually increased my interest in the falcons out if pitty and now they are in my top 5ish favorite nfl team.
Any playoff game where Mike Tomlin was the coach in the last 10+ years because they were probably the favorite and got embarrassed.
Double Doink
For my team it has to be the 1996 season where Denver lost in the divisional round to the second year expansion team Jaguars.  Denver was clearly the #1 team in the afc that year up but laid an egg that day.  I was a little kid back then and honestly it was the first time I experienced hope being dashed by disappointment.
The 2003 NFCCG game against the Bucs. Winning the title that year seemed like destiny.
2005 NFL divisional game vs the Steelers. Mike Vandershank missing the tying field goal, and the player who picked up Bettis’ fumble got stabbed by his wife before the game…….
Vikings. 1998 NFC Championship. Gary Anderson.
Billy Cundiff’s Patriots miss
Dez caught it.
Leading 27-0 vs Jags  It still hurts
Romo mis handling FG snap against Seahawks
The Drive.  I still haven't recovered.
Huh. Can’t seem to think of any off the dome.
1998. My brother and I had season tickets to the Vikings. We went to every game that year (at home), preseason, regular, postseason. First round bye, played the Cardinals and won to go to the NFC Championship Game against the Falcons. Close game the whole way, but we were ahead for most of it. 4th quarter we're up and trying to run down the clock. Robert Smith had a couple of good runs for first downs, but kept running out of bounds. Falcons end up scoring late to tie the game, but we get the ball with enough time to do something. We move the ball into field goal position and in comes Gary Anderson. Perfect kicking season to this point, and misses. Overtime. But we had some key injuries on defense and Atlanta moves into field goal range. The other old guy named Anderson comes in and nails the field goal. The most heartbreaking sports loss of my life. Even though we probably would have lost to the Broncos, we had a ton of key injuries, it doesn't make the pain any less.
Should have ran the ball!!!
I thought I might never be able to top Vincent Jackson and kicking the flag but then this years wild card game happened and that might top it  The worse thing was I could just feel it, like half way through the second quarter I just got this feeling in the pit of my stomach and knew “oh my god I think they’re gonna blow this” and they did
Texans losing to chiefs in the afc championship. Solid team and underdog story
Double doink I’ll never get over it fuck you cody parkey
Eagles v saints in 2018 when the pass just slipped right through Alshon’s hands into Lattimore’s. I was on the floor for 10 minutes. My Nick Foles Jesus candle burning on in the corner
1994 NFC Championship
As a Broncos fan it's without question 2012 playoff game against Baltimore. The Raheem Moore game.   Super bowl 48 sucked too, but we got our asses kicked from start to finish. Somehow the sudden loss hits so much harder.
2011 AFC Championship game. Lee Evans dropped a touchdown pass and then Billy Cundiff shanked a 32 yard field goal that would have sent the game to overtime. Terrible ending to a great season.
Not a fan of either team but it has to be The Tackle for me. Rams-Titans in '99. Was only 10 at the time but predicted the Titans to win the SB that year, so them losing by one yard actually made me cry.
Double doink. Fuck you, Cody Parkey.
Chargers leaving San Diego.
Bostick….
When the pats beat the raiders in the afc championship game when the refs made up a tuck rule for Brady and gave them the game, that’s when I knew it was all a show
....
Korey Stringer
Minneapolis miracle   BUT NOT FOR ME😎😎😎😎
13 seconds or wide right. Wide right because it was the Super Bowl. 13 Seconds because it was an amazing offensive game.
Double. Doink.
No comment.
Cundiff vs. the Patriots
Super Bowl 36- Favored by 14. Arguably had the Greatest Offense of All Time and lost to Adam Vinatieri and an unknown QB named Tom Brady
I’d rather not say
That one definitely hurt, seeing McGloin go down the week before too. But the most heartbreaking loss is still the snow bowl. The Raiders getting hosed by a blatant wrong call is one thing, but being the birth of the legend of Brady just hurts the soul.
I wanna say 28-3 but I still regularly think about that 2014 NFC Championship game. I still can’t believe we blew it and that easily should’ve been Rodgers 2nd Super Bowl appearance and an amazing Rodgers vs Brady matchup.  Obviously I'm biased though.
2014 NFC Game. I’m a Packers fan.… and…. Yeah. It’s that one.
As a Bears fan, Double-doink. Overall, definitely 28-3.
I mean Myles Jack was just 100% not down, so the time the refs screwed my team out of the only Super Bowl they’d ever have made.
Texans v. Chiefs in the 2020 playoffs... we were up by 24 and then just absolutely imploded.
PUNT IT OUT OF BOUNDS, JEFF!!!!!!
Super Bowl 49. I still think the Seahawks should have won that game.
Bears fan here. The Bears “double doink” loss against the Eagles tops the list for me. That defense was championship caliber and it sucks that their season came down to one stupid play.   SB XLI is a close 2nd. The Bears started off hot in the 1st quarter and then only managed 3pts the rest of the way in terrible weather, so it was a huge letdown. The playoff game vs the Eagles was closer so it nabs the top spot for me.
Chargers jaguars
Buffalo Bills. Either Wide Right or 13 seconds. Take your pick
The last Super Bowl
The AFC Championship game in 2010. That team would have won it all.
When the browns dropped that pass for a first down and had that 0-16 season. My girlfriend was chirping the sweetest “let’s go browns!”
What could have been the beginning of Matt McGloin or Connor Cook
28-3.
49
Obviously there's a lot to offset it, but 2007 sucked
The answer should be quite obvious from my username
You can't even mention 2016 and heartbreaking losses without mentioning 28-3. Sorry falcons fans.
Just run the fuckin ball Pete
As an Arizona fan, it’s got to be Super Bowl XLIII. My brother was a big Steelers fan so that made it 100% worse.
Saints Rams NFC championship game is the only answer
Well I'm old but the Browns Earnest Bynes fumbling what should have been a TD to sew up the game And Elway leading the Broncos down the field to win the game.
We had just rolled over the Patriots in a scoreline that was flattering to New England. Rex game planned a master stroke to make Brady, in one of his best years with a 14-2 record, look thoroughly average for one game. Mark Sanchez stepped all the way up. An away trip to Pittsburgh, where we had already won, was all that stood in the way of the Jets and another Super Bowl.   Pittsburgh proceeds to take the one sure thing of our defense, a staunch run game, and dismantle it in the first half for what looks like a blowout. Sanchez gives us false hope for a comeback in the second half, but it’s a false hope. Two years later, we decide to go full rock bottom for over a decade, including the fucking fool’s gold Fitzpatrick season. Four QB busts from 2009 until now, each one worse than the other, and I’ll still root for this fucking team for the rest of my life because beating the Patriots in the playoffs is one of the best feelings I’ve ever experienced rooting for several New York teams and one team in London.
The Matt McGloin year
Tuck rule fasho
The Drive and The Fumble
I started watching football about 20 years ago, so the 90s Superbowl losses didn't have an impact on me, but 13 seconds broke me
Rahim “the dream” Moore   Remember how quiet the lightrail was?
Saints/Jags 2003.  Saints pull off a miracle so crazy it has it's own name, the 'River City Relay', only to miss the extra points and lose by one.
Something something Dez caught it…
Same brother, Carr would have never had near as bad yips as he ended up developing if he never got hurt, I truly believe that
Wide right.
For it it'll always be Superbowl 40. I was twelve and more excited for a football game than I'd ever been. The whole state of Washington was alive and brimming with happiness about our first chance at the Lombardi trophy, and it ended with rageful tears of anguish.
All time - 28-3 Personal: Rams - 36 to New England
2009 NFC Championship, I know Favre throwing that interception didn’t directly cause the loss but man was it deflating when it happened. I remember just sinking into my couch after that.
Jags-Pats AFC Championship is the only sport’s game to cause tears
It's easy to pick it because it's a SB, and honestly as a panther fan, both are probably up there period. But the SB against brady..man Delhomme went step for step and throw for throw against Brady. Smitty showed up. That defense got stops and then one of the better kickers in history, has a kickoff out of bounds setting the Pats up for an easy (for stephen gostkowski) FG to win it. That game crushed me.
Pats in the 2007 Super Bowl
Seahawks Superbowl XLIX in 2015 against  the Patriots.  WHY WOULD YOU HAVE RUSS WILSON PASS WHEN YOU HAVE MARSHAWN LYNCH!!!  FU Pete Carroll and Darrell Bevell.
1999 MN vs ATL NFCCG Gary “man with the golden toe” Anderson yuge miss, misery for Vikings continues into present day
I was at the Miracle at the Meadowlands with my dad when DeSean Jackson returned the punt for the game winning touchdown for the eagles. I still can’t believe that happened till this day.
Don't mind me. Just drinking the alcohol I should be using to clean this reopened wound.
it depends honestly. for the instant pain of fans getting their hearts ripped out by one play, i would say the saints 2018 divisional game against the vikings. i may have been rooting for keenum that game, but i watched that game in a room full of saints fans and that may be the quickest i have ever seen an entire fanbase die inside. for pain spread over a longer time it has to be super bowl 51. falcons fans had to watch their team for the entire last quarter of that game, and even with the patriots losing by multiple scores, you knew at a certain point that the falcons were not winning that football game.   tl;dr, for an instant stab to the chest: minneapolis miracle, for a long tortured death: super bowl 51.
*cries in Carson Wentz collapse*
Watching the Browns KC playoff game. The helmet to helmet hit that forced a touchback was absolutely intentional and the refs had given KC a extra handicap that forced the game to be out of reach
I'm a Giants fan and I loved seeing them ruin the Patriots perfect season, but damn I gotta say that's heartbreaking because it's so difficult to get that close.
Arizona losing the Super Bowl to the steelers
Broncos Redskins.  We were up 10 at the end of the first when the wheels came off.  It wasn't immediately apparent - we went into the half down 14-10 off some big plays by the Redskins but we were very much still in it.  Then the second half started.  I didn't think it would ever happen for Elway after that loss.  I suppose it made the win over Green Bay that much sweeter in the end.
Double Doink
Tuck rule
Pain
The pats raiders game this past year. Made me think Bill has finally gone soft.
3-35
Let me count the ways
Joe Pisarcik fumble when taking a simple QB kneel down would have won the game.
That time that dude got brain damage, flipped out and killed someone.  Hung himself in jail and it came out he offed himelf so his wife would still get his retirement benefits.  I think his name was Rodriguez?  Brutal.
Certain NFCCG in 2018
That chiefs comeback in the Super Bowl. I wasn’t even mad at the nfc championship this year, I was just glad I had 3 more hours to cope of a season coming to an end than a 4th quarter collapse.
I will literally never get over LVII. I will never not be sick over it. LII wiped the pain of '01-'04 and '08. But the pain of LVII is all of those years put together.
Tuck game, Raiders and Pats
Batted ball game lions v seahawks
They had Marshawn at the goal line and threw the freaking ball! To Ricardo Lockette of all people!!!
2022 NFC Championship  2021 NFC Championship  2019 Super Bowl  2013 NFC Championship  2012 Super Bowl  2011 NFC Championship
Most recently the Rams losing to the Seahawks in a stupid fashion. I was 100000000% sure we were gonna beat the Packers that night, the real challenge was the Rams winning. I bought little Cesar’s pizza and wings to watch the game with my gf and I learned the Rams lost when I got the food. Kind of bummed me out.
Chi vs. WFT this year. Mooneys dropped catch cemented our season. Both Fields and I cried after that.
Texans beating the Colts in week 18, 2022
I’m a Seahawks fan and I don’t want to fucking talk about it.
Chiefs fan here. I was in Indianapolis on Jan 4th, 2014. Their indoor stadium was beautiful. We had a fat lead part way through the 3rd. I remember thinking 38-10.. What a masterpiece of a game. Then everything started unraveling. The rest of the game felt in slow motion as the Colts marched back to beat us 45-44. I'm so happy that better times are upon us
Packers Seahawks NFC championship. Fell asleep at the bar.
Dez, catch- fumble-touchdown.. ruled incomplete.. where was replay when it mattered
Sean Taylor
SB50 😭
The chargers losing to the raiders because Brandon Staley called a timeout instead of taking a tie. Thus ending our season and not sending us to the playoffs
NFC Championship game where Favre threw an interception to the Giants to end their season.  It hurt because my dad and I had Super Bowl tickets.
Let me tell you about the Patriots…
Probably Blair missing that field goal to lose the Vikings the game. I’m a Seahawks fan but that still made me feel so bad for him
Miami loss to Oakland in the playoffs which ended the quest for a 3rd consecutive championship
Kyle. Williams.
Kyle Williams- poor guy is probably smoking crack under a bridge somewhere now to forget about it. Not really though
marinos last game
Ever - has to be falcons Super Bowl.   My team - I don’t want to talk about it
I'd honestly prefer 28-3 to the end of the past two seasons as a Bengals fan. It's frustrating to see newfound success snatched away because of refball.
Bengals playoff game against the Steelers in 2015.    That was just soul crushing
2011-12 AFC Championship Ravens-Patriots. Lee Evans dropped TD & Billy Cundiff miss FG. That Ravens 2011-12 Ravens team was damn good. At the time it was devastating.  However, the next year was some relief after a devastating loss like that… still can’t 100% get over it till this day.
Me personally, when Miles jack wasnt down in 2017   Overall, the Seahawks losing to the Pats in the Super Bowl
2008 NFC Championship
i totally thought we woulda won with carr
The Seahawks devastating loss to the Patriots in the Super Bowl has got to be the definitive answer.

2001 rams patriots… fuck that hurt as a kid.
Check my flair and guess
1990 NFC Championship game loss to Giants that prevented an opportunity for a 3-peat.  Backbreaking Roger Craig fumble late in the game and Matt Bahr with a game winning FG.
The Comeback. That was supposed to be the Oilers year. And that second half.....fuck Frank Reich. I hate him more than Colts fans last year.
Seahawks vs patriots 😭 so heartbreaking as a seahawks fan
In person? Easy. I was at Ford Field in 2015 for the Thursday night Aaron Rodgers hail mary at the buzzer to beat the Lions. That ball felt like it was in the air for an eternity, and they still somehow left a man wide open.
Hmm nothing comes to mind tbh!!!
Bostick broke me forever. I will never invest so much energy and passion into something I have zero control over. Literally it changed me as a fan
Chip Kelly getting rid of all the Brothas on the Eagles
Seeing the panthers get destroyed by the broncos in the superbowl was sad because I thought it would be a really fun game
Ahahahahha 🤣😂😢😭😭😭😭
Seahawks with Beast Mode call a pass play at the goal line to win the Super Bowl.
Stop
I’ll give top 3 in chronological order  2002 nfc championship game, Super Bowl 39, and the one I’m not going to get over for a long time Super Bowl 57 😭😭😭
Haha.. *laughs nervously* which NFC championship game…. 😬😬
Yes.
Doink
I cried when the Bears lost to the Eagles in the 2001 season playoffs, both because of the loss and because my dad had promised to take me to see us play the Packers in Green Bay if we advanced.
The last NFL game that was played…  Heartbreaking loss for the Eagles no matter how you slice it. I won’t bother speaking on the calls that were made one way or another.
Loss to chiefs in Súper bowl 54 and nfccg at Seattle because I attended both games

Excuse me... anyone heard of Brandon Bostick?  Packers fans are haunted by this game every day. I honestly feel we would've won the super bowl. Crazy collapse at the end of the game and Rodgers didn't even get a chance to work his own magic.
13 seconds, no doubt.
I know 28-3 is the popular answer  but for those old enough, those 3rd and 4th bills super bowl losses were just brutal to watch as neutrals. the closest real life charlie brown/football scenario
Seahawks fan here
How am I not seeing Helmet Catch for us Pats fans
Amateurs… Amateurs!
My most heartbreaking NFL loss was being born in Cleveland
The 1999 Super Bowl, Titans and Derrick Mason one yard short (one foot short). I mean if we’re talking about boiled down to a moment or a single play…I don’t know if you can top it.
I’m a bears fan, I’m sure you can imagine which.
I don't like this game
Hello. Would you like to receive our informational pamphlet about the most recent Super Bowl?
So many comments. I’ll just say. MN VIKINGS HISTORY
It's the falcons patriots 28-3. It has to be
Perfect season… ohhhh nope Helmet catch / Asante Samuel butterfingers. I spent 5 figures to take my dad to that game to see history be made. Ended up giving him depression.   But we got 28-3 and the Butler int to make up for it, so he doesn’t have depression any more.
Chiefs vs. Colts 1995/6 AFC Divisional game.  The Chiefs were Sports Illustrated’s pre-season Super Bowl pick. They went 13-3. My family drove through Indianapolis two weeks prior and heard local radio playing a funny blues song called “Lord Help our Colts” about them apparently having lucked into the playoffs and having to face San Diego.  Indy beat the Chargers and faced the Chiefs, who had a bye, on what I think was a -150 degree night. Chiefs fans figured it was a slam dunk. Dropped passes, interceptions and 3 missed field goals led to a stunning 7-10 loss.  Kansas City had a few more remarkable playoff losses to the Colts in following years. (The no punt game! Losing a 38-10 lead…do the math on that Falcons fans. 😬) Of course that era is passed and I really can’t complain these days.
28-3 is too obvious. Lesser talked about heart breakers include Double Dink, Wide Right Super Bowl, River City Relay, Music City Miracle, One Yard Short. Honorable Mentions to Miami Miracle as it was just a regular season game with 0 impact on divisional standings but pretty much made sure New England would not get a first round bye that year and eventually lead them to lose in the wild card round.
It was a catch......
Tony Romo bumbling ball holder duty in Seattle still stings me to this day
Richard Sherman's swatting the pass against Crabtree in the playoffs. I sat there sad as hell and then had to watch him go off on national tv.   Brett Farve's scramble touchdown pass to Greg Lewis against the Niners when he was the Vikings QB. There is no way a 40-year-old man should out scramble 20 years olds, but he managed to do it.   I've seen more as a neutral fan, but these 2 sucked the life out of me the most cause it was against my team.
Sigh..... the last one....
As a Canadian with no connection to the Falcons what so ever.  I'd defend the position that therr isn't a single more heartbreaking loss in all of the Major American 4.  If something like that happened to the Edmonton Oilers, I would absolutely ball my eyes out.
And we coped with the idea that we’d be back…we had a window and were in denial about how long that window would be opened, we almost made it past Philly the following year but came up short on that goal line play (I still think Julio was held/interfered with). Hell of a ride but sucks that was the peak and it was all down hill from there.
Not gonna lie, as a Vikings fan who had zero skin in that game, I felt really bad for you guys. And Vikings fans know a few things about tough defeats. But that one was rough. Hated it for you guys. I live in Bham AL, so we have plenty of falcons fans running around.
Same here!
I'm a colts fan in Atl that was cheering you all on at a superbowl party and man... that was rough. I also moderated /r/atlanta for many years and got to ban a whole lot of 28-3 patriot trolls so I have that going for me.
My condolences buddy.
In all fairness I personally think the interception against Seattle was more heart embarrassing as an outsider looking in
I saw the game in a bar in Laos. There was a girl from Atlanta there. I remember her saying something like "This is the Falcons. I don't believe it until they actually win" at the 28-3 score.
I was gonna respond with “check flair” but you beat me to it and are unsurprisingly the top comment 🥲
Legit every single one of these dumbs threads I keep getting reminded of it. And if we aren't the top of the thread, everyone is lying.
Ah hem
1998 NFC Championship game?
Oh damn forgot about that one
But that's not heartbreaking. It's funny, lol. 24-3
Hey don’t be so upset look who my team is and think back 4 years ago…
The onside kick against the Cowboys was one of the weirdest things I’ve ever seen in sports.  So bizarre.
No, no, i most definately do not agree. It was only heartbreaking until about 2:12 in the third quarter.  #neverforget
It’s not even close. The Falcons blowing is hat Super Bowl is by far the worst E.V.E.R.!
Brother, I feel your pain. I’ve lived in Atlanta longer than I’ve lived anywhere, just hit 16 years, and consider it home at this point. The falcons have become my adopted team and that game broke my heart. One of my best friends, born and raised in Atlanta, went to that game. Worst part, my birthday is 3/28, so every day on my birthday, I see it all over again.
I don’t know whether to upvote because you’re right or downvote because of the terribleness of the game.
Feel this as a texas ranger fan
The 2020 regular season game at the Cowboys when the Falcons blew a 20-0 lead and eventually lost when instead of trying to recover an onside kick, all of the Falcons just stood around and stared at the ball and let the Cowboys recover it?
Yea losing to John Elway broncos is pretty sad.
The Bengals absolutely gob smacking us this year gives me peace of mind knowing that the Bengals were most definitely not a slam dunk to beat. I was convinced the Bills would have won the Super Bowl had they survived 13 seconds... and that may not have been the case.
The sports bar I work at is the bills backers bar of Birmingham, plus one of my best friends is a bills fan (hopped on the band wagon because he absolutely loved Cornelius Bennett in college). And man…. The bills SHOWED UP for that game too. One of the best sports atmospheres I’ve ever been a part of (luckily I was just there watching, not working). Packed house, phenomenal energy all game long, and then checks paid and empty by 10 minutes after the game. I felt for you guys for real.
13 seconds is more anger than heartbreaking for me, basically my whole family cried after wide right (edit: anger toward coaches and D, not the chiefs)
At least we go the movie Buffalo ‘66 because of this
Yeah everyone knows this is the answer for us
And even more recently, the victory formation fumble 😕
Giants played such a slimy game and somehow beat a way better bills team. I’m a giants fan and man I’m happy we won but that was the bills year where they really (probably) were the better team.
Watching the wide right is one of my earliest childhood memories. During 13 seconds I realized I now understood how all the adults in the room felt back then.
No Music City Miracle?
If my team ever lost a Super Bowl that way, I think I'd have to take a year off from watching.
It's been 6 years and 63 days   since you took our lead away  I go out every fall and sleep on Sunday  Since you took our lead away  Since that trophy's been gone I can do whatever I want  I can play whomever I choose   I can start a QB I drafted in the third round  But nothing  but nothing can take away these memes  'Cause nothing compares  Nothing compares to losing to you
That's it close the thread
Thanks lol
Wide right is right up there.13 seconds is a close second and then the Music City Miracle. Being a Bills fan comes with amazing highs and soul crushing lows.
IDK, 18-1 comes pretty close - the only difference is that no-one felt bad for us.
I am a Seahawks fan and I think that our loss to the Patriots compares to the 28-3 loss.
Bills Giants SB is comparable. And after that top 2, there is a STEEP drop to the next one.
But the question was, "what's the most heartbreaking loss", not what's the funniest loss!"
the perfect season SB loss enters the chat   that was painful
Not even 33-0?
Wanna bet?
19-0 vs 18-1 sure does
We’ve had some 4th quarter meltdowns but you’re right, nothing compares.
It was so bad he became a Niner fan.
Tell that to Oilers fans when they were up 35-3 in the 3rd against the Bills in the AFC championship
If they had just run the ball and punted 3 and out everytime and netted 40 on each punt they would have won.
Seahawks interception at the 1 yard line is a close 2nd. Throw the ball when you have one of the best running backs of the year lol.
Nothing compares to 28-3 (pats fan) but also Super Bowl xlii is kinda the evil twin of 28-3 and that fucking sucked
Not even helmet catch?
This is the obvious answer. I was living abroad at the time, streaming at an ungodly hour. Fist pumping and jumping around my apartment, couldn't believe it, finally getting the monkey off our back and doing it against the STEELERS with a backup QB. Magical moment. Then Hill fumbled. And I knew. I just knew. I lied awake the rest of whatever night was left. First and only time a football game made me distraught and lose actual sleep. Fuck that was brutal.
That was rough at the time and I actually stopped watching as much as I use too afterwards. I had a real apathy for the team until 2020. These last 2 years have really helped take the sting of that loss away and it doesn't bother me as much. You never know if we win that game we might not have gotten Burrow. Mike Brown might have given Lewis a 10 year extension just for winning a playoff game lmao
I smoked weed with adam Jones before…he had a hotel room right across from me.
Bro even as a non Bengals fan that shit was whaaaack and I felt for you guys.
Burfict and Pac-Man fucked that game up good. If they weren't known first rate knuckleheads I would have expected a gambling inquiry.
I'm a Colts fan and saw this one live with my Bengals fan dad. What made it worse was sitting in mid-30s rain for 3 hours just for that to be the finish. Just an absolute disaster of a game.
I was there 😞 high school me was torn up for weeks
Don't forget that the game started off with that nonsense TD catch and then there was the Gio concussion in the middle.
Just to add to the misery: Martavis Bryant caught a TD pass with his butt, and Roethlisberger couldn’t throw more than 8 yards on that final drive.  Fwiw, Antonio Brown’s descent into madness can arguably be traced to that hit.
Idk man at this point Rams Super Bowl is way worse than that  Chase wide open on that go ball while Donald plows into Burrow will haunt me forever
 Broke college kid blew my savings to be there… just to be incredibly sad. Still remember walking out while it was pouring down rain
This is one of my absolute favorite NFL memories. In college I had a buddy that came over from China who I  was mainly responsible for getting into the NFL. This was one of the first games I showed him highlights of.
Even as a fan of another team those Marvin Lewis Bengals teams were frustrating to watch.
That playoff game will live in my head for the rest of my life. That was the most brutal and crazy game I've ever seen. Those two teams hated each other with a passion.
One thing to take away from that is without that meltdown you guys may not have ended up with Joe Burrow.   Although Im convinced burfict is what caused AB to go crazy after that hit.
The overlooked part of that whole sequence is the fumble. The game was over and the only hope the steelers had was to force a fumble on that "just dont fumble" run play and that's exactly what Ryan Shazier did. The guy was just possessed and willed it to happen. He was sooo good and plays like that are how I'll remember him as a player.  https://youtu.be/61BoMpzMVcM?t=259
Fuck Joey Porter with a rusty pickaxe
I was there. It was so brutal to watch in person. Maybe worse was the incoherent rambling from the mouth breathing Steelers fans in the hotel after the game. That game crushed me. I thought we had finally gotten over the hump with a great regular season, and to lose it in such a historically Bengals fashion was a low point.   Good times now though. So…
Unpopular opinion, that sequence wasn’t called fairly. How can a Steelers coach come into the field, get into a fight, and the Steelers don’t get a flag?   It should have been the first penalty on Burfict for the hit, then offsetting penalties for the after-play BS.
With Pac Man and Burfict on the same defense something stupid like that was bound to happen
Montana to Taylor for me. I was 9 years old and that was soul crushing.  After the 90s and early 2000s you kind of expect what happened in 2016. It was heartbreaking but Marvin had no control over that team and that ending showed it.
I was at that game, in a company box. I sat there in Shock for like 30 minutes after. Was not a good evening
I was happy this happened. Not Burdict's bullshit. But I thought the Chiefs had a better shot at knocking off the Patriots than the Bengals. Ultimately, it didn't matter.
Once a Bungle, always a Bungle! Enjoyed it emensely!
To be fair, that Steelers coach had no business on the field and assaulted Pac-Man, but of course the refs only care about who finishes it...for some reason.
No. The bengals played dirty and karma caught up to them. It’s not like the Steelers won the next game though….
I still can’t believe how that game unfolded.
As a Bengals fan, what about Louis Billups dropping the interception against Joe Montanas Niners that would’ve sealed the Super Bowl for you?  Only Montana to hit John Taylor for the winning TD right after.
Yep. So fucking frustrating. Absolute Bungles game.
I saw the second half of that game and was just astonished. It was Fargo level dark comedy that yall lost that game.
Watched the end of that game at a strip club.
Still one of the craziest endings I’ve ever seen.
Ah yes, the one we’re reminded of every season when nfl media runs their inevitable  “_____ Plays of All Time” film reels
Which one? The one’s where the ref’s screwed you, or the one with the freak interception at the goal line?
The ramifications of losing that Super Bowl was deeper than just losing a championship. It caused irreparable damage in the locker room because of the Butler interception and the Seahawks were never the same again. Who knows we might’ve seen a couple more championship runs outta LOB, they were that dominate.
If there's a certain game immediately before that super bowl that I don't want to talk about... Malcolm Butler vindicated a lot of personal resentments for Packers fans.
Imagine how much that one would hurt if you guys hadn’t won the year before
Did you see the video yesterday in NFCWmemewar? It was hilarious and sad at he same time
A bird team being denied their second Super Bowl title in Arizona after having a 10-point lead after halftime? Against the best QBs of our generation? Where the game was sealed thanks to a highly controversial end?  Gee, where have we heard this before?
I don’t want to hear shit from you about Super Bowls
They ran the ball, right? I turned it off after the Kearse catch.
Too soon
Which do you think was worse? The Seahawks losing the Super Bowl like that or the packers losing the nfccg in that regard?
We were fucking rooting for you guys!! But you blew it!
There was a certain game before that certain super bowl.
>Zero and sixteen, those are the numbers that will forever be associated with the Detroit Lions."  Well, at least now they're not exclusively associated with the Detroit Lions anymore.
Tbh the 2008 year was kind of fun at the end, because we all wanted the Fords to be forcibly removed as owners and fans were openly hating on them at games lol. People went to the games to protest the fords more than they did to watch the game and there's something beautiful about hating billionaires
On the field, yes. But the most heartbreaking loss I ever witnessed as a Lions fan was Barry Sanders faxing his retirement letter to his hometown newspaper the day before training camp started in 1999.
Or try 1-31 over a 2-year span like the browns. And that one win was against the San Diego Chargers, who was immediately dismissed from San Diego a few weeks after that game.
Honestly there’s so many I couldn’t pick just one
My close friend is a Chargers fan and I was telling him in the first quarter “it’s a wrap no way in hell they’ll get momentum against you guys”  He told me the Chargers always find a way to blow it but that was bad.
I think speaking the name "Marlon McCree" can get you thrown in prison in San Diego
Marlon McCree?
If it makes you feel better SB48 was the first time I ever hosted a SB party, it also ended up with me storming off to my room and crying in the dark.
It hurt so bad man
I'm a Broncos fan, the only SB party I've ever been to was SB48. It was so depressing, and the game was not even competitive.  However the loss to Baltimore in the playoffs left me even saltier. And the loss to Jacksonville in the 90's .... Ughhhh. That was a super team that happened to collectively leave a turd on the field. I think that's the most frustrating game I've ever watched.
For me, it was our divisional round appearance in 2008 that had me crying in my Chinese takeout. Jake had come back from TJ’s surgery on his throwing arm which was apparently being held together by a rubber band and a prayer. And then I watched, through 5 interceptions and a lost fumble, as Delhomme’s body failed him in real time on national television. He’d bucked the odds after going from UDFA to NFL Europe to Saints benchwarmer, only acting as a full time starter after 6 years in the system. He’d fall to the GOAT in his first SB appearance IN 2003. I wanted so bad to see him get another shot. Instead, I watched the man’s career effectively end that night, and I knew it.
One of my good friends is a lifelong Panthers fan. He worked his way up fairly high at his job and his employers gave him tickets to that Super Bowl. How absolutely amazing - you’re in your late 20s and get a free trip with your wife to go see your favorite team in the Super Bowl. And then that. I felt so bad for him.       He said he’d have still gone even if he knew how it would end though because a trip to the Super Bowl was such a once in a lifetime experience.
You get used to getting destroyed in super bowls after about 5
holy fuck was that a shitshow last night. good thing Allbright deleted the thread, and it was late at night.
I stay up super late every night editing, so I got to witness that unfold in real time  That was incredible
Damn I thought this was like a classic thing in Broncos fandom or something, like a funny throwback, but no this literally happened 12 hours ago lmao
I thought it was a parody account when I saw that thread on my timeline. I really wanna know how he decided it was a good idea to post all of that
The last 7:30 of that game took years, maybe decades, off the end of my life.
I cried after that game. Only time I ever cried after a football game
“Just punt it out of bounds”.
Packers needed that to make the playoffs and we won the SB.  Thank you for your services Mr. Jackson.
I was physically at that game.
My son was only a few months old and my mother was visiting.  I scarred my child for life and showed my mother I was more interested in the birds than her saying goodbye on that play...  Hell, I even had to hand my son off because I couldn't stop yelling...I scared him so much he decided to become a Brown's fan...
The double doink was tough but 2013 week 17 vs the Packers for the North has to be mine. Up by 1 with 45 seconds left and Conte just leaves Cobb wide open for the TD. I think being at the game made it a little tougher though.
Ya know what? I genuinely wasn't that hurt by the double-doink. Why? Well, we were predicted to be a 4-win team that year so getting 12 and looking dominant for stretches already made me feel like that season was a massive success. Anything in the playoffs would be gravy. But additionally, Parkey had quite literally doinked 6 kicks that year. Hell, he doinked 4 times in *one single game*. There was a whole bit of drama when he didn't want to practice at Soldier because of the traffic. He had two walk-off opportunities earlier that year and if he made either of the two we wouldn't have even been playing WC weekend because we would've had the bye.   He was so unbelievably bad, that when he lined up for the kick the second time around (he made the first one but was iced) I turned to my friend, an eagles fan, and said "congrats on the win". Most bears fans knew that Parkey would be the reason we exited the playoffs at some point, it was just a question of when.
That wasn't even the most heart breaking playoff bears lose that decade
Everyone knew Parkey was going to miss that kick. The Bears offense was weak all season.
For me personally, it's:  1. Rodgers Hail Mary 2. Dallas playoff loss 3. Atlanta 10 second runoff  I only started watching around 2013 though
Right, like this topic is kinda our niche
What about the No-call on the playclock expiring for a solid “2 Mississippi” the play before Justin Tucker set an NFL record FG against us.
Ya, it's been pretty heartbreaking since the Eisenhower Administration.
Gotta be the wildcard loss to Dallas with bullshit flags for me.
I remember just saying "what the fuck", turning off the tv, and just sitting there in silence for several minutes.
You got options!  There's the game you got screwed by the refs. Or the game you got screwed by the refs.  Or the game you got screwed by the refs.  Or the game you got screwed by the refs.  Or the game you got screwed by the refs in the playoffs.
Neither the Refs nor God was on your guys side that day.
Wild playoffs in regards to this question. 3 consecutive games, you’d chose the Dez catch game, I’d choose the Bostick onside kick game, and a Seahawks fan would choose the Butler INT game.
Funnily enough, if you ask most packers fans, it’s also 2014, but NFCCG, and Seahawks with the superbowl.
Dez did catch that though.
It’s crazy as trash as our offense was and how good that D was, we went to the afccg off a 45-42 game. We were only able to put up 10 on the Tyrod Taylor bills the week before.
That was the most recent year I felt the Steelers truly had a shot to win the Super Bowl
Sure they got screwed but I can still be happy that they got screwed.
You know it was absolute dogshit when even Falcons fans agree with us lol
I’m a Vikings fan. We have a lot of hate for the saints, probably not as much as a division rival obviously, but a lot. And that was the most bullshit ending to any sporting event I’ve ever seen.
Jags got royally hosed on that play
For second place, at least in recent memory, I’d say the Week 11 game against the Steelers in 2018.  Jags started 3-1 that season, then lost 5 in a row. That Steelers game had the chance to be the comeback, they played competitive.  Then Captain Fat Fuck was able to QB sneak into the endzone and ruin the season for good.
To piggy back on that, the loss to the "undefeated" patriots back in 2007 was pretty heartbreaking. We were dominant all season and watching the game I never got the impression that they were that good. Our defense played prevent all game essentially and blah. We should have won. Will never get over it.
I was in Tokyo. Woke up in the middle of the night to see we were up 21-0. Fell back asleep and then when I woke up and saw the final score…good thing I was in Tokyo and could just fill that dopamine void..  The other most deflating moment in recent history was the Astros beating the Dodgers in the World Series. Woke up the next morning and went to the gym. Saw on the news that Deshaun Watson tore his ACL in practice.  In retrospect, I don’t care and don’t like the guy but back in 2017 he was just THE guy in Houston.
Greatest game I’ve ever been to
Damn that's rough flair man.
The vikings can't really have a truly heart breaking game because no vikings fan ever actually believes they have a chance.  Meanwhile Packers fans are still convinced they might somehow win last year's super bowl.
Fuck Rahim Moore and John Fox's lack of balls!
I find that to be more of a heartmaking loss personally.
Took me a while to find a Dolphins one. I will just take that as a good thing since maybe we don’t have any really really really bad heartbreaking losses 🤷🏽‍♂️
Such a deviating loss for a great man who did nothing but give 100% week in and week out.
The football gods were dicking with the NFC teams that postseason. Pretty sure one of us had a gut-wrenching loss every single week of those playoffs.
Rooting for the Patriots never felt better than that game.
Chargers playoff game against the Oilers. Houston's QB1, RB1, WR1, all injured and out. Chargers have a top offense, strong defense, Hall of Fame QB. Chargers still lose.
Not 2019 Divisional? You were 9-7 that year and looked lost from the start, as opposed to the blowing a 24 point lead. One game from first AFCCG appearance?
Damn same.  We have had some excruciating losses over the past 10 years but that one crushed me on a different level.  I went through rage, anger, sadness, and then rage again.  Shit ate me up for a while. I hate to say this about anyone because anyone can mess up in a game but fuck Kyle Williams.   I’m starting to boil and go through sadness just thinking about that.
i cried
Yeah that game was pretty soul crushing ngl
Brock Purdy was about to be among the best stories in NFL history. And to lose the way they did, not with Purdy actually being figured out but rather him just getting injured... Damn that sucked.
Given how much offensive talent the 49ers have, it could have been competitive with Josh Johnson at QB. But of course, he comes in, gets shoved over and fucking dies, taking the 49ers hopes with him. I wanted the Eagles to win, but that game sucked from a football standpoint
I figured this would be #1.  It’s a 17 game season now.  Plus there’s one less by-week in the playoffs.  Only one other team has ever gone undefeated in the NFL.  It’s most likely not going to happen anytime soon for any team, if it happens at all.  The Pats were a historic team anyway that year, not to mention having the NFL’s all-time greatest coach and QB (and a pretty great wide receiver + a few great defensive pieces).  &#x200B;  And the way they lost it all.  Ouch.  28-3 to is bad.  Not giving Lynch the ball at the goal line was bad.  Dee Ford being offsides sucks for my team.  But nothing compares to losing perfection on the biggest stage in one of the worst ways possible.
Ahhhh, there it is. Beautiful.
But why?  I'm very confused as I type this in my Strahan SB42 jersey.
IMO that was nothing compared to 41-0. 1998 was at least a close game against a good team. 41-0 was a bloodbath that destroyed the core of that team.
The 2018 one was worse the 2017 was your own fault but the 2018 one wasn't even your own fault
That’s the game that killed my interest in the nfl. Still support the packers, but fail mary and that game made me cut my football consumption by like… 90%
2018 AFCCG sucked, but there was a feeling of hope now that we had Mahomes going forward. So I can't call it the worst for KC.  I'll nominate the 2013 KC wild card loss to Indy. KC had not won a playoff game in two decades, and they were up 28 points in the third quarter. Then they had an epic collapse, with key guys getting hurt and weird shit happen like the Luck fumble recovery TD. That one hurt me the most (although the 1995 game also hurt)
I don’t think I agree. Their starting LT was out that game as well and we were tormenting them all game. I think even without JJ we had 4 sacks. The following game we lost to the Pats but played them extremely close for 3.5 quarters. I’m not sure they win even if Carr started.
No Vikings fan old enough to remember that season will ever trust a Vikings kicker again.
I feel like the No-Call was a similar franchise-breaking play for us. We even had a miraculous long catch of our own a few plays beforehand.
My old ass watched that game sitting on my grandparents floor on Christmas night. 1971
Man that one was a huge heartbreaker. It was so upsetting how they let them play the whole game but on that last drive they just started throwing flags.
That trip down memory lane is not a fun time lol
This a million times the Vikings beat us fair and square, the rams cheated us
Is the fact that I had to dig deep into the comments to find someone mentioning the River City Relay a sign that I'm getting old?  28-3 is more heartbreaking just because it's the Super Bowl and because of the history of the Falcons, but this is the clear runner up for me. The instant swing from an improbable high to an improbable low can't be beat, plus it's a high-stakes loss -- this eliminated the Saints from the playoffs.  Also helps that the "NOOOOO!!!!!!! ... How could he DO that!!!" from the announcer is an all-time iconic call.
The 2014 NFCCG was the worst list I can remember as a Packer fan.  It will haunt me forever
Your pain is the only one that rivals ours.
2007, 2014, 2016?
I just point to the stupid amount of turnovers they made as the reason they lost. Easily could’ve pulled away but just kept giving the ball back at the worst times.
Not even just the hits, there were some straight up garbage calls.  Their OT field goal was set up by a pass interference call where the defender literally did not touch the receiver at all. 1st down in FG range instead of 2nd & long in their own territory, makes a massive difference.
I can't believe Brett walked off that field alive. That wasn't even fun to watch
I really have no problem with Vikings fans thinking they were the better team, they dominated the stat sheet. Turnovers killed them in that game. Saints could barely move the ball and Vikings were moving it at will. What I don’t like is Vikings fans feeling like the saints cheated them out of a game. They won the game on the field, but really the Vikings lost the game on the field
still weirds me out how many saints fans cheer over blood money.
And....the irony and the real insult to injury was that Greg Williams was allowed to come back to coaching.   How he is allowed to be within 50 yards of a football facility is beyond me.
That Kyle Williams game might be the top non-Super Bowl game for me.
it's like the Calvin Johnson TD. Everyone knew it was a fumble then, except the way the rule was written it technically wasn't.  it's not that anyone thought it was FAIR, except that the rule was written that way.
I think it will always sting because we don't get to know how the game would have played out if it had been played on grass instead of ice
Same. No one said a word for about 15 mins. (Most of the people at my place weren't as big fans as i) and they all just waiting to see me react.   "I think I'm going to throw up"   *turns off TV*    didn't even watch the final play until the next day.
I'm fully on board the "Levi's South" and "Shanahan owns McVay" wagons because of that game.
Amen!
Yeahhhhhh... I could definitely analyze and choose a handful of others ahead of it but this is the first game that came to mind. It was so fucking cold.
Try years! I’m still terrified of potential game winning field goals.
That was pretty rough, but most of us didn't have extremely high hopes of a title that year anyways. Being cheated in the 2009 NFC Championship game hurts far worse for most Vikings fans. 2017 was also rough, but it was just a brutal beatdown fair and square.
That was my first year as a Lions fan.    I remember thinking "yeah that's about right" and just turning off the tv.  It would've been the first sweep of Green Bay as well since the early 90s.
I hate both teams but I’m happy with that one lol
That Seahawks NFCCG was the worst lose, cause it wasn’t just one play. Just a complete pissing down our leg trying to finish that game.
You're probably older than me, but for me it was the Sam Seale fumble.  I still think we could've beaten the Bears inthe Super Bowl.
Yes that was so rough.  We almost had that
I think the Bills 4th consecutive Super Bowl loss would rank pretty high.
Boston taking out the leafs in 2013 was pretty close.
Game six of the 2011 World Series. One strike away. Twice
*bawl
What would that even look like? Up 4-0 in game 4 of the finals going into the 3rd already up 3 games to none and lose the series?
As a saints/flames fan I couldn’t be happier if this happened
Purdue losing to a 16 might the biggest upset in the history of team sports
I know you pointed out in the American 4, but as far as heart breaks go, the 2009 Grey Cup game is up there for sure
As a Martian, with no concept of what a "falcon" even is, I was disappointed when the Klaatus vaporized the Baratas after being down five Niktos in the 4th Zaptroid of the Galactic Divisional Round. But then word came from Earth that their Atalantian Falcons were up 28-3 late in the third Kortarr of your Superb Owl.
I'm sure it hurt for Falcons fans but I have no sympathy for teams when they blow big leads
I honestly think that single loss was significantly worse than the Oilers decade of darkness period.
I’d honestly probably quit watching football for at least several years.
Agree. Arthur Blank was on the field ready to celebrate at the end of the third quarter.
At least it was their own accord for losing. That mid 2000s Seahawks team against the Steelers wasn’t even allowed that luxury. I just don’t see how you can argue anything but the Seahawks loss isn’t the most brutal loss we’ve seen in a Super Bowl.  To have one of the best seasons of your franchise just abruptly end because the refs decided you were losing that game from the beginning is just fucking brutal. In my 31 years, that’s hands down the worst officiated Super Bowl we’ve ever seen. I can’t even imagine having a Super Bowl shot ripped away purely because of which officiating crew is randomly assigned to the game.  I wouldn’t be shocked if a 30 for 30 came out exposing that officiating crew betting on Pittsburgh.
Leafs blowing a 4-1 lead in game 7 was pretty bad lol but at least that was round 1 not the finals.
Spurs fan checking in. Watching Ray Allen steal the title from us after they already brought the trophy court side haunts me to this day.
Check out the 2011 World Series.  Game 6.  One strike away.  Twice.
Didn't the Oilers blow a 3-goal lead in 3 minutes to the Ducks back in 2017?
I still think about Roloson going down in Game 1 vs the Hurricanes, man.
Julio let the ball go right through his hands, it's ok though we paid him again that next offseason
Keanu Neal jumping for a ball that if he hadn’t jumped, would have been a shoulder high pick, instead kneeing the ball right to an eagle. If that doesn’t happen, no FG and we get to be destroyed by the Pats in the SB. No way Sark dials up a game plan to win it.   That stupid hire was the beginning of the end, Neal’s knee was the icing on the cake. Such a poorly run franchise, I really wish 6 year old me hadn’t seen them on TV in 1980 and thought “wow! That’s a cool helmet, that’s my team now!”
I tip a beer in your honor!
Why would that be heart breaking to a Falcons fan?
>24-3   C’mon man. Your team actually scored 10 points against Denver, but it was pretty funny watching Von Miller go off.
I’m not so sure about that. Teams can change quite a lot in one year. The Bengals have only gotten better with Burrow having another year to gel with that offense. And we looked *unstoppable* in last year’s playoffs. Not to mention we still had Daboll, and our secondary was more in tact.     Idk you could just feel our momentum. Finally beat the Chiefs in the playoffs, then come home to host the AFCG with everyone as fired up as they were? Ya never know.
Outside of White, Buffalo was substantially healthier in the 2021 playoffs than '22. Obviously a gamebreaking talent like Chase could have won it anyway, but the Bills would have been in a much better position.
I’ll have to check your place out. I work in Birmingham a few times a year. Incidentally, the bar i work at part time, Cornelius Bennett sat at the bar for every home football game the last 2 years because his son was playing at the local college. Great guy, pretty funny too.
13 seconds wasn’t even believable. I was stuck in the denial phase until the following Sunday when the Chiefs took the field again.    It was just a mixture of confusing, painful emotions.
Well my word, I'm gonna have to check that out.
How Hostetler held on to that ball in the end zone with Bruce Smith grabbing him is beyond my realm of understanding.
The Bills were absolutely better on paper.  Offense was much better than the Giants.  Defense...I think the Giants were the best in the league that year, but the Bills weren't far behind them.   I mean arguably despite the Giants game plan essentially working as designed - they had 40 minutes time of possession, and the defense held back the top scoring offense in the league - they were set to lose with that FG that Norwood probably makes 9/10 times.
In my mind, that team really wasn’t going to make a strong run at the Super Bowl. While heartbreaking at the time, it’s well below the other two mentioned. To me at least.
Lots of fans did. For me personally, while it was heartbreaking, football isnt the end of the world so I was still hyped for next season. I mean, we were just in the superbowl, so I was still stoked for the next year.
I’ve seen the eagles lose 2 SB’s in my lifetime and even losing makes you question life. I genuinely feel bad for the falcons and wish they won that game
Lot have mentioned this, but that game really did break the fandom. Most people I know including me haven’t felt the same about the Falcons since that day. We still watch because we love them, but there is a little spark that has been missing.
I'm still not watching the falcons years later. They mean nothing to me now. I don't know if that's wrong but that game killed literally any of the love I've had for the team. I still watch the nfl all Sunday long, but I guess I don't have a team anymore. I just kinda root for whatever team looks exciting that year.
Bop
You won three Super Bowls in the six years preceding that loss, and three more in the eleven years after.     You're kidding yourself if you think that loss is anywhere near as bad as 28-3.
18-1 was horrible because you had the whole world gloating.  Truly felt terrible.  (Not as bad as the 2003 Boone walk off tho)
I did. This was well before the Gatebros stuff even began, not to mention Manning's pick-six and 28-3 bringing our fanbases together.
It’s not even close
Being a Rangers fan in 2011 triumphs both you guys
They are definitely my 1 and 2, but I think 28-3 takes the cake. The 'Hawks had just won the Super Bowl in a blowout the season before and this game was close. The Falcons have never won a Super Bowl and had what felt like a comfortable lead and then it all just went to shit.
On the other hand, it was one of the best moments of my Giants Fandom.
You won three Super Bowls in the six years preceding that loss, and three more in the eleven years after.  You're kidding yourself if you think that loss is anywhere near as bad as 28-3.
> the perfect season SB loss enters the chat   No, it doesn't.
Superbowl takes the cake every time.
No it doesnt, Give some context. Yall just won 3 within the past 7 years, and you never really had that game in hand against the giants.  Falcons have never ever won one. They were up so much with just over a quarter to go. EVERYTHING had to go wrong and it did.
The way you describe this was me exactly while I was abroad as a Broncos fan during the 2012 playoffs. When Flaco threw that bomb to tie the game I felt so sick. Like wayyy worse than the usual gut punch. When Tuker kicked that FG in OT I shut off my TV went to bed and didn’t come out of my room until Monday. Missed the rest of that weekends games after that I was too distraught. Winning in 15 made that hurt a lot worse but when I think of that game it still destroys me
Lol
Seems chill as hell
Burfict did pick off Roethlisberger for what should have been the game winning run out the clock drive.  And Pacman pushed a Steelers coach who illegally came out onto field.  Can you tell I am still salty about it?
Ehh, we were playing with house money in the Super Bowl. Sure, it stings, but starting off 2015 8-0 just to lose Dalton in the worst way possible and losing the Wild Card Game the way we did, especially in the midst of our playoff drought, against the Steelers, will haunt me more
After the SB, I was sad but optimistic. After that wild card game, I was angry and gave up the NFL for a couple of years.
For some reason I read “getting into the nfl” as you got him to play lol. I was like who’s this Chinese player lol. I’m stupid
I always saw it less as Jeremy Hill fumbling the ball and more of Shazier making an unbelievable play on the ball. The way Bengals players like to remember it is that Jeremy Hill just straight up dropped the ball, or was pulling some Leon Lett-Don Bebee type stuff. But really it was Shazier making an unbelievable play.
Dirty player…Always leading with helmet but we don’t talk about that now
>Good times now though. So…  Poor Bengo's fans, next year make sure that mayor don't get out of pocket  Fr though, Burrow is the only QB that keeps Chiefs fans up at night
If you actually watch it, Joey Porter didn't do anything at all. Burfict is quoted saying Porter was actually giving advice. Coaches from both teams are on the field, if you penalize Porter for being on the field you then have to penalize the Bengals which is just offsetting penalties. Pacman pushed a ref, you're going to get flagged everytime for that.
Shazier speared Bernard in that game. Steelers fan calling any other team dirty is laughable.
Montana tore the heart out of the city twice. I was too young in 88 to remember much about it.
Or literally any time Joe Buck and Troy Aikman call a Seahawks game...
We were this close to being a 3x SB winning organization.
Honestly, I think, for me, the Steelers one was harder. With the Patriots one, we at least won the year before. With the Steelers one, the game was over before it started with the narrative around the game being entirely based around the Steelers
Refs
You know whats crazy? The pain of the SB loss to the Steelers is so mild to the Pats loss. I’d say it’s time, but I don’t think so. I was 15 and about at the height of sports fandom when we lost to the Steelers, and it royally sucked. But nothing compares to the loss to the Pats and how everything began to crumble after that   The fact that we didn’t become a gutter team is a testament to a lot of the staff
With hindsight 40 was harder. At least the other loss was a good, competitive game. It hurt at the time, but I've come to terms with it. 40 still gets me salty. That was such an atrocity, that like the saints PI, even our worst enemies were on our side.
I would’ve flown straight to Buffalo.
How about Superb Owls?
**LAWL.**
I have no sympathy for the Packers right now come back to me in 3-5 years
We always look out for our r/lakeeriebros
really? no one I knew felt anything fun about that season. it was more just like hopeless despondence.  hating the Fords is of course a time honored tradition.
You can go through the hits. My body is ready.
The Chargers always find a way to fuck up.  Saying that as a 30 year bolts fan.  Please stop sucking a the run defense.  I don't know how the fuck we got Mack and Bosa but can't stop a middle tier running back.  Like, I guess we kinda just suck.
Go Jags!
Honestly, Marlon McCree incident is more heartbreaking than 27-0.
>Marlon McCree  OH MY GOD. I saw this game live and remember the heartbreaking ending.  But I definitely repressed this moment until just now.
Add Troy brown in there and it would probably set off some triggers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-HcGNOVEDc
I could never see myself hosting a superbowl party that my team was involved in. I watched SB54 with a couple good buddies and just watched intently and quietly (and later, angrily). We barely spoke a word to each other at half time.   But another friend invited me to the eagles/pats superbowl, and it was great, since we felt no pressure, just enjoyed the game.
I drank half a fifth of grain alcohol by halftime so I know that pain
I never really watch Panthers games in groups. Maybe I’ll have a friend over to watch but that’s it. I let my wife convince me to go to a friend’s Super Bowl party to watch the game. Just was miserable the entire time and then the game happened and my wife and I were just silent the entire car ride home. I didn’t talk to anyone until some time the next afternoon.
I don't invite people over to Broncos Super Bowls. I stopped watching this game after Harvin returned the 2nd half kickoff.
I watched it from my dad's hospital room (he's fine now) and he got cut off from the pain killer button for a bit.
At least for 48 I could just check out in the third quarter. It's nice to start the healing early. But that was the most crushing first half I've ever seen, I wasn't old enough to watch the '80s super bowls.
I still can't believe we have only had one winning season since then.
Cotchery fuckin caught that ball bro 😔
We should have won the SB that year we lost to Baltimore. Such a good team. That’s my vote for most heartbreaking Broncos loss. SB 48 was just disappointing, we were never in the game
Wait what  Edit: [wtf lol](https://nypost.com/2023/04/07/broncos-reporter-benjamin-allbright-makes-bizarre-twitter-sexting-confession/)
I’m guessing booze was involved. But everyone has moments of weakness where we make a Hail Mary play, just.. most of us have like 15 people who will see not 100,000.
Did we ever learn why he didn’t punt it out of bounds?
Life defining moment   At least he didn’t end up an Eagles fan 😉
We don't speak about That Who Shall Not Be Named in regards to the Bears
This is the one for me.  We FINALLY have a good offense and then the defense shits the bed and ruins the season with less than a minute left.  I didn't talk to anyone about football until the next season after that one.
The 2010 Nfc championship was more brutal because of how close we were to the SB. Also bc it was vs the Packers
He didn’t want to practice there because of *traffic*? What a loser
On the other hand, it hurt bad to me because Pace went all out to build a roster quick, had a historic defense, and still got knocked out in the wild card. I was hopeful for Trubisky back then, but I still thought the road really only gets harder from there.  It was a magical season with a very pedestrian ending.
Exactly this. I wouldn’t go as far as to say I expected it, but there was maybe 5% of me that was thinking he’s going to bounce this thing off of the post. I initially didn’t even see the second bounce because when I saw it bleeding to the left I knew what was about to happen and walked away. 2010 or 2013 was worse in my mind.
I just feel the need to mention that the double doink was tipped by Treyvon Hester. You could see it in the replay at the time and I’ve never liked the shit Parkey got for it. Yeah he’s not very good but that one was tipped
The Dallas playoff game with the no call Pass Interference comes to mind
Honorable mention to the Texans game where the Refs and Rules gave the Texans a free TD. A TD that was the difference between a win and a loss.   That one really pissed me off.
The Rodgers Hail Mary was such a crushing, demoralizing defeat. They led for 0 seconds of the game and still won. That is such a Lions stat. I remember seeing the Packer in the endzone catch it and just collapsing to the floor with my hat over my face. Total disbelief but also a really deep sureness, like "of course that's what happens." Sports will make you understand that curses are actually real.
Once again reminding people that the Rodgers Hail Mary only happened because of a phantom horse collar call the play before
What about the 66 yard field goal by Justin tucker that should have never happened because the play clock expired on Lamar the play before that set up the kick.
i remember watching the rodgers hail mary with my dad, who told me beforehand that detroit will find a way to lose. the feeling i had when he caught the hail mary was a feeling i’ve never felt before or since, of just complete shock and hopelessness.
Double hands to the face was pretty infuriating
The thought in my head after that was are we going 0-17
You’re forgetting the missed pass interference with the Lions against the Cowboys
Oh yeah our D was absolute dog tier. Had a gut feeling after y’all beat us in house earlier in the year that a repeat was coming.
Blake Bortles becomes the passer we took 3rd overall against the Steelers and Patriots only
This guy rivals
Falcons **and**  Rams fans are more likely to concede that fact than Vikings fans are.
I remember that game, it was supposed to be the Sunday nighter but they flexed out of it for a Vikings game that was a snooze fest.
Reversely, I was in shock of that game. Y’all typically just have our number lol.
‘98 NFC Championship Game has to be the worst, right?  Just an incredible season snuffed out with a missed FG and taking a knee. The knee was what really pissed me off, that offense could have gotten us within FG range with the time left on the clock.
I can tell you're a fan of neither of these teams.   Vikings fans don't believe they can win the Super Bowl until week 14 or so, where they suddenly become certain they will because hey we've won 9 in a row and its finally Our Year^TM.  Packers fans are all afraid they're going out in the NFCCG even though they win the Super Bowl every decade.
It's nice seeing other people put blame on John Fox for that game too, his lack of balls with one of the best offenses ever was way more unforgivable than a bad player making a bad play.
That's Ravens legend Rahim Moore tyvm
The Jags playoff win this year felt like that to me, so I get it.
Yep. Refs screwing the Lions against Dallas. Dez no catch against Green Bay. Brandon Bostick throwing the game to Seattle. Malcolm Butler. Karma’s a bitch.
No because in hindsight, we lost to Reid + Mahomes. That doesn’t make me sad, we’re just the first absurd comeback in their legacy of many. I was rarely upset when we lost to Tom Brady except the 2016 playoffs when we should have won if Will Fuller had not dropped a perfectly thrown touchdown pass.  2015 will always hurt worse because JJ was never the same and Hoyer’s turnovers directly contributed to that. If we had had JJ in 2016, we would have beaten the Patriots and gone to the AFCCG.  EDIT: Actually I just went back and watched highlights of that game and I must be remembering it wrong. Fuller for sure dropped a TD, but it was much earlier in the 3rd quarter. I thought it was mid 4th. And we were behind by 9 at that point. We weren't beating Brady that year.
JJ is in the Houston sports pantheon with Earl Campbell, Warren Moon, Rudy T, Moses Malone, Hakeem Olajuwon, Clyde Drexer, Jeff Bagwell, Craig Biggio, Yao Ming, James Harden, Jose Altuve, and Andre Johnson.  That other guy isn’t.  Nothing will ever sting like watching a moment like JJ going down and knowing he was never the same again.
Idk about OP, but by 2019 losing like that didn’t even surprise me. Idk what it was about the Texans at that point with BOB, but it wasn’t a surprise that meltdown happened to me. But the injury problems for JJ just never went away after that 2015 game and, while in hindsight, JJ is just so much more to me as a fan than Watson could ever be, so the sting has lingered longer.
Me too
talk to an Eagles fan and they’ll probably try to tell you that Purdy got figured out
There were so many plays that could have changed the game too.  The Assante INT drop, the helmet catch/Eli in the grasp play and the fumble recovery that wasn't recovered all win the Pats the game if they happen the other way.
Stop typing. I can only get so hard.
41 doughnut did hurt but that felt different.  1998 felt like we were looking at a super bowl favorite.  They had a season close to the patriots helmet catch year but without the other rings to point to to feel better.  41-0 was more of a realization that our team just wasn’t a contender anymore and it’s rebuild time
I disagree, if you get screwed over on a bad call you can at least complain about it forever.  That’s something.  If you just lose you don’t have anything.
That was absolutely gut-wrenching. After that game, I told my brothers Rodgers won't get back to a Superbowl with GB. I hate it when I'm right about that shit.
This is mine. On top of all the historical shit they could have overcome if they won, it was my first time going to any sport playoff game since I was still in college at the time. It was so heartbreaking.  On the plus side, Indy fans were fucking awesome after. I've since gone to way more games around the country and fans typically suck, specially ours if we're being honest.
I’d argue the worst loss of the Mahomes era was 2021 AFC championship game, because the offense did nothing in the 2nd half.
That 2016 Raiders team gets overrated pretty heavily. Had Carr not been injured and the "what if" tag gets lost, they are probably remembered more like the Vikings this past year.
It’s like they had a quota to complete and didn’t throw enough flags during the game so they had to improvise
Bostick, haha dix dropped pick 6, lost in the sauce giving up a free tuddy, daniels taunting penalty, Crosby (still I stan him, but rough year for him), Rodgers getting ducked over by the refs on the no call offsides INT, dropped passes. Ugh
I stopped taking football as seriously after that game.
yall lost more than we won. you cant win a game with 5 turnovers in most cases
Vikings fan. Pains me, but this is ultimately correct. The calls make no difference if we don't fumble 3 times.
Yes because the Saints are the only team in nfl history that had a bounty program. Even farve said it wasn’t a big deal.
Yeah, it's crazy. No way the Saints would have done everything possible to win that game if they didn't have a bounty program.../s
Do some research on the actual facts that occurred, because clearly you haven’t and you’re regurgitating a narrative that’s convenient for you
https://www.usatoday.com/story/gameon/2012/12/12/nfl-saints-bounty-smith/1764161/  Yikes
I may go 10 years before I ever watch that game or those highlights again
Yep those shots of Zimmer’s bright red nose, players very visible breath and almost frozen turf are what accentuates that loss in my mind
Don’t blame ya that attempt was as easy as it gets
The first one of that series alone, Norwood's wide right FG, is heartbreaking enough.  Was their only real chance at winning one. The following 3 SBs they just didn't have as good a chance.
I love that YT video of the Leafs watch party interspersed with the scores. Joy to just sadness.
Beating the yankees while down 0-3 is a close 3rd
No judgement (despite the fact that you are a disgusting flames fan)   How does one become a Saints Flames fan?   Maybe you just like really intense rivalries?
I’m a Falcons fan and a Purdue alum. I give up.
The 13th man. an absolutely brutal fucking finish.
I don’t know man. Andre Iguodala hitting that game winning 3 with the fate of the universe on the line was pretty clutch. That man single-handedly dismantled your death beam and completed the ultimate underdog story. Blowing a technological advantage like that is pretty disappointing ngl.
I think I would agree. The Decade of Darkness sucked, don't get me wrong, but I don't think there is a worse way to lose than to choke.   But to choke that hard, in a game that big, against the patriots dynasty, only to have brady come back a couple years later and win it with a different team in your fucking stadium.  A loss that bad for Oilers might make me take a  couple years of hockey. The Falcons loss is that fucking bad.
Jessie Tuggle's fucking son was playing for the Falcons too. Like God damn.
Getting fucked by the Refs sucks, and it sucks 100x on the biggest stage but I do not think anything is worse than a choke.   There is an Anger that i really think has a soothing effect.    That seahawks club is  absolutely an argument that you could make
They Did and it hurt.
What kills me about that game more than anything is Conkiln takes the blame when it was not his fault it was the players fault.   When handling the puck behind the net it was Rolison's tendency to stop the puck dead and leave it, and Conklin's tendency to give the puck a tiny push towards the player.   These are both normal things for a goaltender to do and the players should have been aware of that Tendency.   But yeah, I'm 30 years old and all and all the game 1 might be the worst moment of my Oilers Fandom.
Most Falcons fans I know love to blame Matt Ryan for the team’s lack of success, instead of Julio’s almost-annual demand for a new contract. Never made any sense to me.
It was sarcasm because it would be the last thing they would say while it is near the top of what a Vikings fan would say.
Just playing.  Falcons are the only team on the division that I can tolerate.
I was convinced we would win it all if not for 13 seconds. After reading what you said, I’m now thinking the opposite. The Bills riding high with Allen playing the best postseason for a QB in history and hosting an AFCCG sounds like the exact type of game we would lose.
But also look at the giants coaching staff. The had Parcells, belichick and Coughlin. Plus a bunch of guys that had stellar careers.   Probably the best roster of coaches with the exception of the 1959? I think giants.
I think I felt like if we won, we sort of stole it, I mean Rob Johnson?
We did have a top 2 defense that year and the Titans were the team that ended up in the Super Bowl. Robosack Johnson and his lack of mobility cost us that game just as much as the Titans special teams. If Flutie had played, I think we lose our 5th super bowl that year as the Rams were unstoppable.
If the Bills win that game, the Jags win the Super Bowl.   The 1999 Jaguars went 14-2 and all three of their losses were to the Titans.   The Bills-Colts divisional could have gone either way since it was both Peyton Manning's first playoff game and the first playoff game hosted in the city of Indianapolis but the Jaguars would have beaten Buffalo had they overcame the Colts in the AFCCG.
One of my friends is a falcons fan. He has a rule in his house that no one can mention that Super Bowl ever. The  thing is he doesn’t even get mad when that rule gets broken, intentionally or unintentionally. He just gets quiet with this thousand yard stare for a few seconds and has to have anything that was said in the interim repeated to him.   At first it was a little funny at first but seeing how after all these years it’s still having that same exact effect, virtually no one has broken that rule in years.
So I guess it finally hit you when you made your username?
At the end of the day, no matter how shitty it feels you have to be happy to see your team make a superbowl. Espcially a team that rarely ever gets that far.
As an avid Patriots hater, I did take a year off lmao. I don’t like the Falcons by any means but I was right there with you guys in feeling sick.
Losing three straight nfc championship games was worse than losing the Super Bowl for me. Twice we lost to inferior teams. We would have beaten the raiders in ‘02 IMO.   Losing to the pats in ‘04 was bad, but I knew deep down they were the better team. Same with rams in ‘01.
100% with you. I was never one to get upset about a loss. Just happy to enjoy the game. But honestly, after that game, what is there to enjoy? Even when they’re up 28-3 (which hadn’t happened since I might add), it’s not a fun experience. And if you can’t enjoy being up by four scores, what can you enjoy?
Typical pats fan trying to act like they had it rough
How is it not close? 2014 Russell Wilson and Marshawn Lynch at the goal line while trailing late in the fourth was almost as sure a thing as being up 28-3. No one in Seattle thought we could lose that game… until it happened.
it should be   it was a glorious win for them
i get your point, but everyone was writing history before it happened, yes it was very painful
To other teams fans it probably sounds ridiculous, but that shit stung so bad.   Greatest team/QB/Coach to ever step foot on a football field yet they lose the biggest game of the year to a team that was a 4 or 5 seed and had a bozo at QB.  def not worse than 28-3 but it was a waste of an entire perfect season
The Patriots were a Planck length away from an unprecedented achievement. Even with all their rings, that has to sting. If you're old enough to remember the 1990 NFCCG and barely missing out on a shot at an unprecedented Super Bowl threepeat, then you should know the feeling.
Things have gotten a little better since then if you haven't noticed.
He actually is we had a conversation on the elevator and found I smoked weed and offered to smoke…which of course I matched him. But he just ended up telling me no save it.
I believe when Burfict got that interception - (quick sidebar)  which was off of Landry Jones, not Roethlisberger, as Roethlisberger had been carted off to the locker room after getting injured by ....... wait for it ..... wait for it .... you probably guessed it .... Vontaze Burfict! (omg wow omg no way) when he sacked him and landed on his chest with his full body weight (no flag - not sure if that was a penalty back then). A bengals fan threw a beer can at him while he was getting carted off as well, but Ben paid him back as he would return to lead the game winning "drive"  \- (back to Burfict interception) to celebrate this interception Burfict ran all the way down to the other side of the field, through the endzone, and into the tunnel while waving goodbye. Ironically, if he actually had left the game the Bengals probably would have won!
Burfict actually picked off Landry Jones on that drive as Ben had left with an injury. Ben came back in after the Hill fumble. Not that it matters really but figured I’d point it out.
Your just mad about the OTHER fumble he forced in that same game which is understandable. He wasn't dirty but his tackling form was bad and he paid the price.
Lmao no way that dude wins another election
But the bengals are dirty team just like the ravens were and almost as dirty as the browns…. Ok the browns are far dirtier as of recent but seriously that bengals team didn’t belong in the playoffs and would have lost the next game anyways
My own experience was the opposite. I was supremely pissed about 40 but also wasn't following football as closely at that point. Plus, to me, losing in 49 ruined what would have been one of the coolest possible team narratives: becoming the most recent team to win back-to-back championships by beating both 1) the previous two teams to hold the same record, and 2) the two QBs who were then the frontrunners in the GOAT conversation. Sigh.
Winning 48 made the Pats loss a bit more bearable.  At least we have 1, which is way more than a lot of teams can say.    But man XL.... so many of those guys deserved a ring and Seattle was an insanely talented team that year.
I was so freaking tired of hearing about the freaking Bus.  Even my Steeler fan husband thought that game was garbage.
Couldn’t agree more.   Let’s not forget that the three main cogs in the LOB were legitimately injured heading into that game, and we lost Lane early (Simon got torched) and Avril as well. The corpse of our defense almost pulled it out.
Didn’t Bettis get MVP for running like eight yards or something dumb? Steelers so annoying.   That said, the Seahawks played like shit in the game. I never understand the penalties but at least Leavy admitted he fucked up. The nfl spent a year pretending to replay pass interference after the saints-rams shit and still used it once to fuck over the Saints lol in an all-time Dean Blandino sends his regards moment
Bills 0-16 when
https://youtu.be/09AlSklcO3Q  This song is the vibe of 0-16 for me: you're pitiful and you're mine lmao
You ain’t even on the list monfrer
When Ray Rice broken 37 tackles to convert a 3rd n forever, i just accepted that i cheer for a soft ass franchise lol.
100%. That ‘06 team was easily one of if not the best chargers team ever. This past years team was in no position to win it all
Easily, most depressed Ive ever been from sports  edit: Parker also inexplicably muffed a punt for no reason that game as well, Pats didn’t even dislodge it iirc he just dropped it like wtf lmao
Marlon McCree... Former Jaguar
Watched the Har-bowl at a friend's house who was a Niners fan. Moment the game ended, he kicked over a table and shouted, "THATS IT. GET THE FUCK OUT."
I hosted that Superbowl. In the end, we had a great time. However, I also hosted the Superbowl 55, and that was a pretty shitty night lol
Were you tryna sanitize your brain?💀
Don’t beat yourself up. I don’t think we have a single 1 since
Would've changed the game and you can't convince me otherwise. Von wouldn't have gotten that fumble TD. That Broncos offense was a lame duck and despite them "destroying" us it was still a one score game for most of the runtime.
Holy hell what a disaster that turned into lol
He said he did it completely sober
He was dodging his responsibilities.
He’s got a nice place in the Shadow Realm. However he did have one of the greatest Superman ints I have ever seen
100% this game. Losing in the NFC title game to the fucking Packers of all teams. Especially cuz I think we could have won it if Cutler didn't get hurt. Packers going on to win the SB was salt in the wound.
Undoubtedly
It seems like everybody is wfh these days so why can’t I?
Too many cars were getting hit by his missed kicks
If it wasn’t a pattern you would have had more people give him sympathy but it was a pattern and all the misses he had through the season culminated to that moment. Also didn’t help that there were reports saying he refused to practice at Soldier Field which is historically one of the hardest places for kickers to kick at.
I don't think Bears fans at large hated him for missing as much as we hated him for leaving to go on a bunch of talk show spots the next day and talk about how he's at peace with missing because he knows it's all in god's plan. Dude felt zero obligation to his teammates or coaches and decided to monetize his fuckup instead of owning his failure or acknowledging that maybe he should've actually gone to soldier to practice kicking like the Bears coaches were begging him to all season
And Dez running helmetless to midfield to argue with the refs the year they made it a Personal Foul for being helmetless on the field. Dude was there for what seemed like forever and no flag.   At that point, just accept the bribes while on the field.
As a Ravens fan, I’m disappointed Justin Tucker didn’t make the list.
Lions fans remember. Packers fans like to show a screenshot of the Lions player's thumb touching Rodger's facemask, ignoring the part of the rulebook that says a facemask penalty requires a "grasp, control, and turn or twist"
i don’t want to be that guy but it feels like 80-90% of huge plays against the lions are helped out by the refs on the previous play
I felt great going into the game because Big Ben just seemed to fall apart every time we played. If you told me he would ball out on us like he did and we’d still win, I wouldn’t believe it.
Yeah and the arrogance we had, “if we just don’t throw 6 picks like we did in the regular season, we beat these guys…well the defense has to stop someone too smh
Don't get it twisted, there's no denying you guys were robbed.  &#x200B;  But don't expect me to feel bad about it...
I don’t think it’s about fandom. I think it’s just if you’ve ever watched the play…
I'm a Vikings fan and totally agree the Saints got screwed in the 2018 NFC Championship game.
I'm a Vikes fan and I was disgusted at that call.
And that game (the Jaguars game) was immediately followed by the worst game of the entire season, which said Vikings game followed.  Thankfully, the best game of that entire season came 25 hours after that.
Ive been downvoted into oblivion on the broncos sub for saying John fox held this team back more than he helped it. We didn’t get good because he was the coach, he got a good record because of manning. We would have won another superbowl without fox.
Yeah people don’t remember that there was maybe 26 seconds left on the clock with 2 timeouts *after* the Miracle. I remember being shocked back then that the Broncos didn’t at least attempt to get into field goal range with such a high powered offense.
By lack of balls do you mean the fact they didn’t try to get anything in the last 30 seconds of regulation or just no balls in that game in general
To be fair, the Dez non catch was correct officiating.  The rule had just been changed and it's a dumb rule.  Packers got screwed by the same rule earlier that season.
Lmao why is like water coming out of my eyes tf?
I mean the players basically said exactly that  "They couldn't block us"
Don't need the "probably".  I was being told for weeks that the Eagles would beat a healthy Purdy by 30+.
Completely agree. Especially in a situation where it's so obvious no one disagrees you got screwed
Went to a chiefs-colts game in Indy recently. It’s incredible how great the fanbases for both teams are. Just a great atmosphere overall, especially after the game.
Yeah fr. I guess the one thing I can say is the Rams got hosed when Higgins twisted Ramsey’s face mask on the long TD. But the lack of consistency was so annoying.
Bro people im here dont research . Brett favre literally said the vikings did the same thing and he said he saw nothing wrong with the hits .  Kurt warner expressed similar sentiments lol
Literally wouldn’t even be a playoff team if you weren’t hunting the opposing teams stars for sport.
God I love the salty tears of saints fans. Your home boy Gregg Williams was caught on tape multiple times giving bonuses to players for injuries. I'd advise you to do some research of your own.
Umm…what’s up with your flair? Lol
Oh, i haven't gone back and actually watched. I just caught the last play on a meme page. I haven't been able to go back yet either, probably won't for a long time. Just pray this isn't a Marino situation with Hurts, all I hope for.
I don't watch hockey, but I would totally watch this if you have a link.
I was underneath at North Station waiting for the Downeaster northbound when the tying shot happened. It was crazy.
Haha I’m from Mobile Alabama so saints came naturally. Flames comes from NHL14 which was my first time trying to get into hockey; the flame’s drafted me and I’ve been ride or die ever since
You like pain if those are your teams
what's crazy is how much heat Klaatus' general manager, Florbgorb XIII, got when he drafted Andre Iguodala, a role player, from Golden State when they left Klay Thompson unprotected in the expansion draft.   Literally no one understood that decision, but in hindsight they really needed Iguodala's advanced knowledge of Baratas death beam.   they are the only team in the league that run the Imvalitron septicon, rather than the Imvalitron vectorphone. Florbgorb XIII knew that Andre played that system with the Arizona Wildcats.   That's why FG13 is the GOAT.
It’s the lazy argument/easy copout. I could write an essay on why it’s entirely false, but I won’t put y’all through that.   He’s the best QB in franchise history and statistically, one of the best/most clutch QBs in NFL history.
Lmao. When you put it like that.    Never have I so disliked something I agree with.
Crap on Johnson all you like, but he walked off the field with the lead.
It wasn't a crazy idea to bench Flutie for Johnson. Flutie's arm tired down the stretch, and he struggled as a passer.  However, this particular game and setting made for the worst possible circumstances for Johnson. Rob was a great passer, but he had a poor feel for the pass rush, and took too many sacks. The Bills offensive line was banged up in the playoffs and featured several backups. The Titans were undefeated at home, and there was loud crowd celebrating Tennessee's first playoff game. "The Freak" Jevon Kearse was the DROY.   You didn't need PFF to figure that Flutie would have been the best candidate to face the loud crowd and Titans pass rush behind a makeshift offensive line. Doug faded as a passer in 1999, but he was great at evading pass rushers; he had a sixth sense for feeling the pressure, and evading it.
>Robosack Johnson and his lack of mobility  You're confusing Johnson with Drew Bledsoe. Johnson was mobile; he was a great athlete, and he could run. His problem was mental. He didn't process things as fast as he should, and didn't have a feel for the pass rush.
PTSD from watching football is insane 😂😭
Thankfully I was only like 10 for the first loss. Loss to the chiefs hurt but it was a great game and I loved the team. The foles win still feels like a fever dream.  I’m so hype to have Hurts and hope he’s our QB for years
I’m sorry but that buccaneers team had an all time defense. There’s no way they were anything close to inferior.
I know you ain't calling the Bucs with FOUR HOFers on defense the inferior team in 2002.  Or 2003 when we opened your new stadium the same way we closed the Vet.
***”We would have beaten the Raiders in ‘02 IMO”*** **No.** ***No, you wouldn’t have.*** If the *Raiders,* played *ANY OTHER TEAM,* than, f—king Chucky’s Buc’s…We would have won. Raiders were on fire that year.
The panthers beat down was traumatic
Hard to describe, your franchise has never been hated like the Pats were, especially that year.  It was the year of spygate remember.  And a lot of Pats fans are red Sox fans too, prior to the past two decades, we had it rough boy.
Difference is Seattle won a Super Bowl.  That was Atlanta’s peak with great team and they slowly fell apart after that season.
Your franchise has had more success in the last twenty years than any other has had in any human lifetime. If you can't be happy with that then you can fuck right off.
I totally get that, but all I'm saying is it doesnt compare to 28-3
Calling Eli a bozo is pretty rude..That’s a future HOFer man…
not gonna lie, im not. Born in 87. I just cant imagine telling Falcons fans that "you dont know what its like" when the Patriots won 6 superbowls in 20 years, compared to zero.
Yeah, but LOL
He owns a share of some weed company so it's a business expense and he was trying to get new clients.
Big Ben is a rapist and deserves to have trash thrown at him everywhere he goes for the rest of his life.
Soooo since you wanna get snarky, Burfict actually ran into the tunnel to give the ball to Giovani Bernard...who left the game with a concussion after getting knocked out on a cheap shot from Ryan Shazier...who was dancing on the logo about 25 yards from where an unconscious Gio was receiving treatment.
Yeah I’m sure he only led twice…And never got told it was a dirty way to tackle or that he could really hurt someone that way
Bettis didn't get MVP. I think it was Ward, but the whole narrative was Bettis' final game and it was in his hometown.  It was honestly a pretty garbage game all around, but it definitely should have been closer than it was
The poor mans hard reboot. It's like pulling the plug on your computer instead of shutting it down, you will remember most basic things,  but there are going to be memory gaps.
Same boat as us with one winning season. Wtf happened to our teams?
And that it specifically was not a Hail Mary play
I mean Caleb Haney made it way more interesting than he had any right to
It also hurt a lot because of the speculation that cutler actually could have finished the game (I doubt he actually could have) but it kind of confirmed what the Bears fans feared that he would never quite be the guy. That was definitely his opportunity to change the narrative of his career but unfortunately he got hurt. His body language and expressions were just so negative all the time, and "quitting" on the team was just the icing on the cake. But alas that spawned "Smokin Jay" which will live forever lol
Fucking fat ass Chris Christie jiggling up and down hugging on Jerry Jones while it’s all happening made me even fucking madder
You see, the thing is there's just so many to pick from, that you end up forgetting some. Heck I just remembered the batted ball game against the Seahawks.  But you're right. That Ravens loss sucked pretty bad. I stare at play clocks so much more than I ever did before.
Ngl it was meh one. But as a Pack fan, the only face mask that was never called that irked me was 2009 Wildcard vs Arizona. In overtime Rodgers was rushed and the defender turned his head nearly 90 degrees, he fumbles Arizona wins. Refs never call it. Was a banger of a shootout til that happened. In the end I can't say whether we would beaten the Saints in the next round, and I sure would hate to take away the 1 ring Brees got, so in the end it kinda works out  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZCbmc0IIM4
Packers fan. You Jags flair because of the Cheese League? Just saw them training when I grew up.
They did the same at the half too.
Yeah, not going for the field goal with 30 seconds and multiple timeouts and instead going to overtime with the Ravens having all the momentum
Not going for it at the end of the game. He had 2 timeouts, and with one of the most potent offenses in the NFL. Pathetic to have Peyton kneel the ball and take a chance at getting burned in OT.
Even most defensive players have said yeah every locker room I was in had similar programs like that. It was just how the game was played. The league just wanted it out if the game and the saints were the team that they found proof of it. So they made them an example.
We were below average in injuries caused during that period. You can’t honestly think we were the ONLY team doing that, it’s beyond delusional.   The phrase “kill the head and the body will die” was painted on the locker room in Kansas City in 2008
R/VikingsTrophyCase
Teams hurt eachothers stars every year, with or without bounty programs. It's not even just a thing in the NFL, it's happens all the time in European soccer - if you know someone's got a bad knee you touch it one time too many.
We won, why would I be salty? Ok fine, here is some info if you care to read.   tl;dr  The coaches never admitted to paying for injuries (despite what r/nfl would have you believe). They said there was a pay for performance pool, which paid for interceptions, fumbles, and yes, big hits - but players didnt get paid if a hit was illegal or flagged. Goodell also never produced any solid evidence to back up injuries - just circumstantial evidence and evidence backing up the pay for performance pool.   Roger Goodell claimed the Saints had a system from 2009-2011 where they would pay to specifically injure other players. He claimed to have several thousand pages of evidence of this, but refused to show it to anyone. Instead, he said what some of the evidence was, and the media went to town taking his word for it.  The coaches and players never admitted to any bounties - only to a pay for performance program, where you would get bonuses for interceptions, fumbles, big hits, etc.  But by then, public opinion was easily swayed by the media showing one hit on Kurt Warner, a few hits on Favre, and playing one audio tape by Gregg Williams, over and over and over and over, while still not asking to actually see any of the other evidence Goodell had.  To further advance the farce Goodell brought in a "special investigator" Mary Jo White, who claimed they had received a signed confession from a player, so the case was basically open and shut.  But then the NFLPA leaked the "confession" and it wasnt a confession.  Goodell said he had the bounty ledger, full of pages of a history of payments for "cart offs" and other injuries. Except when they released a page that had "cart off" payments on it, it was for a game where no one had been injured. The NFL quickly revised their statement saying it was actually for a different game.... that also didnt have any injuries in it.  The NFL then said they had a powerpoint presentation from Gregg Williams to the defense that specifically references bounty payments.  Except the NFLPA leaked that one too, and it was a ridiculous Dog the Bounty Hunter themed presentation that was just creating metaphors for their gameplan to the popular-at-the-time TV Show.  Those are just a few examples. Basically, any time Goodell said he had evidence, and it got leaked, that "evidence" didnt say what Goodell said it did.  And yet no one in the media really cared about all the inconsistencies. They kept writing their articles about how shameful all this was. Getting on their soapboxes. Pete Prisco, in 2011, had said the Falcons shouldve injured Drew Brees to keep him from breaking the passing record against them. But then he became the biggest critic of "Bountygate".  The whole thing was a giant media shit storm created by Goodell, because the league needed a scapegoat to look like they were "tough on player safety" ahead of the retired players concussion lawsuit. And it apparently worked, because the league got off BIG TIME with the relatively small settlement the judge awarded.  Basically, Gregg Williams is an over-exaggerating asshole who uses harsh language to fire up his team. But to this day there is no solid evidence of any payments for actual injuries. The details of the pay for performance plan even specifically pointed out that players didnt get paid a bonus for any illegal hits. And from 2009-2011, the Saints were near the bottom of the league in personal fouls and opposing team injuries.  Now, pay for performance was certainly illegal in terms of violating the salary cap. But the media firestorm and outrage wasnt over the salary cap violations - it was over the injuries. Which were never proven. We had several players suspended for a year, Coach Payton suspended for the year, our GM Mickey Loomis suspended for 8 games, and ou assistant coach Joe Vitt suspended for 4 games. We also lost two 2nd Round draft picks, and were fined $500k.  Paul Tagliabue was later brought in and voided the player suspensions. Goodell also said that if the Saints cooperated, and helped the league start several safety initiatives in high schools, we would get our 2013 2nd Round pick back. Benson never spoke out against Goodell, and was entirely cooperative with anything he wanted. We never got our 2nd Round pick back.  Many people will claim there is proof of a $10k bounty on Favre from Vilma, or that it wasnt from Vilma, but actually from Mike Orenstein (who was in jail at the time and couldnt have actually sent anyone anything). There's never been any proof of these things - these all come from just one source, Mike Cerullo, who had actually been fired from the Saints for several reasons and had to be escorted from the facility by the police. Seeing as how he's the only "witness" Goodell ever had, it's pretty easy to call into question his reputation.  We were pretty much victims of trumped up charges that a lazy media did nothing to refute.
I’ve seen a few saints falcons flairs around and they make me twitch in weird ways
[Might be this one?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8GCH5qf9IY)
The Flames believed in a young kid from Mobile and the rest is history
Matt Ryan was really good for a long time. It sucks that he will always have 28-3 attached to his name when he had an excellent career 99% of QBs would be envious of
I’ll admit I wasn’t old enough to watch Vick all that much when he was a Falcon (I only really watched him when he played the against the Redskins and when he would lose to the Eagles in the playoffs), but I can’t help but find it ridiculous how there are people who swear up and down that Vick was a better QB than Ryan and won’t hear any argument otherwise.
He ain’t no Flutie.
Mf goes into fetal position whenever Brady is on TV lmaooo
Really though, life must be good if that’s something you worry about.
The Nick Foles Superbowl run reads like a cheesy movie script. Your  season MVP candidate quarterback goes down in December, and a career backup not only gets them to the Superbowl, but wins MVP. That's some real Mighty Ducks shit
Four Hall-Of-Famers on that team. They were a consistent top 5 defensive unit for 7 or 8 seasons.
Your franchise has had more success in the last twenty years than any other has had in any human lifetime. If you can't be happy with that then you can fuck right off.
Difference is that 28-3 had large swaths of Falcons fans giving up even being fans of the team or of football. Nothing of that magnitude happened when the Seahawks lost. A tough loss yet (like 18-1) but it didn't decimate the fanbase.
yea not even close. thats quite literally the greatest superbowl game ever played & the fallout from that loss is still lingering today for the falcons tbh
its ok he can be both
True, though obviously you won’t find me feeling bad about 28-3.
Yeah but it could have been 7 😢    (I’m being half sarcastic, we really can’t complain at all and we’re making up for it by being hella mid, if not garbage now)
Haha, if I pictured myself as a Steelers fan, I'm sure it was a classic. Painful, though.
Not gonna disagree, I see him as more of a waterfall than a rapid myself (they edited it, wrote rapid first), but I was moreso just making the point of “Don’t poke the bear”. It was really a team effort by all of Cincinnati to lose that game. Fans, Hill, Burfict, Pacman, throw Marvin Lewis in there as well for never being able to control his team
Ah yes, the “Ryan Shazier was celebrating with his teammates the fact that he gave Giovanni Bernard head trauma and not the fact that he just caused a huge turnover in a division rivalry playoff game, that evil, evil man” argument   I’ve been down this road before, next part is you telling me that Ryan Shazier deserved to be paralyzed from the waist down for the rest of his life because of his poor tackling form. Go ahead, the floor is yours.
I think it’s one of those games where a few decisions make a huge change. They got a touchdown on a close call, we got one taken away by a weak PI, my all time fav bad call where Hasselback is called for chop block when he tried to tackle a guy, and then there was another weak holding call. Big Ben threw two picks. Whatever. Not mad lol
The Kentucky Gentleman reboot got me through college. Or so I've heard
Factory reset
I have a pretty good temperament and don't get legitimately mad about sports often.  I was furious after that game. Maddest I'd been since the 10 second run off
Wow you really proved a point lol
tl:dr keep coping https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhnn9kbqQUA&ab_channel=SeanPamphilon
Lol i think the girl in the back musta been a bruins fan, she seemed very happy when it got tied up
Honestly if they won that SB he’d for sure be in the conversation for HOF
Yep. He even had the 4th highest passer rating in Super Bowl history, but as you said that loss will always be attached to his name, even though he had little to do with it
Even though it was an incredible and hilarious way to win a playoff game against one of our hated rivals, it was still bittersweet because we knew AB would most likely miss the next playoff game, and we were already down Leveon + hobbled Ben (but what else is new lol)
Agreed, but don’t forget the massive contributions from the refs as well.
Oh, you're one of those types who wants to make up arguments to fight against. Have a good day man.
Ratio
Coping about what? The superbowl we won and you didn’t?
He probably should be in the conversation anyway. He and Rivers had a very similar career with Ryan having an MVP and Super Bowl appearance on his resume. I personally don't think either should be in, but if Rivers is in the discussion I think Ryan has to be also.
Lol, for what? Definitely not burfict’s hit, definitely not hill’s fumble, are you saying the refs favored the Steelers by not calling a penalty for Joey Porter being on the field? Assistant coaches come onto the field all the time during long stoppages of play/injury timeouts, can’t remember ever seeing a flag for it. I’d be more mad at Pacman for getting baited in and costing his team another 15.
It’s not making it up if I’ve seen multiple bengals fans expressing that very sentiment, I was just predicting where this conversation usually leads…
Man just let him be. Vikings fans are a sad, miserable bunch.
I'd put Ryan in long before Rivers. Rivers was a great Fantasy QB, but he often came up small when it matted the most. For all the "28-3", Ryan took them to the Super Bowl and played really well int that game (17/23, 284 yards and 2 TD).
Ruling Martavis Bryant’s “catch” a TD, not flagging that bald fuckhead for spearing gio giving the Steelers a free possession, porter was just as culpable as Pac-Man, and it should have been offsetting penalties.
I said none of that though, so yeah kinda projecting hard.   It's whatever, I just get annoyed seeing people act like it was only the nasty Bengals (and a nice pot shot at the fans) instead of the culmination of about 20 years of the AFCN teams absolutely brutalizing each other.
And man it’s fun to see
Everybody likes to talk about the playoff run flacco had and how it's one of the best ever for a QB but Ryan had him pretty substantially beat in nearly every statistical category. If not for 28-3 Ryan had maybe the best playoff qb run ever
Okay, that’s enough, I draw the line at anyone denigrating the [greatest butt-catch of all time](https://youtu.be/wbz0o0spEgk)   Can you point out to me in that video specifically where he loses control? Because it looks like a catch to anyone without homer-tinted glasses on
Richardson to Baltimore would be hilarious.
A lot of people wonder why certain teams schedule Top 30 visits with guys that seem out of reach or not a position of need. When McDaniels and Zeigler got to Vegas I remember one of them saying that they keep a database of all the guys they've scouted over the years and they reference their personal files on guys when looking at free agents and trade candidates. It's also an opportunity to get insight on possible future opponents. I think a handful of these visits may serve as that kind of "long play" for some teams with relative stability in their front office.
Ravens 👀
Interesting the Texans aren’t mentioned…
You won’t cowards @falcons
Why do they keep saying top 30? There's only 32 teams in the league? And it's not like this is college recruiting either it's weird jargon
why waste time visiting us?
Most of the hype around richardson is coming from his agent.  Obviously these teams are going to look at him but it's pretty unlikely he'll draft in the top 20 and maybe not even first round at all
Strange, because our RB room is full.
If we have to then I’d absolutely trade for the #3 pick and get him.
Sam Hinkie talked a lot about maintaining a decision journal - something I try to get senior leaders to do.  Too many people don’t hindsight their decisions and if the inputs were right, or they only hindsight what they “did do” and not what they didn’t. Tons of value to be had validating/refuting your own approach and you need more data to do that.   Picked up a similar story from google where they Intentionally hired people that their system wouldnt normally say to hire, and run that as a real test of if the filters were actually right
Also allows the team to sell themselves to the player and make an impression on them. If you’re not taking advantage of that, you’re just missing out
They know they are already taking Stroud
Each team gets 30 visits. It’s not in reference to the number of teams lol
Every team gets to choose 30 players to visit their facilities. Often it ends up being a few more than 30 because players from schools within a local radius dont count.    For instance Steelers can allow 30 players from any non local school, but Pitt/Penn State players dont count. And theyve already hosted Joey Porter Jr. For free
Because he wants to go #1 overall
Bet any amount of money he goes in the first
>Most of the hype around richardson is coming from his agent.  I'm sure having the highest RAS for a QB in recorded history, along with an arm that can make any throw didn't have much to do with it. Definitely the agent.
He is going in the first.
RemindMe! 19 days  u/cat_napped1 "Most of the hype around richardson is coming from his agent.  Obviously these teams are going to look at him but it's pretty unlikely he'll draft in the top 20 and maybe not even first round at all"
Boy I kind of hope that isn't true because if he drops to 22 I bet DeCosta takes him.
nah there's always some doofus team that will draft on hype just because they're surprised the player was available and so they abandon their real plan   or just out of pure idiocy. zach wilson style
He's 6'4 and runs in the 4.4s, imagine the possibilities at TE
>Sam Hinkie talked a lot about maintaining a decision journal   This is cool, going to start doing this myself
Yeah it just seems like they are going Young or Stroud which I find very telling
Then why say "Top"?
Why do they limit it to 30? If a player and a team want to meet each other who the fuck cares?
Not happening
Wilson was considered to be a top qb in his draft during the season though.
But can he block?
Hinkie is the goat - I would highly recommend reading this letter he wrote as I find it to be one of the best encapsulations of decision theory and true strategy I’ve seen   > https://www.espn.com/pdf/2016/0406/nba_hinkie_redact.pdf  Relevant portion…  > Lifelong learning is where it’s at. To walk down that path requires a deep-seated humility about a) what’s knowable, and b) what each of us know. We hire for this aggressively. We celebrate this internally. And we’ve been known to punish when we find it woefully lacking.  >We talk a great deal about being curious, not critical. About asking the question until you understand something truly. About not being afraid to ask the obvious question that everyone else seems to know the answer to. And about the willingness to say three simple words, “I don’t know.” Tesla’s Elon Musk describes his everyday stance as, “You should take the approach that you’re wrong. Your goal is to be less wrong.” The physicist James Clerk Maxwell described it as a “thoroughly conscious ignorance—the prelude to every real advance in science.” Bill James of the Boston Red Sox (and, I might add, a Kansas basketball expert) added a little flair when asked whether the learnings available via examining evidence were exhausted: “we’ve only taken a bucket of knowledge from a sea of ignorance.”  >A way to prop up this kind of humility is to keep score. Use a decision journal. Write in your own words what you think will happen and why before a decision. Refer back to it later. See if you were right, and for the right reasons (think Bill Belichick’s famous 4th down decision against Indianapolis in 2009 which summarizes to: good decision, didn’t work). Reading your own past reasoning in your own words in your own handwriting time after time causes the tides of humility to gather at your feet. I’m often in waist-deep water here.  >The other reason to keep track yourself is you’re often the only one to see the most insidious type of errors, the ones the narrative generating parts of our lizard brains storytell their way around—errors of omission. You don’t have a wobbly understanding of just the things you got wrong, but the things you got right but not right enough. Listen to Charlie Munger talk about how he and Berkshire Hathaway should be measured not by their success, but by how much more successful they would have been if they bought more of something: “We should have bought more Coke.”
They're just called "Top-30" visits. They at the very least give the illusion of a team's 30 preferred prospects (which isn't necessarily true since they could be for medical information, smokescreen, or general due diligence).
Because teams get to allocate this limited number of 30 visits across their “top” 30 players. It doesn’t mean that team’s top 30 players on their board, but they’re top 30 players that they most want to visit with.  They can get medical questions answered then and gain a feel for the player’s personality and football IQ. So since teams have to make selections in rounds 1-7, there will be players that come in on these top 30 visits that may be targets at any round—or even UDFAs.  Does that make sense?
Probably to keep prospects from having to meet with 32 teams in 32 cities over the span of a month which would be exhausting for the player and a logistical nightmare for all involved. Forcing each team to choose 30 players from the whole draft class makes it unlikely that any given player has more than 5-10 visits scheduled in the month leading up to the draft.
Most likely not, but that's the answer to why would he bother meeting with them. Because he wants to be drafted as high as possible
Nobody even knew who Zach Wilson was until he had a great year against some of the worst competition of all time during COVID when half the conferences didn't even play.  Probably the worst scouting mistake in draft history.  It's pretty obvious he's nowhere close to an NFL caliber quarterback.
Bad man can't hurt us anymore. We might have plays **designed** to go downfield this year.
Yes thank you
Which is understandable. Side note it's weird you downvoted but essentially agreed with me
I think the point was that a lot of people had him as one of the top QBs in the draft.  Not just the Jets.
No problem buddy!
I promise I did not downvote you
ok.  but the jets were the stupid ones that actually drafted him at 2.  So it doesn't matter what other people were thinking
It was downvoted so fast I assumed it was to the person I replied to my mistake
If the Jets weren’t picking #2 and another qb needy team was, that team would have drafted Wilson. He was pretty much the consensus best qb behind Lawrence
Jags fans personally contributing to the team effort.
It's nice that the NFL writers decided to give him a redemption arc
What are fans thoughts on him now? Did he do better? Did he get lucky with a bunch of players stepping up now that Meyer is gone?
Jags fans should feel lucky that the clown doesn’t have a ridiculous wingspan and a torn ACL or it would probably be on the team next year.
I swear the Afc South teams just take turns dominating the division. The past decade it started with the Colts with Luck, then Houston with Deshaun,  then the Titans with Henry, and now its the Jags turn!  Lest we not forget the Jags Sacksonville anomaly year during Houstons rein.
I actually respect this. He was clowned hard and he hit it out the park last season. Keep the receipts
But you have not yet proved them wrong… it’s a reminder that you “still have to prove them wrong”
There’s a Jags fan out there who looked Baalke in the eye and told him to resign. I like to think that fan made Trent evaluate himself and stop being such an egotistical ass hole.
There is legitimately nothing he can do to prove us Niner fans wrong though. Jacksonville Dynasty with multiple rings? Still a clown in SF. Makes the HOF as a GM? Still Bozo to Niner fans.
"And I took that personally."
One year doesn’t mean you’re suddenly a good GM. I’m happy how last year turned out but I for one am not going to crown Baalke as a quality GM yet.
One good season isn’t enough.
I hope someone prints out this thread and mails it to him
Did he forget what happened to Urban Meyer? Like are we legit ignoring that entire mess? They weren't wrong. They were right and if it weren't for them you might have stuck with that clown. I don't think I've read a single thing in my entire life that made me think Baalke is good at his job or knows what he is doing.
Most teams fans suck pretty bad so these guys deserve a laugh at their expense haha
Chip on his shoulder.
“They think I don’t know what I’m doing, but I’ll prove them wrong.  Khan, give me another sack of money!”
Anyone have that video of the girl saying fire balke on the jumbotron
Long way to go.
You are still a fucking clown.  You ain’t proving shit.
Balke gives off Matt Patricia energy
Trent Baalke is (not) All Elite
This guy is a clown. I'm happy for Jags fans because of last year's turnaround, but this guy sucks.
Fall backwards into Trevor Lawrence. Think you suddenly turned the team around on your own.
Trent Baalke refused to draft a player first overall because of his personal dislike for his college head coach
I just wanna give the guy props for engram, Kirk, jones, and then pulling out that Ridley deal.  GMs all the time try and spend in FA and get a hodge Podge of mid receivers, but Kirk played up to that contract and can be a great 2, and did fine in a pseudo 1 roll.  Engram looked really good, jones produced.  Ridley is potentially going to be a 1 with a deal that minimizes risk. Completely different than the pats going in a few years ago and getting smith, Henry, some other mid guy that was kinda uninspiring.
Man he still has a job?
Remindme! 3 years
Some things don’t necessitate sharing, Trent.
Probably from one of us
Alright. Which one of y’all sent him the clown?
Jags fans gonna troll their GM into a Super Bowl out of spite
Baalke isn't a bad GM, the problem is with the 49ers his draft picks were absurdly poor.  He did everything else wonderful for the GM position, if he had hit on his draft picks instead of whiffing he'd probably still be on the 49ers.  Considering he came from scouting the whiffs were unacceptable, but Baalke did a wonderful job accumulating draft value by trading up and down, finding some gems in FA and overall he was in the top GMs in everything...except hitting his picks.  I assume he learned his lesson and in Jacksonville he is letting the scouts do their job, so he'll be a fine GM moving forwards as long as he doesn't fall in love with players.
And the haters say fans aren’t part of the team smh
You are welcome
I wish they would write the Vikings redemption arc, they’ve been edging us for like 60 seasons now.
Any good villain arc has to have a period where we think they might turn a new leaf, before despair is dropped on them and they jump off the deep end.
I’m not crazy about the writing staff’s work since Lamar won the MVP and from Peyton losing the super bowl to the Seahawks through Brady beating the falcons… but this is one of the better ones.
He hasn't proven anything wrong or right. Just because Doug Pederson is a good coach and Trevor Lawrence is a good QB does not mean that Baalke is a good GM.
So, the 21 draft is looking like an absolute homerun, but Meyers definitely had a big hand in that. Last year's draft looks less than stellar, but it's too soon to call it. Outside of draft moves have been amazing, so I'd say he's been good but still has more to prove.
The general consensus is we're happy to have been proven wrong. Things could change quickly if we have a bad season though.
He’s terrible, I hope he goes to the beach and can’t get sand out of his hair. Like he’s showering two weeks later and finds a piece
We will see more next year, but so far decent imo. He has had a lot of good draft picks in his first 2 years. Calvin Ridley will be an important factor as well. That was a Balke deal
He literally big brained the Hutchinson pick and fucked up. Dudes an idiot
That whole debacle was Urbans doing. Most are on board with Baalke.
He’s alright.. I can say free agency he kills it, drafting I don’t know…
No, that gets you drafted by the Orlando Magic
That is literally how the NFL is designed, it’s very rare a team like New England gets a complete clown division to beat up on for 20 years
Hey man, I just want you to know we won the division TWICE before Watson with just Hoyer and Osweiller at QB. Yeah that's right we won with Brock Osweiller one year. Sure, the reason is because the division was horrible and not because the Texans had a great roster, but winning the division because everyone else sucked still counts as winning!
tbf we had it most of the last decade, schaub through watson (who only won it twice).   It's the Jags turn to have a good run for years.
What did he hit out of the park exactly? I think some of the FA signings were doubles, but the Walker pick is probably the most important decision he made last offseason and that doesn’t look like a home run so far.
Proves all the good bullying can do /s  For real /s dont take this seriously
Jags go above 0.500  Trent Baalke: "Fuckin got em"
Urban was fired by the time the clown stuff happened
I know I'm biased but most jags fans are pretty much like fuuuuckme lol we're a chill group of guys
"Fuck, which one?! I thought I fired him."
https://twitter.com/TrevorlandPod/status/1480254892455432195
Urban brought him in, not the other way around.
I'd pin Urban Meyer on Shad.
Agreed!
Honestly I’ll do anything at this point
Remindme! 5 years "Did this take age really well or really poorly?"
He was also pretty toxic though iirc, which detracts from the things he does well.   Maybe he changed, maybe not
Are we forgetting Baalke's ACL projects? We had a stacked roster because of the previous GM and he did Jack shit when he took over.
If you can't hit on draft picks, you're a bad GM. It's the most important part of the job.
At the end of his tenure in SF he conspired with the owner to fire Harbaugh and didn’t pick players to fit the scheme. He was also notorious for picking injured players that never paid off. At least when he left there were a lot of draft picks to start a rebuild. I’m glad he’s finding success now, but he had a masterclass in how to sink a successful franchise before he left.
I think you're being real generous with "He did everything else wonderful for the GM position". I think one of those things should be "Keep your HC that got you to the SB in year 2" and "Don't hire 2 one-and-done coaches that should never have been HC in the first place". Also "Don't leak shit" is a good one.     I'm not bitter, you're bitter.
I personally wouldn't call forcing out the most successful coach we had had in years over personality conflict "wonderful for the GM position"
You say this like he didn't just talk himself into taking Travon Walker over Hutchinson.
Basically from what I’ve seen he’s doing the same thing. Some of the guys have worked out but they were also guys Urban Meyer was high on so who knows if it was him or someone else. This last draft was very questionable with a lot of guys needing a lot of development to be future solid starters.
He was a terrible GM for us. Inherited a stacked team and barely added talent. He inherited t-law which will keep his job until the jags smarten up. Hopefully it’s before t-law needs to be paid
I feel like hitting on draft picks is mostly luck
He also ran harbaugh out of town. Being bad at drafting and getting rid of the best coach we’ve had since Bill Walsh puts him in the “Bad GM” category for most of us
What?? Last year he was the most hated man in this sub for a while.
Side note, I actually know him personally through family and he’s also not as bad of a dude as the media makes him out to be. He’s just abrasive which rubs certain types the wrong way.
How is Baalke a top 3 GM?
I know we have 5 rings so, it's a bit hollow, but we are the kings of edging recently. 6 NFCCG appearances since 2010 with zero rings.
It does mean they have a franchise QB though which buys him a ton of time.
So he bought in the good HC and good QB and get no credit? Okie
I just want to know where you think the rest of our team's players were signed and drafted from in the past two years? Does he not get credit for practically building the rest of the roster that Doug and the staff can work worth or because Doug is good it's just all the credit to Doug?
I mean he is the reason those two are in place  I like how all the comments are like “Lawrence was a no-brainer”  Yes  He hired Doug Peterson, who turned the previous mistake into a playoff team and got Trevor on track. They made some key signings that got them competitive.  There’s a lot to be said for a GM who is willing to make changes quickly, which he did with Urban.  He deserves credit.  I have no dog in this fight, I really don’t have much of an opinion on the Jags outside of this post. I just don’t understand the point of making it sound like the only two things he’s done are hire Pederson and draft Lawrence. He’s done a lot
They have a pretty good, complete roster
Yeah, I don't want him out like I did last year, but I'm still not sold.
But were you actually proven wrong yet? Seems too fair weather to say so
There ain’t nothing wrong with betting on the upside, and given the choice again I think we still take Travon. Watch the way he moves on the field, go look at shit like him breaking up that pass to Kelce in the AFC Divisional. The juice he’s got you just can’t teach, and that’s the kinda shit you want to bet on with a top pick.
he didn't big brain it, he just hates Jim Harbaugh so much he refused to draft a Michigan player. If anything, he small brained it
lmao
I feel like most fans were forsure calling for his neck last year.
Not really tbh, the NFL is designed to allow teams with elite QB to utterly dominate for years
Honestly the Texans did have a great roster, they just didn’t have a QB. The problem was the talent started leaving before Watson came in.
Bringing in Doug P. His free agents were great, I wouldn’t say he knocked it out of the park but even just getting Doug P is enough to say he had a pretty good year
He is a clown so that figurine is fitting. Best thing that could have happened to us was losing him and getting Lynch/Shanahan
I think the Walker pick is TBD. His whole thing is raw but crazy upside. If he figures it out, watch out, but if he fails, massive miss on Hutchinson. But we'll need time to see for sure.
Walker was seen as a bit of a project but a freak of nature athlete. He wasnt awful last year either. Need to give it a little more time
> and that doesn’t look like a home run so far.  I don't agree nor disagree. Give these guys 3 years before you make a judgment. I would simply say that the early returns on Walker haven't been great so far, and that Hutchinson is off to a more ideal start. But that could shift in both directions for either of them.
We'll have to wait and see, mainly with regard to Trayvon Walker, but he finished strong so there's reason to be optimistic with him. Devin Llyod and Chad Muma look to be good picks as well.
All of our receiving options last year were free agent signings. His drafting and free agent signs provided a foundation of players that Doug Pederson was able to work with and go from worst to first in our division.   If those playoff results aren't a home run then you've got some mighty high expectations. Walker pick was fine and  his ceiling is high but that alone shouldn't be the defining of Baalke's success or failure.
Acquiring Kirk, Engram, and (probably, we’ll see) Ridley were all good moves
And a playoff win. Literally no team had ever won a playoff game the year after earning the number 1 pick. A pretty big year-over-year improvement.
Baalke was hated in this sub last year. Everyone was commending Leftwich for only wanting the job if Baalke was gone.  Suddenly his generational 1st overall pick looks less like a bust in year 2 and he's a good GM?
Aye I’ll join you   RemindMe! 5 years
Both he and Harbaugh were toxic, but Baalke went all Wormtongue and made sure he came out on top by taking advantage of a young/naive owner.
Tell that to people who still defend Belichick the GM
Don't forget after Harbaugh left he was down on the field ["coaching"](https://www.nfl.com/news/niners-gm-trent-baalke-helping-coach-team-s-players-0ap3000000607803)
Doug Pederson was the reason the Jags did well I think. How in the hell the Eagles let him go (yes yes Philly I know you ended up with another good coach) if Tlaw keeps progressing and the Jags just stay out of their own way letting Doug do his thing you’ll be fine.
Lets not forget Doug Pederson pulling jalen hurts to give a look to our third string.  It was clear that Jalen was not the quaterback for Doug and there was a clear organizational divide.   It worked out for everyone, so no hard feelings.    Also the superbowl helps
I can understand that for Day 3 because most of the players are projects or are guys with poor physical traits who last like 2-3 years before washing out.  But Day 2 and especially Day 1 you need to get those picks right. Most of them are capable prospects and it's on you to figure out which one has the best skillset and temperament to succeed on the team.
It is. Everyone should read https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/no-team-can-beat-the-draft/.
He's absolutely not.
One good year and this guy is talking about how the Jaguars are a perfect example for the league lmao
He's not.
No doubt, but the Vikings have still lost 6 NFCCGs since our last SB appearance :(
I feel like SF doesn't get talked about as an elite team in general. I mean if you ask 10 fans which are their top 5 teams, I bet they don't list SF.... regardless of the wins.   Like I didn't know you made the NFCC 6 times in the last 12 years.. which is awesome. I only remember you made and lost 2 Superbowl.
Trevor Lawrence was one of the easiest draft picks of the last twenty years and Doug Pederson wasn't even his first choice
Didn't he also bring in Meyer though?
Wow he drafted Trevor Lawrence first overall, get this guy a raise lmao
You cannot give him credit for drafting the highest rated prospect since Andrew Luck, the worst GMs in league history would have done that  And he almost ruined him too by hiring Urban Meyer
Pederson was on a very short list of coaches who were even willing to work with him.  When the list is so small because everyone knows how toxic you are, you don't get nearly as much credit.
He kinda just got lucky with both. Trevor Lawrence was the only choice at number 1 that year. Every other GM in that position would have picked him. Byron Leftwich was their top choice for a while, but he decided to drop out, which probably saved Baalke's job.
I can see the HC pick, but TLaw pick was not a genius move now.
I watched a bunch of Jags games, Trevor was cooking. Zay Jones was honestly not that good, and Kirk was okay. Engram and Key were actual good signings I'll give him credit for that. Jenkins is a bad safety that got bailed out by well timed turnovers so casuals think he's good. Same for the other white safety (forgot his name) you guys have. Also a team usually doesn't stay that healthy in a season. That plus the Titans collapsing, that isn't happening again next year, you're gonna see that regress to the mean.                Not saying Baalke flat out sucks. But running laps over him being "good" is weird.
I feel like so. Basically all of his Fas and rookies did good work
Yes. His question was asking as of right now.
Tell that to Justin Herbert and the Chargers.
Let's not forget that Doug was the backup plan. The Jags wanted Leftwich but he refused to work with Baalke.   Which is funny that Baalkes awfulness prevented him from making a bad hire
Retreading a HC that was successful somewhere else is NFL GM’ing 101.  I’m not saying it’s a good or bad move. But it’s certainly a safe and easy move.
aka one of the few coaches who was even willing to work with him.
But wasn’t that the obvious choice?
He hired Doug *after* hiring Meyer *and* Leftwhich turning them down.  “After almost making two of the worst head coaching decisions in the NFL, he chose the veteran who won a Super Bowl and was seen as the most stable candidate in the league”
Idk man, Hutchinson immediately stepped in as an impactful player and has 99.99% athleticism. Sauce stepped in as 1st team All Pro. He overthought it.
Walker looked great to start the year and then slowed down by midseason point. If he can maintain the level of play he had early, he’ll be great.
I know, but Hutchinson is also a freak *and* had the tape and production. Just didn’t make sense to me
It’s not just about Hutchinson. Sauce was also there and stepped in as 1st team All Pro. Or trade back and acquire more capital.
Lloyd looked great for like 3 weeks and then lost for the rest of the year. You never want to see your first round LB benched for large stretches at the end of the season.
Yes I agree, I’m not writing him off as a productive player, but it’ll be hard to imagine he surpasses Hutchinson or Sauce based off this year. You never know though.
But those receivers weren’t home runs, they were solid doubles. Kirk was good, but still paid very, very handsomely when they probably could’ve paid less or got Amari Cooper for a 5th.
Yeah sure but that's not as funny so I chose to omit it
91 cowboys and 78 oilers have picked 1st overall and won a playoff game
not to disrespectful but after picking back to back number 1 pick overall team should improve somehow.. you cant go anywhere but upwards.
He also torpedoed the Harbaugh situation and destroyed what the early 2010s 9ers built
I was willing but not able to do a backflip when the Jags passed on Hutch but from what I understand and seen in our head to head Walker is a solid player and only getting better. Definitely not a bust, it was expected that he’d have a slower start than the other top edges
I'm less angry at him this year than last year.
I mean… if you’re most important pick goes from looking like a bust to looking like a plausible franchise QB you should be viewed differently as a GM
Walker is a bust already?! And one pick is enough to judge a gm?!  Edit: I'm dumb
Walker is mid too
I would join you both, but I’m hopeful that Baalke will be gone sometime in the next 5 years
Baalke, Harbaugh and York were all so toxic with each other back then...considering how much they've all grown as people I'm curious if that'd happen again if the three were all together again today
I seem to remember a story from someone (Kawakami?) where York wanted to sit in on a meeting, harbaugh told the owner the meeting was for "men only" and shut the door in his boss's face.  Obviously Baalke survived longer than Harbaugh, but considering how Harbaugh interacted with his boss, why do people think Baalke got him fired?
Has he had any major whiffs? I know people jump on him for like the Strange pick last year but didn’t that guy start every game and play pretty well? I guess he isn’t always drafting all star pro bowl top of the league guys but the pats haven’t exactly bottomed out either.
As a GM how many super bowls does he have? Because he gets his coach guys who can be coached hard and bye into what his coaches are selling. And he's always picking near the very end of the draft for 20 years. Meanwhile, my team and half a dozen others are picking the best talent, year after year. Scratch that, other teams are picking the best talent year after year.
I feel like if enough research or effort could guarantee a result then there wouldn't be any missed picks. These teams are pouring millions of dollars into scouting each draft.  At the end of the day there's just too many variables that go into a human being good at football. It's impossible to predict with certainty so it's mostly luck imo.
Thanks for the support. I was eating downvotes before you guys showed up.
Honestly, I would rather miss the playoffs than go that far and lose. Hurts too much.  Edit: sorry for my opinion I guess. My bad for enjoying no pressure games in lost seasons more than devastating losses.
What’s an NFCCG………
We've had some absolutely terrible years thrown in. We're either really bad or go to the NFCCG. 6 appearances in that game and only 6 playoff appearances lol. Also, east coast and LA bias is real. And we haven't had a pro bowler/all pro under center since Garcia. Even when Kaep was lighting up the league he didn't get one. Media coverage tends to fawn over those teams that have big time quarterbacks.
He also signed a bunch of effective players, got rid of others, moved on from Urban and hired Pederson. All of that got them to win a playoff game.   I don’t get this comment chain, it doesn’t make any sense, his career in Jacksonville is more than two things  Didn’t most of the 2022 FA signings end up being pretty good? I know Kirk and Ingram were really good. Why we ignoring everything else he’s done?  Never thought I’d be deep in a comment section defending… Trent Baalke
Who was his first choice? My understanding is that Khan did the hiring. The only other candidate that I recall that had any interest at the level of Doug was Leftwich, but he wanted to bring his own guy in as GM.
No. Shad’s move. But, that said I’m still not sold on Baalke as a GM.
Meyer specifically wanted Baalke
Didn’t he drafted the best Quarterback in their franchise history?
Urban Meyer was not Baalke's hire. It was our owner's decision.
And how did they get the highest rated prospect since Luck? By tanking.  Believe it or not, nfl tank on purpose
He set the team to draft Lawrence.
Lol Jenkins isn’t a pro bowl level safety, but this is laughable. Dude put together some of his best games as a pro last year.
A safety got bailed out by turnovers he helped create? I have no clue how you judge talent but this is some disingenuous analysis already. And then you go on a tangent about the team being lucky healthy and that should be a criticism against Baalke. Our offensive line wasn't healthy for the whole year but they somehow held up with the backups we had and put into place.
You just delete this bro
Or y'know, the NFC South minus the Bucs during the 2010s
Mahomes lul
I like to imagine that Baalke was intentionally over the top insufferable during the entire interview process to ensure this result.
So easy the Bears can do… oh.
They also kinda fell ass-backwards into it. Byron Leftwich was almost the pick and that would have probably not turned out as well.
No, the team wanted Leftwich but Khan refused to part with Baalke to make it happen. Doug was our second choice.
He actually got better towards the end of the season. He did lull in the middle when he was dealing with an injury. Not sure how bad it was
The trade back likely wasn’t on the table given the QB class.
In hindsight, Sauce is the right pick. But who picks a CB at 1?
How do you know we could have paid less? Just your own assumption? Kirk's production last year was a career best for him and also top ten overall for receivers. His cap hit for last year was barely top 20. So his production out paced his deal.   Same thing for Zay Jones and Evan Engram having career years; all helped Trevor progress and get us into the playoffs.
This is the exactly the kind of toxicity that I love this sub for
This is fair, also fuck off and lose every game for forever please.
But not earned, they traded for it.
I've been a Jags fan long enough to know this isn't necessarily true.
Not when every single other GM would have picked him 1st too.  He was not a bad GM because Lawrence struggled in year one, but he's also not a good GM just because he played better this year
Literally you didn’t understand what they said
I still don’t trust him and Khan. Hopefully they can keep the ship upright this time. You Jags fans deserve it.
The Jed York redemption arc has been pretty incredible. I can't believe how far he's come as an owner. I went from hating him to really appreciating his stewardship.
because too many 49er fans don't (still) don't want to believe anything bad about Harbaugh.
That was after the writing was already on the wall and he was on his way out because Baalke was a piece of shit.  If you knew you were already being ousted and there was nothing left to salvage from the situation, you wouldn't tell your shithead boss to fuck off?
The only picks I would consider whiffs in the past 5 years is N'Keal and the assortment of 2nd round DB (aside from Dugger). Guys like Isaiah Wynn and Sony weren't great but at least they were starters for most of their time here.
https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/nwe/draft.htm  2017-2019 would get most GMs fired
I think the hit rate on first rounders is right around 50%. It's not an exact science by any means. Some positions are easier than others. For example, PFF has proven it's possible to significantly increase your hit rate on edge rushers. Meanwhile, CBs are still pretty hard to get right, and nobody's even come close to figuring out QBs.  The Eagles are an example of a franchise that does basically everything right from a process standpoint, and they still missed on a ton of picks before the last few years. Jalen Reagor being the one that looks the absolute worst in hindsight. Just had a run of bad luck that turned around. Seattle just had an amazing rookie class, but if you look at their drafts between the Legion of Boom era and now they had plenty of bad picks too.
You can't be perfect, but you can certainly improve your odds. You're just playing percentages and hoping for the best. But saying it's all luck is reductive imo
Opinions can be shitty.   What you're saying is akin to a millionaire telling people on welfare that having money is actually a bad thing and that you'd rather be poor.
You just said this on a post about the Jaguars who had a decade long stretch of no post season and multiple seasons of 4 wins or less. Lmao
Loser mentality tbh
I mean Jimmy G never got credit for the wins because he was so frustrating to watch.
Baalke was already in the organization as Director of Player Personnel. Still, it was obviously Shad's decision to hire Urban.
Then followed up by one of the worst NFL Head coach hires arguably of all time.  I’m not a Baalke hater like most of the fanbase, but let’s not act like any GM with an IQ above forest gump would not also have selected Trevor Lawrence.
Legit anyone would have drafted Trevor Lawrence even I could have done if I had the first overall pick
Really not hard when you have the number one overall pick with the clear cut best qb on the board. Also that qb was considered a generational talent I would not give him credit for that lol
😕 Come on now
Not like in the way you're implying.
They got the first overall pick two years in a row. Did they also tank on purpose to get Travon Walker?
"He's actually great because he made the team suck!"
Frank Gore single handily did that.
“Find a new slant”
Yep, all speculation. If they could have traded back it likely wouldn’t have been for much.
You’re right, just speculation based on the market and reactions.  I’m not saying they were bad moves. They were good! But a home run for Kirk, Zay Jones, and Engram? Not sure. A home run is drafting Purdy or signing a guy who really supersedes his value for a long contract.
Didn't you guys just trade for Ridley...?
Oh, you're right.  Lol 😂
Gross
Oh fuck a Total Annihilation username?? Hello fellow 1997 RTS enjoyer
He became an absolute shithead. But I think he's alright. For now.
Yeah I was definitely a huge Jed hater around the harbaugh days and stand by that, but gotta give him credit for having the humility to step back and let the football guys do the football things. Not a common thing among people like York.
That's what I thought.
Didn’t they win a superbowl in that stretch? Idk if you realize this but usually winning the league like that means you keep your job. Anyway you’re correct in that there isn’t a lot of top tier picks in those years. Especially early but they still had some finds and as mentioned managed to win a superbowl anyway during that stretch.
Honestly, I'm not convinced drafting well is much more than luck.  People who are in the position to do it for a long time, like say a decade or more, all can go through stretches where they are seen as great drafters or shit drafters.
Yeah 50% sounds about right. Basically a coin flip.
Playing percentages and hoping for the best is just another way of saying guessing. Guessing requires luck. We could settle on calling it an educated guess if you want. That's probably closer to the truth.
But it’s football, you can turn it off
Lol no it's not. The stakes are nowhere near that high. Maybe it's just me but it's far better for my mental health to have a bad season that ends with just looking forward to the offseason and how we might improve versus losing all our quarterbacks in the NFCCG, being robbed of the chance to even compete due to circumstances, and having to think about it all offseason until opening kick.
I'm only in this thread to shit on Baalke brother. I don't know what to tell you. The end of season and offseasons after the 2018 and 2020 sub-.500 seasons were much more enjoyable for me than the ones we went to the NFCCG. I'd much rather experience those than a devastating loss that I have to think about for the next 7 months. You all are free to have your own opinions. It's just dumb to get pissy with me for having a different one.
Surely a loser mentality is lining up Ezekiel Elliott alone at center with the game on the line
~~frustrating~~   Handsome. You mean handsome
Yeah, this is like when Andrew Luck was drafted and people were like, "the Colts nailed the draft." Anyone with a brain would have made these selections. It's like choosing to eat food when you're starving. Of fucking course they did.
Lions tried to tank by trading Stafford but there was no good QB so we went with Sewell
How else you draft luck or Lawrence or joe
So you’re saying it’s not as easy as it sounds?
I’d say swapping a bottom three receiver room for a top ten one in a single season, potentially even higher with the additional of Ridley, is a about a home run.
I spent hours and hours setting up impenetrable defenses in skirmish mode and then just blind firing artillery. What a game man.
Most GMs don't have Tom Brady
I'm just against saying it's all luck. Like poker requires luck but good poker players come out on top over a long enough sample
It's a have telling the have nots that they don't want what they have.   It's stupid and you were appropriately down voted for it being stupid.
If the Lions tried to tank they did a pretty shit job of it by winning games. Teams in the NFL simply do not do what you're implying.
Trade a shit ton
The retread winning isn't the easy part they were talking about. The easy part was actually hiring the retread. Balked didn't have to work that hard in making a hire because he just went with the classic rehire of someone who had been successful somewhere else. Like Washington hiring Ron Rovera, Buccaneers hiring Arians, or cowboys hiring McCarthy.
Was playing LAN with my friends, dude hosting suggests we queue up construction then leave it running while we go eat breakfast.... come back and 90% of my shit is wrecked by the big berthas + long range radar he set up. Had to admire the finesse lmao
Most GMs aren’t Bill Belichick
Exactly and in the draft nobody is a consistent performer over a long enough sample. Even Ozzie Newsome had some stinkers.  It's not all luck but it sure takes a lot of luck. I think the skill aspect is in understanding your roster's needs and how different skill sets can fill them. Also making good trades takes a lot of skill. Perhaps you could even consider being diligent and scouting little known resources like the Patriots do as a skill.   I think those are the areas a good GM will utilize to get an advantage. When it comes to predicting when an individual player is going to be a success nobody knows. If it wasn't a guess then there wouldn't be any busts in the first round.
I didn't tell anyone what they should want. I told them what my experience was. Fucking hell what an asinine thing to argue about.
2nd overall pick  2nd worst team?  Yeah we tanked.  The GM and owners literally tried to tank but the coach said nah
5 first rounders?
It’s not any easier hiring a retread than “young up and coming coordinator”. The fact is that hiring a coach that will successful is always difficult so discounting Baalke hiring a coach that’s been successful so far just because he was a retread doesn’t make sense.
So why didn’t all the other teams with openings hire him? If it was so easy, why doesn’t every team without a good head coach do it? Hell, Pederson took a whole year off from coaching. If it was such an obvious choice, there’s tons of teams that could’ve thrown money at him to get him.  He wasn’t even the first choice ownership brought in. Baalke literally had to fight his own owner to get Pederson hired. I’m not sure why you’re pretending like Baalke should get no props for hiring Pederson but should be criticized for everything else. I don’t know that he’s a good GM but it’s not hard to accept that this was a good move and not downplay it for no reason.
It’s also important to keep in mind that at the time; Leftwich was a very seriously considered candidate that if he would have worked with Baalke, probably would have got the head coach job. Pederson was almost an “after thought” or secondary candidate. At least in the way it was being reported. Imagine the dumpster fire the Jags would still be if not for lucking out on Pederson. Or more so lucking out on Leftwichs unwillingness to work with Baalke.
Lmao what a genius bastard
Most GM's don't have BB to cover their talent deficiencies
Cardinal’s tanked last year so obviously. Last 5 games they didn’t even look like a nfl team.
The 49ers would. The Rams would.
From how it was reported pederson was the first choice before urban but took a year off then it flipped to Leftwich so Baalke being difficult to work with somehow benefited him this time lol
Right attitude to have from a player. Careers are short and you have to perform all the time.  If the team wanted to tank, thats on the coaches
They fucked up telling Lovie before the game he was not going to be kept the next. He had zero reason to help them out by losing lol
Respect to Lovie. Fuck the 1st pick, we’re winning baby.   The moment that ball went through the DBs fingers, they were winning this game. Could not believe how bad the DB misjudged the ball lmao
You play. To win. The game.
Any given Sunday some shit is going down.  That is why the NFL is great.  Regular season games matter.
He's got a point.  Even if the season is lost, every play is a new audition for whatever is next.
About 50% of NBA teams disagree for the last month or 2.
Fans get mad at teams when they win and hurt their draft stock. Players don’t give a shit about draft position. Many won’t be on the team next year and others are in contract years
This could be his backhanded way of saying he was ‘winning’ by fucking them over for the 1.01
God bless you Brandin Cooks.
He quit on the Texans mid season and got his Captain patch removed, fuck Cooks.  I’m good with Lovie though, he got Easterby fired. I’ll trade the 1st pick for that and the 2nd pick any day.  EDIT: And Cooks LOVED Easterby, fuck ‘em both!!
If they really wanted to lose they should have traded him when he asked. And Brandin took that personally
Herm Edwards has entered the chat:
I keep telling people coaches and players hate the idea of tanking especially in football…it’s the front offices that do it and a lot of the time it doesn’t even work.
bs the coach won that game as a good bye fuck you to the franchise
No player is going to tank when their job is on the line
Bless you Houston
Where was that attitude the rest of the fucking season
Calvin Ridley nods in approval
Love this attitude and love that we got him this year. Hope he thrives.
Shout out to the Eagles for throwing that game a few years ago at the end of the 2020 season. Played a big part in the rebuild to where we are now.
They cut off the last part  >"You never suit up to lose unless you suit up in a Texans uniform"
I mean, let's be real. Not even the #1 would help out the Texans...
the team is just good at losing naturally
Anyone relying on their next contract will never purposely lose
Tanking should never be a player and coaching thing. It should only be something a front office does.
Colts dbs were paid off to tank
1st overall is overrated when you have the #2 overall honestly, you can settle for second best
A HC and a player should never willingly tank.   Gms and owners probably want it, but the coach and player should not allow it
on the one hand, it could turn out like when the Giants lost out on Chase Young and had to “settle” for Andrew Thomas who is now a top-2 LT in the league OR it could turn out like the Jets missing out on TLaw which has absolutely fucked them. it’s all a crapshoot
Fuck the proccess
Maybe the Colts were tanking to prevent a division rival from having the #1 pick, while also moving from #6 to #4.
[You play to win the game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7fEjrqabg)  Not-so-fun fact: that was more than 20 years ago
it's not in the player's interest to tank. they can hire a new coach/GM who might then cut you, then you are going to be that guy in free agency that came from a bad team and you better have decent tape.
this is why the coach / GM should sit good players in those games. needed to fire lovie before the season ended. players and HCs wont throw games
Tell that to the Eagles
Chances of picking a QB in the first round is barely a 50/50 proposition of hitting or not, just do what the cards give you.
Tanking is disgraceful, and I hate to see it in any sport.  You play to win the game, not to lose.
I'm tired of hearing about how big of a deal not having the number 1 pick is when none of these QBs are can't miss prospects. If there was actually a solidified generational talent available I would understand the fixation on this story, but seriously, why is this even a story still at this point? Yes the Texans suck and it would be a cunning move by Lovie if Elway was sitting there at 1, but that's not the case so why are we obsessed with this story still?
Players are there to get paid, not help the team win. Playing well helps the teams chances but they aren't out there to make sure the draft pick the following year is as good as possible.
Wish the Bears had the same mentality
Players hoping they can play next year are not going to cave for the front office lmao
players don't care about tanking they care about their careers which they should because they get paid based off past production
I went to this game and it was a good game. Glad the Colts ate that L though!
One of the most underrated WRs out there imo, guy doesn’t get the recognition he’s earned
Why the fuck would players ever care about draft position? The only people who would EVER benefit from a loss like that are a coach and/or GM that know they will be back the next year
players dont tank organizations do
Isn’t it widely believed that Lovie knew he was getting fired and tried to win the game as a fuck you to ownership or was that just a meme?
I don’t think Coaches want to tank either because they also have jobs on the line. Tanking is a front office thing
I would agree.  My problem is he didn’t show up to play at all in other games this season
This is a guy who quit on the team midseason because Jack Easterby got fired. Gave no effort all season, so he can get fucked.
Coaches look really good when a team does badly.
He knew what he signed up for. He signed an extension with a team that was obviously rebuilding/tanking and expected a different result? Not to mention the other 16 games he played like shit. It’s fair to not want to put bad film out there and not suiting up to win yadda yadda, but you can’t whine about it when you knew what you were getting into and then play like a sentient human for one game just to spite the org. It’s just complete lack of self awareness on his end. Good riddance.
Didn't stop him from quitting on the team a few games into the season and coasting the whole year until then.
He literally said he wasn’t trying until week 18 if you actually look into this situation. The dude just hated the Texans that much.
It would be the right attitude but he dogged it all season bc he was unhappy with the team. It’s a great sentiment for sure, but this was def not his attitude all season
Love Smith legend status for that win.  And to help his old team the Bears out.  Bear Down for Midterms!
Not even the coaches, the FO
It's the right attitude for coaches and executives too. Careers are short and you have to perform all the time.
Tanking is ridiculous because it is such a crapshoot on players just health wise alone.  Build a winning culture and build up a good team in ways besides players such as getting a good S&C staff and a great medical team in house.
Yeah, tanking helps the organization but it's never good for players.
he knew he was a dead man walking; dude never listened to any of his coaches or players for input and never embraced analytics
100%.  Caserio and the FO effectively pitted themselves against the coaches unlike say Chicago. Caserio should have inactivated Cooks, Mills (already splitting duty for a while before that), and Tunsil. All because the win was not what they needed, but also because Tunsil is part of the future, no need to get him hurt. Cooks was going to be traded, no need to risk injury. A loss gives us 1, and also moves the Colts from 4 to 7, also important.   A massive L for Caserio.
One of the prettiest and most satisfying moments in NFL history. If you were going to fire him after one season with that abortion of a roster, why hire him to begin with? Just desserts.
Why would a coach willingly tank. Gm I understand, but as a coach that shit makes you look stupid
I love how people keep repeating false shit on this sub all the time lmao. They didn't' tell him before the game he was getting fired.
I think it was pretty awesome of them to let lovie know.
Not that big of a fuck up but a good fuck you. They get Bryce Young or CJ Stroud and I doubt they would have traded out of one.
HELLO
This is why I was laughing last year in Week 18 when Seattle fans were screeching "NOOOO you can't put the Lions-Packers game on SNF, that means the Lions won't try to win if they're knocked out of the playoffs before kickoff noooo!" Lmao as if the Lions wouldn't be fired up to a) beat a hated divisional rival b) at Lambeau Field c) to keep Green Bay out of the playoffs d) in front of a national audience e) and get themselves a winning record. It was a pathetic display by a big chunk of the Seattle fanbase who legitimately thought the Dan Campbell-led Lions would roll over and play dead in that scenario. Players want to win games -- shocking, I know.
I wish
Sigh I wish the NBA was still like that
The idea that highly paid coaches or players would purposely put out bad tape to help organizations that have zero loyalty to them, is just the craziest logic, but logic goes out the window when fans want a new toy.  Oh and bad teams still have to sell tickets, purposely losing can cost a lot more than that sweet draft pick.
Probably should've thought of that when he phoned in games and acted whiny after the Texans fired Jack Easterby.
Mavs deactivated half their team today when they're fighting for a playoff spot with 3 games left to go.
The players don't.
Not me. Tbh im glad the players still wanted to go out and get a win. I was alright with cj or Stroud as our QB. Our QB coach is familiar with both when he coached them at the elite 11 QB camp
To me you can be disappointed in the outcome, but how the hell do people get mad at guys that want to win? Even if it gets you a better pick I don’t get how you can actively root for your team to lose and expect the players to be ok with wanting to lose as well.
Nah fuck losing.  Tanking is ontologically evil.
The thing is why would the players want to give their team better positioning to replace them
He quit on the team tanking?
It was pretty obvious they told him he would be traded at the deadline and when that didn’t happen he was pissed. He was basically benched, he didn’t quit.
wasnt like his whole reason coming to Houston was to find a home because he was tired of being traded every year? and the front office said they wouldn’t trade him and then decided to shop him at the deadline and let every media outlet know. so he was told not to practice that week because it looked like he was gonna be moved, but then it fell through the cracks? If im wrong, let me know.
One of my favorite quotes of any kind
He quit on the team when he wasn't traded and sat out the next game. He's talking out of his ass. Talking about if someone approached him to sit the last game out, it wouldve been fight to keep him from playing. Glad he got traded
You haven’t been paying attention to the Texans. Hell, I bet a year from today they will be in a better position than your very own Pats.
GMs shouldn’t get it either
Getting traded by 4 different teams isn't recognition /s
this dude is a fucking diva. theres a reason he's been on 4 different teams.
Thats what we all assume, but lets not forget Mills pulled a pretty impressive throw out his ass steal that win.
It’s widely believed that Lovie was hired and handed a bag of shit with the expectation he had little chance of being the coach more then one year anyway.   He took the cash, did his job and handed them back a bag of shit on the way out the door.   Praise Lovie.
People acting like the Jeff Saturday Colts were somehow a good team LMFAO.
A coach on the hotseat is probably worried just as much about his resume for "the next job". I bet screwing over management with a lower draft pick wasn't the primary reason here, but who knows haha
It was pretty obvious he was going to get fired no matter the outcome. If you're lovie why would you try to lose? It has all the downside and no benefits
What makes me not like that is he really did go for broke for that win. Multiple 4th down attempts. Lots of high risk high reward stuff. Thing is…why save that for the last game. It makes the other vanilla gameplans look worse and just solidifies that he deserved to be fired. Cooks also asked not to be traded, was given an extension, and the proceeded to whine and bitch and phone in games up until the very last one. I for one am very happy to see both of them go.
He was probably trying to win every game. Texans are just really bad and then they happened to get another horrible team at the end of the year.
I think it's more meme than anything. Yes, I'm sure Lovie knew it was his last game. But I don't actually believe he tried any harder to win the last game than any other game that season. He almost definitely knew he wasn't going to last more than 1 season from the day he was hired. He was pretty obviously a placeholder. You have to remember, it was the Jeff Saturday Colts they beat. Not really a big feat, even for those Texans. And it really came down to one crazy throw at the end of the game. You can't really coach that. If anything, I think Mills played harder that game because he knew the Texans will be drafting a new QB and it was his last game as a starter.
Definitely not widely believed. I think if that actually came out from reporters it could hurt his reputation as a coach.
Contrary to other games when he was trying to lose??  Of course he was trying to win the game, that’s his job
People love to meme about it but, i mean, take a look at the situation...  Lovie was brought in as a bridge HC, and I think pretty much everyone knew that, including Lovie. They didn't seem to land the coaches they wanted to, weren't an attractive landing spot without the cornerstones of a franchise in place, and weren't expected to win. If they performed poorly (and why wouldn't they) then they get a high draft pick, a possible franchise QB, and they'll get a new HC to go with them.  Coaches have to get the most out of their players, they preach playing until the whistle, giving your all for the team, having each player do their part for the team, etc... How does a coach actively tanking look to those players? Probably pretty shitty and hypocritical. That's why I don't buy Lovie winning to spite the front office, I think he won _for his players_.  Lovie seems like a players coach. Players play for him, and they play _hard_. From CHI to UofC Champaign and even this shitty Texans team, he knows how to connect with the players. If you've been on a shit team for 17 weeks, had players on your own team quit on you, and you're finally in a position to end the year on a good note? Yeah Lovie isn't going to throw all of that away so that he makes his boss happy. He's going to do everything he can to get that W.
But it shouldn't be.  Lovie Smith has been a football coach for more than 40 years.  To expect him to ever go into a game not planning to win is disrespectful to him and his career.
Didn't they literally tell him he wasn't coming back?
I highly doubt there were any games all year he *tried* to lose
widely believed on /r/nfl so almost certainly not true
Literally just a reddit narrative. I'm sure he was there to win, just like he was every other week.
It’s stupidly believed. He probably enjoyed the win more but he tried to win all of the games
Imagine how good they would have been if he tried to win all 17!
I really struggle to believe any NFL coach would ever not try to win. Even a guy like Kingsbury who got a massive extension despite sucking was still trying to win, and he's beyond set for life now.
Makes sense. Lovie knew he was getting canned, and Mills probably knew his replacement is being drafted this year. Tanking isn’t much of a thing in the nfl
Which is why tanking isn’t actually a thing once the roster is set. The GM might put the roster in a weak spot with pressure from ownership, but they also have jobs on the line so they have to trust their owner. Once the season starts every one who actually has an impact wants to win right til the end.  Fans getting mad at players and coaches for winning late season have the smoothest of brains.
Nah Flus was 100% trying to lose us games too
and sometimes literally didn't show up to play.
You got some evidence or just hearsay.  He helped win the season finale so that would indicate you are talking out of your ass.
The tank was multiple years tho. They tanked two years ago with Culley and again with Lovie. I'll always side with the players over billionaires.
None of that shit matters. The most important thing they needed to do was get a good head coach and a good staff. The first pick means nothing if you don't have a good coach. Just ask the Jags.  Besides it was the Jeff Saturday Colts, they very well could have lost to the Texans even without Mills or Cooks out there.
Bridge coach, same thing as a bridge QB. He was hired to get paid, take some criticism and get fired.
The talent in the team was bad, but his coaching made it worse.
Just to say they hired a black  coach
It wasn’t official but it was widely reported before the game started, ESPN notification and all. I remember specifically because I thought “well, no reason for him to help them out now”
There’s no way he didn’t know or have a thought about it. It was a boss move to go for two after that last TD to seal the win.
It was being reported all over twitter before the game started. There’s no way he didn’t hear something.
Beautifully put. That was such a glorious win for the Lions, and to a lesser extent the NFC North
I find it's usually people who've never played before.   The vast majority of players PLAY TO WIN THE GAME^(TM) and also are playing for their careers and livelivhood
It was still dumb, games that affect each other should be played at the same time, if nothing but for drama and tradition.
And what an entertaining game that was
Seriously. Either one or both of them could be great or could bust. The value of 1 vs 2 is overblown, especially this year.
I'm not okay with my the players on Pats giving up, but I was definitely rooting for them to lose at the end of the season. I was worried that they'd make a late season push and keep Patricia.
He chose to be on the team knowing full well the talent void. He spoke highly of Lovie, Easterby, etc until it didn’t suit him anymore and now he wants to claim the moral high ground. On top of that, NFL teams don’t fucking tank. That’s literally what this Cooks quote is about, players play to *win*.
[removed]
He openly called for a trade after we extended him because the team was bad, and he started to decline on top of it. Then we got rid of Easterby and cooks checked out completely.
He asked for a trade so yes, you're wrong.
it's hilarious when teams trade players the fans are like "well that's just business" but then players want trades fans are like "how can you just abandon this team??"
I haven't. You might be right. I don't follow them at all, so I wouldn't really know. Though I think there are some resident losers in NFL and I think Texans is one of them.
The colts also forgot how to play defense
Lovie gets to much credit. The game was probably his last time starting a game in the NFL. Why would he go out there to lose? Mills and the players deserve the credit.
If the Colts were really trying to tank that game, they wouldn't have waited until a 4th and forever last second TD.
And all of Chicago loves him for it.
I know most hate gambling on this sub, but that throw won me a large parlay. I was so sure that I was fucked..: but you can NEVER count out Dewey “Long Neck” Mills.
2 4th down Hail Mary completions in the same drive. Insane
Wanna draft my replacement? Well fuck you
That’s the part that makes the least sense about the Texans’ whole head coaching sequence.   They fire BoB 4 weeks into the season in 2020. This gives them more time than any other team to find a new head coach. Somehow, they fail to find one, say that everything is in flux, and they hire a coach who pretty much everyone says is an interim coach (not to be confused with the actual interim coach who was the coach for most of the previous season; this guy is a *better* interim coach).   The team looks bad, they fire him, time to hire a “real” coach. Except, their big hire is the defensive coordinator of the really bad team from the year before! He’s basically a third straight interim coach. So they fire him and everyone says “he’s just a short term guy anyway”.   The Texas went 46 straight games without an actual head coach who they planned on keeping. That’s astonishing.
You say that but his team looked worse than the wholly unqualified guy that came before him. He took shit and somehow made it even worse shit.
We were at least better than the raiders LOL. And then the following week to almost beat the Eagles. The hype was there. Granted very little of that can be accredited to Saturday but still.
For the amount of credit Lovie Smith gets for beating one of the worst teams in the league, he should've screwed over management the other 13 times they lost.
Better try to win  Didn’t Doug Pederson rest starters in the second half of a game he lost to Washington in 2020, and was fired on the next day?
Not in Chicago
It could hurt his reputation as a coach because he tried to win?
Yup, being on a shitty team sucks. We went 1-9 my sophomore year, morale was so crap that I, starting varsity LT, missed the final game of the year to go to a cousin's wedding. In South Texas.
No.
That’s what bothers me probably more than anything on this sub. I can see a fan being disappointed for losing the first pick, but when they actually start bitching and blaming someone it just blows my mind
>	Fans getting mad at players and coaches for winning late season have the smoothest of brains.   That's what I hate about r/NBA, always advocating for tanking.
Yup, and we have a defensive coordinator to prove it!
Clearly you didn't watch the fucking games, or pay attention to anything that went on outside week 18.
So you’re telling me you can look at a team that has the vast majority of its money tied up in a QB that isnt on the team anymore, a head coach that’s stuck in the Mesozoic era, and look across the field at the other side of the ball in practice, see 0 first or second round picks in the front 7- and expect anything close to a .500 season? Respectfully, that’s delusion. He knew when Lovie got the job that we were not improving significantly last season. It’s not hard to put 2 and 2 together there. He knew what the deal was and complained about it regardless
Comments like this are bizarre, OFC it matters, and that outcome has nothing to do with their ability or inability to get a good coach.
…the Jags QB was the #1 pick. Having it isn’t the only thing that matters but it definitely matters
I'll take your word for it as a fan of the team.
Who was he preceded and succeeded by?
Players don’t, coaches don’t. Front office sometimes might
He's a talented player that was pissed that management was wasting part of his career by not even trying to field a good team.
It boggles my mind you can’t see the irony in this comment
that is news to me, when did he ask to be traded? I only remember him asking to be traded to a contender after the FO had been shopping him.
before October 2022?
That’s an interesting point. I wonder if because a player serving their best interest benefits one person and therefore selfish, whereas a team serving the team’s best interests benefits a large number of people so isn’t seen as selfish.
Whats hilarious is signing an extention and saying that you're down for a rebuild, and then acting like a bitch because the team fired his judas friend that was ruining this team from the inside. FUCK COOKS
For an entire season.
It is wild to me that the Colts beat the Chiefs in week 3 last season.
Pass D, they were solid against the run all season if I remember correctly
The Colts truly are an enigma. They somehow managed to forget how to do something that they didn't even know how to do in the first place.
Yeah Mills and the players won it but Lovie also went for the 4th down when they didn’t have to lol. It was a team effort
No coach or player ever steps onto the field purposefully trying to lose. You have to do what Poles did-make the squad as crappy as possible
It makes sense with the added context Deshaun had already told Texans he wasn’t ever going to play for them again shortly after getting that first, new, contract.  And then quickly afterwards the allegations started stacking.   Also Jack Easterby was making his power moves around the same time. The whole franchise was just in disarray for those two years. And wasn’t attracting the best candidates.
You mean the season where they had games like 40-0, 31-3, 31-5, and a 31-0.   2022 had one 31-3 game, but the rest were competitive enough until the 4th quarter
Houston's defense was significantly better on a per-drive basis this past year than it was in 2021, while their offense was only *marginally* worse.
He doesn't get credit for beating them, he gets credit for not tanking.
Lurie has fired every coach immediately after having a record that bad since buying the team, and we knew they were benching players at half time days before the game
right? FOs tank. coaches *almost* never do. I say almost, because I just can't explain what Doug Pederson was doing putting in Nate Sudfeld over Hurts in the last game of 2020.  Also worth noting, Pederson was then fired 8 days later.
I know it doesn’t make intuitive sense, but a report that a coach went rogue against the owner and GM may not be seen in a positive light amongst other owners and GMs.
The upcoming year’s draft should be completely disconnected from the season. The only time it should remotely come into play is in-season trades where you’re pretty much just estimating will it be a top 5 pick, a 6-20 pick, or a 21+ pick, give or take a few spots.
It makes so much more difference in the NBA to tank anyway. A single draft pick of a superstar can increase your win total by like 20-30 games. If you trade all your good players for picks, and then pick 2-3 all star level players you can turn the team around significantly faster. Careers being longer also helps as a solid core of players make a difference for longer.
I don’t advocate for it, but I’m kind of there with the Red Wings this year. I want a better draft pick, but when I’m watching the games I want them to win lol
[removed]
Nah i think hes mostly right. A bad situation and culture can ruin almost any prospect
Yeah that’s a good example - that year the Jets were “on pace” for the #1 overall pick. They didn’t get it, missing out on getting Trevor Lawrence… and ended up with Zach Wilson.   Now, the Jets might be fine going forward. They have a good roster. But Lawrence >>>>> Wilson
Another black coach they won’t give enough time to?
Dude threw a bitch fit for a contract extension instead of playing out his final year. Claimed it was a blessing to resign with the Texans. That he really believed in Lovie Smith and Nick Caserio, then threw a bitch fit 7 months later cause he didn’t get traded before the deadline.
Bruh. You have no idea what you’re talking about.
He also signed an extension with the team, speaking plainly his intentions to be here for the rebuild. Then sat out and wanted a trade. Lovie removed his captain patch for a reason.
I mean he knew what the team was when he signed his massive extension though, so hard to have any sympathy for him. If he thought they were going to be any good, he’s a moron.
lmao right? These two things:  > he threw bitch fit because he didn’t get traded to a contender at the deadline.  and   > Then he pulls this quote “you never suit up to lose.”  Seem pretty in line with each other: he wants to win.
Bro signed an extension with us knowing the talent on the team. Cmon he knew Texans weren’t contending for shit.
Well with that logic if it's a really good player you could argue it benefits every teammate and fan of the team they are going to
Yep, you nailed it.
Except for when they played that scrub from Kansas City for some reason
Hey our defense looked almost average sometimes! We forgot to play offense most of the season
Their defense was fine honestly.
Nah our defense was good. We were in most games until the third quarter but at that point defense was gassed because the offense couldn’t even get first downs half the time  We lost a lot of close games in the fourth quarter due to that
Our defense was pretty good actually. The offense was just so unfathomably bad that they consistently put the defense in horrible positions.
The Chiefs beat themselves, we were just along for the ride
Not that wild. The chiefs are cursed against us.
Yeah I know we like to shit on Easterby, which we should btw, but I think a lot of people fail to realize how much Deshaun Watson’s situation fucked us, from him refusing to play for us to his allegations.
A loss is still a loss, if by one point or forty. Lovie’s conservativeness consistently failed to win us games
There had to be a under the table deal of “hey we’ll pay you out the some extra bonus just play the backups if you win good shit but If you lose you’re already out the door either way”   No coach coaches to lose during a game. The ego high from beating a team with your 3rd stringers is too good to pass up in the moment.
Does one extra loss really matter? Does a 3-14 team have a better "culture" than a 2-15 team?  I totally agree that culture is important, but it's incremental and more organizational as well imo.  I'm not sold on Love, but know that Green Bay has a solid culture that typically puts a good product out there.
For sure, but they are in no way mutually exclusive. No rule against losing and getting a good coach.
Lovie was always a temporary solution. Demeco seems more like a long term fit for our team
So the Texans were actively trying to win football games?
[removed]
Lol yes, yes you could!
If Mahomes regresses to that game against the ~~Texans~~ Colts, he's less impressive than his whole body of work.  Edit: got my shitty AFCS teams confused there for a hot minute
I hate the Colts more than I hate the Chargers 😭 honorary divisional rival in my book
Eagles too! The only team to hold Hurt's offense to under 20 points last season.
That flag on Jones for hurting Matt Ryans feelings didnt help matters lol
nah one loss doesn't matter that much i think i misinterpreted the conversation.
Yea that’s why they almost beat the Chiefs and Cowboys
Teams really don’t tank so I would assume so yes. The team is and was full of bubble players that could easily have their career end if they don’t perform. The coaches don’t want to lose, the players don’t want to lose. Cooks also openly said he was happy and even signed an extension full well knowing the state of the team. Seems like he can’t make up his mind and just wants to whine about stuff he was completely aware of. Good riddance.
...wasn't it the Texans that put him on the trading block midway through the season? They couldn't get a deal done and then after the season Cooks simply asked them to follow through with what they started?
Mahomes was 36/41 for 336 yds, 2 TDs, no picks against the Texans
Roughing the quarterback's ego is a serious offense.
So they were just one of the most inept teams in the league lately at doing so, which sounds like even more validation for Cooks wanting out.  I believe the players tried. The ownership of the team absolutely did not try to field a winning team this season.
Not sure if he requested to be traded first but either way he knew what he was getting himself into by signing that contract. That team has no chance to compete.  I’ll play devil’s advocate for Cooks. Frankly, it was probably smart of him to take the bag and force a trade to a contender. He was looking out for himself.  But as a fan of the Texans, it leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. I can see how it looks like for fans of other teams but for Texans fans it’s a shitty look.
Not even 3 touchdowns lmao?
Jesus, that scrub had twice as many incompletions as TDs.
still took us OT to win that game tho. weird ass game
That's awful  for Mahomes.. lol
yep, got my "Cooks on the Texans", "dude I was replying to about the Colts" all confabulated...
more than!
He gone.
Easiest cut in the world. Washed, expensive, and off the field trouble. You can be maybe one of those things but not all three
Bijan or Gibbs would be so nasty on the Bengals.
Yet he still managed to score 5 touchdowns when I went against him in fantasy
Yes, obviously the Bengals need to draft an RB. I bet they'll do it day 2.
A light box isn't an advantage when you also have light blocking lol  Stacked and light box stats need to go. What's important is who has more bodies in the box. Offense or defense.  You can face a light box of 6 defenders but if you only have 5 blockers you are in a worse spot than having 7 defenders and 7 blockers.
Anyone who watched him last year could tell his legs were mostly gone. He’s going to move into the plodder part of his career now.
Mixon was so frustrating to watch last year. Insane volume and no production. And then he has that 5 TD game.  Did anyone else in the league have a worse goal line touch to TD ratio? I swear he got stuffed 4-5 times a game
How good was perine
I saw he was in this draft while playing with PFF's mock draft, and I'm a homer here, but hear me out fellow Bengos fans:  Tank Bigsby.  One of my favorite Auburn running backs and that's a pretty damn good list when I started with Cadillac Williams and Ronnie Brown.
That's so many words to say he was awful last year. Completely outplayed by Perine
He seems too big for a running back. Like watching him he's tall, kinda heavy, runs tall and just doesn't look that fast.
There's one rb from 2022 with 1.5 yards after contact that's still on an NFL roster, and it's Joe Mixon.
Draft Charbonnet
It didn't help that we rarely did play-action, but yeah, so done with Mixon
My personal hope would be cut Mixon, trade low level assets for Ekeler (4th + 6th), give Ekeler a 2 year extension and front load the fucker.
hard to imagine the Bengals not taking a back in the draft
Anyone know if Kenny McIntosh declared this year? I’m ootl
Whoever graded him for PFF this year should be fired
Dude is washed, its so obvious
He's not the Baltimore Ravens. I mean I don't mean any disrespect -- but he's not the Baltimore Ravens.
RB and legal issues? Yeah he's finished
And this is near the bottom of the list of the reasons.
long overdue.
Cut RB to save money to pay WR  is a no brainer move in today's game.  Let alone when that RB kind of sucks
If it's easy why haven't they done it yet? To see if they can land the RB they want?
It's hard to say if he's washed inconsistent could be his middle name
I know that this isn't the point of your comment, but calling him an easier cut than Tre Waynes last year makes me upset
Gibbs at 28 would be reaching for need and probably a dumb move but I'm not sure I'd even be mad at it since it'd be so fun lol.
The only one the bengals would be looking at is Bijan. They have stated any RB that they draft needs to be able to pass block.
I went agaisnt him in two leagues, I won one of the games somehow lol
I remember that day well.
Israel to Cincinnati
Yeah I’d say go after Hunt but he’s just as washed and arguably an even bigger off-the-field piece of shit than Mixon
Hey fucking an actual nuanced take bravo
Sure, but to me the obvious takeaway is that the Bengals faced this alignment frequently because of their offensive sets and Mixon was terrible compared to other backs against it.  Even if it's a disadvantage, the Bengals need a back who can succeed against it more.
Good luck, I've been fighting this battle for years.
This has some sense but ignores that fewer people in the box means more room to cut, even if there aren't the same number of blockers
Perine was a slightly worse runner, a much better blocker, and a worse pass catcher/route runner. It made it tough on 3rd downs, because we didn't have a guy who could reliably pass protect *and* beat a LB on a route.  Perine was solid, but was a less explosive athlete even with Mixon clearly on the decline.
Better than Mixon at everything besides break away runs
No it isnt  It goes  1. Expensive  2. Washed  3. Legal issues
arguably the most overrated RB in the league
Save more cap space if you cut him after June 1st.
Probably waiting until after the draft.
I really don’t think it’s a reach for Gibbs at 28 but I’m very high on him. I think he’s like a Kamara/Charles type of back.
I'm fairly confident you guys go corner, edge or tackle at 28
Same. Dude I played against was heated lmao. Ended up only losing 2 games all year and won it all.
Man I had bad luck in fantasy last season. One week I got torched by CMC. Then the CMC owner traded him. The following week I got torched by CMC again.
I faced Fields that week so I needed all 5 tds
Sounds like a long journey.
Keep your mitts off of Izzy
I'd prefer Ibrahim.
Bro this subreddit has obviously never once made a mistake. Hunt did some dumb shit one time and he's a piece of shit. Imagine everyone in the world judged you solely on your worst moment. We would all be pieces of shit in that world. Fucking have some forgiveness my lord
Watch the video and see if you still think Hunt did anything notably bad.
> arguably an even bigger off-the-field piece of shit than Mixon  No the hell he is not.  Kareem Hunt kicked a girl, and quite frankly not even hard. That's it.  Mixon straight up punched a woman in the face. And that's not even all he's done.
Sure. My point wasn't really about Mixon.
I'd take a little less room over an unblocked defender any day.
Got the Oklahoma backfield at the wrong time 😩
Perine was a better runner IMO
You may be getting downvoted, but you aren't wrong when looking at it from the team/nfl point of view. Heck, Alvin Kamara is still on a roster after the whole world seeing videos of what he did.
Why are you getting downvoted lol. You're absolutely right
You could even add team tensions before legal troubles. Legal troubles are hardly a concern unless it’s on video and released or so severe they are serving jail time.
You can cut him now though and still designate him a post-June 1st cut.  The only answer that makes any sense really is the Bengals are waiting to see how the cards fall in the draft.
You have $16.9m in cap space right now and cutting him after June 1st means you spread dead money into next year. Why would you do that?
I do not understand the cap. Why in the world would there be a difference?
Dude looked like the most athletic person on the field every time he touched the ball
Unless all the ones worthwhile are gone. We've been burned too often recently with drafting a position of need instead of value+need. Jackson Carman and Billy Price are great recent examples of this, but there's been others (the 2015 draft class in particular)
TE.
Tight end is more likely than edge considering who will likely be there at 28. There were also reports that they were seriously looking to draft a TE last year, but no one fell to them. Now our TE room is empty besides Irv Smith on a 1 year deal.
Oh I'd be so mad if I lost too. My buddy somehow kept it together.
Cmc personally doesn't like you lmao
Maybe in the old days.[Now, it’s like a 16hr flight.](https://www.google.com/search?q=israel+to+cincinnati+flight+time&client=firefox-b-1-m&ei=10gwZMquC46bwbkPr4iMqAw&oq=israel+to+cincinnati+flight+time&gs_lcp=ChNtb2JpbGUtZ3dzLXdpei1zZXJwEAMyBQghEKsCOggIABCiBBCwAzoKCCEQoAEQwwQQCkoECEEYAVDzDVjJFmC5GGgAcAB4AIABrQGIAe4HkgEDMC44mAEAoAEByAEFwAEB&sclient=mobile-gws-wiz-serp#sbfbu=0&pi=israel%20to%20cincinnati%20flight%20time)  Ahhhh the future….
Only for Gibbs or Robinson.  Gimme Izzy
Good news is a lot of these guys would help
I wouldn't agree with him being better as a runner last year - but I guess you do look a little better than the RB1 when you're a change of pace guy getting carries when that RB1 isn't doing anything special
yeah bro ain’t wrong at all
Yeah no reason to prematurely cut him. Doing it sooner doesn’t help them at all, and maybe there’s a small chance that something unexpected happens and they could use him for one more season
The Cards have actually been rising in the draft since Kyler went down.
It doesn't save more cap space in the long run, it lets you spread out the pain over 2 years
There are quite a few corners/edges that are intriguing that should be avaliable around 28
Ewwww
That seems like a long time until I actually stopped to think about the distances involved. Damn we quick boys.
He looked better when he took over the starting role
Depends on philosophy. Those would be purely build for the future decisions, especially since the Bengals have high level starters at corner/edge, and edge has 3 guys there. Could you agree to put off improvements to your team in the midst of a Super Bowl window now for being better in '24, '25, and '26? The former could result in a Super Bowl next year, the latter ensures you're in the conversation longer  For the playmaker, the Bengals biggest problem was getting teams out of Cover 2 looks, especially when one of the big 3 (Chase, Boyd, Higgins) goes down. We saw this in the AFCCG when Boyd went down and other than the highlight reel catches Chase and Higgins made in double coverage, the offense couldn't move in the second half. If you have a Kelce esque TE or a running back that can break one off at any time, that forces defenses out of Cover 2, opening up Chase/Higgins to single coverage looks, which opens up the whole offense and gets those big plays they had in the '21 super bowl run  On the other hand, a corner takes pressure off of replacing Chido, who's in a contract year, and a DL pick would take pressure off of our expensive DL. Interior DL is a bigger need than edge, but this is a bad class for that unless Kancey falls (who's my run to the podium pick). These picks keep us in the conversation longer and help when contracts like Chido, Hendrickson, Hubbard, Reader, and Hill come up in the next year or 2, but don't help much this year, which makes contending with the Chiefs harder this year.
Corner and edge are positions teams should always strive to be deep in. The cowboys de5 had 5 sacks last year iirc lol
And right now, they're deep at both and LB. They aren't deep at IDL
Oh shoot; the police plugged him back in
Old man gave me that when I was in Grade 7. Seen a lot of action. 9MM, safety always off. Told me he was proud of me once. Fucking prick.  - Joe Mixon
RBs need to chill.
Pulling a gun on a woman in a road rage incident is just a misdemeanor?  Uh, TIL?!?
Can we cut him now?
Cut him and sign Ekeler.
Please just cut him and be done with it
Joe Mixon was the 2nd shooter on the grassy knoll.
Please just cut him. It is time to move forward
Obviously you can’t be menacing with a gun but once I figured out it was a road rage incident there was a really small part of me that was like “I can see how Cincy traffic could push a person to this”
Hey Joe, you’re getting suspended buddy
Cincy did such a big turnaround as far as perception of the team goes and Mixon is a remnant. Get rid of him.
To everyone that said they dropped the charges because he was famous and blah blah blah, the DA said from the beginning they would refile if the investigation showed that they should, and clearly it did.
RBs are not that valuable in todays NFL to have someone like this still on a team… guilty or not it’s bringing a lot of bad press to the Bengals, a team who was just starting to finally get some good press and more fans
Just like on the field the last few years, Mixon is being caught from behind before he can escape.
Shitty person is actually shitty, surprise.
Hey Joe, where you goin with that gun in your hand?
This guy stinks
this guy has a very bad reputation.
It's been a rough time for the folks who love to mindlessly defend this guy
Been awhile since we drafted a RB high
Jahmyr Gibbs you are a Cincinnati Bengal
[Joe. Mixon. Is. Garbage.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm1IYtVuRXk)
Mixon just out there menacing again
snip snap! snip snap!
Yeah, he’s gotta go
He gone
I'm starting to think this guy is a bit of a troublemaker.
This man is an upstanding member of society and role model to all
The Browns just got a new RB
This dude is just a major PoS
Make that joe re-charged.
Sounds like a fine fellow
Cut this fool
Didn’t he punch a women at a bar while in college?
But countless Redditors told me he must be innocent or they wouldn’t have dropped it?  Did the DA discuss this with them?
Where's all the people saying it would be "double Jeopardy" if they reopened it now? I told you fools he might get hit later on after they collected more security footage etc.
I was told by a bengals fan that he was exonerated tho!
Imagine having enough athletic talent to make millions off of only to be stupid enough to throw it all away.
Its gonna be hilarious reading the comments in the previous mixon thread a month or so ago.  They couldnt have possibly seen this coming, but it is definitely a fit of hilarious irony
Dude savagely knocks his 110 pound girlfriend into the shadow realm, and y’all are somehow surprised he’s still a piece of shit? Imagine what he’s like when he knows he won’t get caught. Fuck this guy
Something something political persecution
Weren't Bengal fans in here defending him after the charges were temporarily dropped? 🤔
Browns: “heavy sweating”
Dismissed when he was on the team. Now that he's likely off the team. Charge his ass!!!
Leave Joe alone this is ridiculous
someone needs to lock this man away somewhere until the season starts
Joe Mixon framed Ray Lewis
You can be brought to trial twice for the same crime?
This guy is a piece of shit with an extensive criminal record.  There's no question that Mixon should get the death penalty w/o trial.
I knew he was guilty from  the very beginning, anyone with a brain could see that.   But I just assumed he got one of his friends to take the fall.   I don’t know if that payment didn’t go through or what.   When he was punching women back in college, he always got away with it. But I guess at this level, police want more than a signed jersey.
Wait, is it double jeopardy? You can’t be charged twice for the same crime, right?
Zeke time in Cincy now?
Bijan to the rescue
C'mon Joe! Smh
Good he's a fucking pile of shit human.
Whoops check bounced.
The AFC North is a nightmare this off-season
I wasn’t even aware he ran on a battery, the more you know I suppose.   Nice of them to give him some juice though.
People forget about the vid of this dude knocking that chick out when coming out of school. Violent af  Pepperidge farm remembers…
besides his 5 TD game last season this guy sucked pretty much the whole season. i know the stats say he had a pretty good season but anyone who actually watched him play knows that it was just a result of the amount of touches and catches he was given. his YPC were terrible and he was stuffed at the goalline numerous times. frustrating fantasy pick
this guy hit the Antonio brown bandwagon quick..
Mixon gna be a beast backing up Chubb
If we do want to cut him, I think it would be advantageous to not play our hand until after the draft. If we sign a veteran like Zeke, then suddenly the Bengals don't look like a team that's going to take an RB, and we won't have someone jump us draft night.
He threatened to shoot someone.  He should be in fucking jail
some of these comments did not age well lmao  https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/10s6tdv/pelissero_just_spoke_to_bengals_rb_joe_mixons/
Wonderful guy, the bungles sure know how to pick em
Even as a Ravens fan I enjoy watching Joe Mixon play. He’s going down a bad path. The whole game is worse without Mixon out there.
Evil Joe
Definitely handled by Cincy police in way that invited speculation about preferential treatment. At the very least, it seems like they kicked the can down the road so that Mixon could deal with the charges during the offseason. Maybe that’s not what happened, but that’s how it looks.    [https://local12.com/amp/news/local/cpd-detective-disciplined-menacing-charge-bengals-running-back-joe-mixon-cincinnati-dan-hils-fop-chief-theetge-gun-woman-road-rage-dropped-invstigation](https://local12.com/amp/news/local/cpd-detective-disciplined-menacing-charge-bengals-running-back-joe-mixon-cincinnati-dan-hils-fop-chief-theetge-gun-woman-road-rage-dropped-invstigation)
Did the local authorities seriously not charge him so he could play in the playoffs??  Holy shit. 😄
"left open to refile once properly investigated"  ...so why would you dismiss those charges?
Welcome to Cincinnati Jahmyr Gibbs/Zach Charbonnet/Tank Bigsby or Sean Tucker.
They plugged me in, I ain't plug back though
What happened to the Cincy fans claiming he wasn't even in town during this incident?  Edit: oh it's yet another incident, of course I should have known 🙄 . Convenient that this incident happened before the Buffalo game, charges were dropped on February 3rd, and now that he appears expendable the charges are refiled. Not a good look but understand the prosecutor needed time to gather more evidence.
Fuck off Cyrus
“Fuck off, I got work to do.” - Joe Mixon
"Why don't we fuck on?"
I know one of you dickheads did this to my car, 'cause you're the only ones who know I failed Grade 10.
You better chill out there, heavy metal dick.
Cyrus you’re a dick!
A case can probably be made that they have the worst CTE this early in their careers
Breaking News: NFL star gets lenient sentence. No but for real idk how that’s possible
Seriously. How that doesn’t warrant a minimum of a year behind bars is insane.
it seems like the kind of thing that would permanently alter one's life, but probably Mixon probably hasn't thought about it since
Well it was in Ohio right?
Pulling a gun on anybody should be same crime, no?
8 more weeks
Would be cool but Ekeler would have to be traded for and he wants an extension that we most likely wouldn't be interested in giving him
Sign Zeke and draft a rookie
Hey fuck you
The RB about to turn 28 and won’t stop complaining about needing more money?
If only it was as easy as just signing him. I really doubt we'll trade for him. We're getting a RB day 2 of the draft.
Problem is you either are trading too much for 1 year or are overpaying for 4 when you need to pay Burrow, Higgins and Chase in that timeframe.   I like Ekeler, but production wise give me Higgins over him no question. I can find an RB that will do half of what Ekeler does, finding a #2 like Higgins is hard.
I bet some team would trade a super late pick for Mixon.
Its not that simple because of Mixons dead cap. We can’t afford Ekelers extension
No cut him and draft Bijan.
Please don't.
Joe Mixon hijacked Malaysia Airlines flight 370
At this point I believe it
Don't worry, Mixon later claimed JFK called him the N-word so it was all justified.
no, that was Ace Ventura
He’s been overrated his whole career anyways.
That’s kinda of the thing though. Traffic drives you nuts but what separates a functioning person from a psychopath is that the functioning person doesn’t take out a gun when someone cuts them off.
I live in the Cincy area.  The people in this area are legit some of the most passive aggressive drivers I've seen anywhere.
Pretty much why I don't keep a gun in my car because good god the drivers in my area would really make me wanna menace with it lol.
Imagine being a star player making $8million for a team that's on a Super Bowl run and giving some random asshole on the road the power to take it all away from you
Not until 2 years from now. They let Kamara not only play the whole season, but play in the Pro Bowl after he got out lol.
If Kamara hasn’t been suspended yet then there’s no chance Mixon gets suspended
Ok, but what does the cowboy side of you think? You kinda got a Jekyll and Hyde thing goin on lol.
Big facts. The past few years have been all about removing the negative energy and image from the team both on and off the field. This doesn’t help at all. It’s time for him to leave, I could care less if he agrees to a massive paycut. He’s just not worth the headache at this point.
We found our Ray Rice
Breaking a woman’s facial bones will do that!
I don't think you're gonna find a lot of them.
I never did it mindlessly. I think there were reasons to believe he was a young guy that's still good that made a horrible mistake and was being a role model in the city to make up for it. That came with zero tolerance for any other infractions beyond the pre-Bengals transgression, though. No longer defending him now that off field issues are happening again.  It's weird that he went so long being completely clean just to screw it up now... maybe he just did a good job of hiding his issues.
6 years to be exact
I think we would have to take him at 28 for that to happen.
Yeah, in a class with Tyreek Hill...
Yes, I believe he was hitting on her and she was turning him down. They got into a verbal altercation that turned physical and she pushes him then he grabbed her and in response she slapped him and then decked her in the face.  https://abc13.com/news/video-of-ou-player-mixon-punching-woman-released/1660527/
Yeah, it wasn't difficult to see this coming.
It’s only double jeopardy if he’s found not guilty in a court of law.   This has nothing to do with filing charges.     Whoever said that is a fucking idiot
That wasn't even his girlfriend, it was a girl who was out with her friends that he kept hitting no while getting rejected.
*IT'S A WITCH HUNT!!!*
Steelers fans have been defending Rothlesberger for over 10 years now.
Eating chili on spaghetti
In this thread, right above you, asking if they can finally cut him.
Not defending Mixon as ardently as Chiefs fans defended Tyreek
We've all denounced our fanhood because of this news. As of today, the Cincinnati Bengals have zero fans. Joe Mixon being recharged with a misdemeanor has singlehandedly dismantled an entire fan base.
Most of us want him gone lol not sure what you mean
Yo mama’s house
Yeah I don’t know what this comment means, most Bengals fans have said he should be cut this off season for months
The majority of this thread are bengals fans talking shit about Joe Mixon.
Lol what? I pumped my fist when I read this tweet.
Protesting outside of the houses of referees owned by Fat Andy.
I'm here. Why, what's up?
Wrong incident (I kno, sounds wild, dont it lol)
He was gonna get cut anyway so they don't have to defend him anymore like they did for years. Will still justify having Jackson Carmen on the roster tho
Or hear me out. Get a decent human being at RB
You can't be *tried* for the same crime twice.  Charges can definitely be reintroduced if more evidence comes to light and there was never a trial.
It’s only double jeopardy if he’s tried twice for the same crime.  He was never tried in court for this.   Learn the law or stfu
He needs to contact Rodgers' cave guy.
For real, he broke the jaw and cheek of a girl who was rejecting his advances, that's a major red flag.
This is actually a different incident
>  Convenient they dropped charges right before the Buffalo game, and now that he appears expendable the charges are refiled. Not a good look.  Be it far from me to defend the police, but this is just the wrong timeline of events. The aggravated assault incident he is being charged for *happened* before the playoff game against Buffalo, they didn't "drop charges right before the Buffalo game".   The charges were filed several weeks later and then dropped within days as the police determined they needed more evidence. The fact he is being charged again just means they have been able to complete the investigation and he is (probably) screwed.
Different incident I think. It's understandable to get them mixed up, he's been involved in quite a few "incidents". In fact, I'm starting to think he might just not be such a great guy.
You got this mixed up with the shooting, which honestly the fact I even had to say that shows mixon should be gone
Said the same thing about Watson. It was awfully convenient that 30 something women came forward days after his trade request from the Texans.  I'm not doubting he did it. Just think that the Texans were covering it up. Until they felt their reason to do so was leaving.
Bro you barely got half your facts right, just stop lol. You're just looking for a reason to hit the Bengals. If you're genuinely pissed off at mixon fine but if this was the jags or something you probably wouldn't even be commenting lol
> Convenient they dropped charges right before the Buffalo game, and now that he appears expendable the charges are refiled.  They didn't charge him until after KC game.  It happened friday before buffalo game.
A Browns fan telling another it’s not a good look lol
Browns fan reaching so hard to try and make anyone else in the division look comparable to mr.60+ allegations lol
I love how you were wrong so you become petty as fuck despite being wrong.
Browns fans really throwing stones 😂
It’s best when you try to be condescending to also not be dumb.
Everything about your comment is wrong. Even your edit. Oh well.
I've taken so much shit from other Bengals fans for dogging Mixon, but I stand by the feeling it was a massive organizational ass showing that there is no "New Dey" once Perine and Hurst were let walk while keeping this shitbag and the lineman that raped a fifteen year old. Taylor/Katie's org is no different than Mike Brown's. They're going to waste Burrow's Super Bowl window trying to get douchebags on a discount, which following Joe's math, is his entire career down the drain.
Lol chill out, deshaun supporter
Dumbass
Iirc, it didn’t come out until a week or so after the Buffalo game.
We don’t have your hash Cyrus now frig offf
Can we have 5 cyrus
"Well, how about we fuck down?"
Nah, linemen are hit literally every play
The old double whammy.   Being rich/famous often gets you special treatment from starstruck cops, prosecutors, judges, and witnesses (although they all deny it).   But even if you do get charged and prosecuted, being rich/famous gets you expensive high-powered (and often publicity seeking) lawyers to weasel your way out of it or at least down to the bare minimum.   Only occasionally is someone so famous/disliked by a large portion of the public (outside their own fanbase) that they are made an example of....i.e. Martha Stewart
Yup, we have shit gun laws. Just passed a “stand your ground” law and repealed requirements for concealed carries last year. God I hate our horribly gerrymandered districts, turned what should be a 50/50 state into the Alabama of the north.
You don't actually have to cut him on June 1. You can designated him for June 1 cuts (up to 2 players can be designated). Once they are designated they are cut as if they will be cut on the second in terms of dead money though it doesn't create any cap space until then but they will instantly become a free agent.  The reason they are keeping him right now is because they don't currently have anyone of the roster to take his place.
This is what I want. Zeke might still have a little gas in the tank while the rookie gets up to speed. And then you have Zeke for 3rd down blocking
The Bengals don’t need a center, actually with how much joe Burrow has been slaughtered back there, maybe they do
Bijan and Zeke would be good
I'll pass. Zeke has definitely lost a step or 2.
If we're cutting Mixon on performance, no point in signing Zeke. He's worse at everything Mixon does except pass pro.
Bijingle Robingleson
Gah damn JG Ekeler   It’s his money and he needs it now
Receiving RBs have historically lasted much longer in the NFL than simple running backs with okay receiving.  I mean hell Darren Sproles played until he was 35...and dude was a speed back with receiving ability
He’s still a damn good RB. I know he’s at the age where RB’s fall off a cliff, but I think he’s got quite a bit left in the tank. He wasn’t run into the ground like Zeke considering MGIII took the majority of the carries the first couple years he was in the league iirc.
By gawd that sounds like Ravens music.
I'd take a conditional 7th for Mixon in a heartbeat
Maybe offer him for DHop
Mixon only has 3 million in dead cap post June1
Yeah. I don’t know the Bengals cap situation. I still love the idea though.
~~I~~ Joe Mixon broke the dam.
I never understood the Joe Mixon hype. Dude has one or two good games per year and then basically disappears. He's the Hockenson of running backs.
So you're telling me I shouldn't brandish a gun at someone going 5mph under the speed limit.
Dude, the one time I sat in some really bad, rush hour + bad accident traffic, in July, with no functioning AC in the car...I completely understood every road rage gun law in existence.
Its exhausting. I hate it.
Can confirm. Source: my dad behind the wheel 🤦🏼‍♂️
There's a lot in this comment that to me suggests you maybe shouldn't be owning a gun in the first place
4 game suspension
Valid, waiting for the response.
Clearly he wants Zeke to the Bengals, so we can get him that ring the boys never did ;)
Difference is he was already “Ray Rice” when you drafted him knowingly lol.
Definitely not like the people who continue to defend Tyreek Hill.
We must have different Reddits, because it’s been like Mixon hired about 20k PR reps with Bengals flairs to defend him here.
I mean more the folks insisting he wasn’t even in Cincinnati with that kid got shot, or declaring that these charges being dropped initially meant the police didn’t believe he had done it.
I think if the top targets are gone it's worth a look. He feels like a better scheme fit for us especially as a receiver out of the backfield
If anything this is Final Jeopardy.   What is, he is fucked?
I love seeing Steeler fans trying to talk shit in the Deshaun Watson threads
AFC N is just a bunch of pots calling kettles black at this point lol.
Let me clarify. I seem to remember Bengal fans acting like he'd been vindicated when the charges were dropped, even though it was clear that they likely would be refiled.  And now they've been refiled, and people are like "wha WHAAAA?"
Don't forget the mountain of cheese with crackers, and hot sauce of course.
Yeah what of it
U got a problem wit that👀👀👀
Bruh I still see chiefs fans say tyreek didn't actually beat his gf up and was totally innocent from time to time lol
Thank you for your service
What? Literally everyone wants Carman gone.  We didn't even want him when the team drafted him lol
Literally no one justifies Carman being on the team lmaoo
No one even likes Carman though and this is hilarious coming from a Browns fan
We’re in the AFC North???
Mixon has two gun-related incidents involving the police in one offseason, a violent incident in college involving punching a woman, struggles in pass protection, and is in probably the most replaceable position in all of football - why is he still on the Bengals?
It really does say it all, if I'm Cincy it's long past the time to move on.
You can only be around for one incident at a time so maybe they’re right about the second one
> Be it far from me  My favorite hymn
Yes, I was confused by conflicting replies at first that said the charges were dropped date vs the date the actual incident happened, thanks for helping clear it up.
Got it,  it was a different incident, but Cincy fans were still wrong about him being out of town for that one.
Plus didn’t it turn out that the reports of Mixon not being there were false? Or am i spreading fake news?
Texans 100% we're covering it up, no doubt. Just like we're hearing about the Ja Morant situation, the Grizzlies "worked with police" when he was accused in multiple incidents. It's fucked up.
The OP you're going at, like many of us, wasn't immediately sure which of the two very recent Mixon incidents this was related to...that's already been acknowledged and isn't even what's being debated now...you're way behind on where the discussion even is at this point so I wouldn't interject yourself lol
> They didn't charge him until after KC game.  Not necessarily saying there's anything to it, but that doesn't really improve the optics of it all.
That's still a really bad look, I think we can all agree on that...maybe just coincidence but it sure begs some questions.
Yeah I found that ironic. But I’m also not a fan of the roster moves the browns have made either.
Not at all, I'm fully against Watson but that has nothing to do with Mixon. Feel free to look up my post history. Also, not all Bengals fans support Mixon, I stand with them on this news.
Joe was also in town for the other incident, sorry pal. As many others commented below, it's understandable when he's been involved in two gun related stories in a short period of time. Nothing petty about gun violence, nor anything else Mixon has done in his illustrious career of harassing, assaulting, and threatening women. Stay classy. Go back to playing COD kid, the adults are talking.
At Joe Mixon? Absolutely, and we're certainly not alone.
It's probably best to just admit you were wrong, because Mixon was in town for the other incident as well. Have a great day, your franchise should have kept Perine because Mixon is likely gone now.
Yes we discussed that, originally someone replied saying the charges were dropped before the buffalo game, then another clarified the actual incident happened before the Buffalo game. Charges were dropped February 3rd, if that makes you feel better I'll edit my comment again.
> the lineman that raped a fifteen year old  I'm sorry what
I applaud you for sticking by your moral code, unfortunately two of your fans in particular in this thread continue to defend Mixon to no end. iMHO Perine was just as effective if not more than Mixon anyway, at such a devalued position, why even deal with a headache like a Joe Mixon? Burrow is a great dude man, and I'll be rooting for him regardless.
Literally you can check my post history if you think I support Watson, please do. You probably also claim to have not known about this either:   https://www.si.com/nfl/2022/04/29/bengals-jackson-carman-rape-allegation-zac-taylor-nfl-draft
He really is, luckily your front office will be getting rid of him soon it appears.
You better chill out there, heavy metal dick.
We just got robbed by the Hubble Bubble telescope and his little fruit car
That's true but the velocity of Running backs probably has an effect, against much bigger guys on average. There's a difference between going into a scrum with a guy 12 inches away from you and running full speed into them from 10ft away.
So only lineman are subject to CTE?
It's not special treatment. It's the ability to afford good lawyers.
Whole lot of criminals running around the country without being famous and without expensive lawyers.  It’s called our laws are soft as fuck. He isn’t getting special treatment, this is the reality.
Feel free to leave
Wow if we had much tougher laws here I’m sure Joe mixon would have absolutely followed them!
Bengals have plenty of cap room.  No reason to worry about June 1 cut stuff.
True but there's no reason for them to take the extra steps when him being on the roster doesn't really do anything, I doubt they care about the chatter
And if all else fails, he can play center!
> Zeke might still have a little gas in the tank while the rookie gets up to speed.   He really doesn't. You are far better off giving those snaps to a rookie or some other younger vet.
Have we been watching the same zeke?
*while rookie gets up to speed*  TIL rookie rbs need time to get up to speed
He doesn’t. The guy is washed. Ekeler has less wear than zeke and could be the next gio down the stretch.
Seriously though, our center is also a good LG, and our current LG was a serviceable but below average rookie we picked in the 4th. So actually we *could* have a legit use for a center.
JG Ekeler 877 CASH NOW
I love Darren Sproles
Ekeler already has only 85 fewer career touches on offense than Sproles retired with, with 79 more career carries.  Factoring in punt/kick returns Sproles is of course a lot higher, but the primary reason Sproles lasted so long is that the highest number of touches on offense he ever had in a single season was 173. Ekeler has finished well beyond that amount in 3 of the last 4 years, and the only year he didn't he still finished with 170 - and that was in only 10 games.
Agree. He might be worth something like  a 2 year/$28m fully guaranteed with a 3rd year to spread out the guarantees, but that would have to be for a team with 1) the space to do so and 2) legitimately talented enough to win a superbowl in this 2 year timeframe.   Bengals wouldn’t even be fair at this point. But this to me would be a great way to capitalize on the window with Burrow on his rookie deal.
Joe Mixon did 9/11
Hockenson was fantastic with us
Only if they're in the far left lane
As long as they are in the right lane you shouldn’t. In the passing lane? Get out the fucking bazooka
“I’m sorry officer, I didn’t know I couldn’t do that”
They don't know our bad drivers are all on valium.  We're not like the other cities in that regard.
I’ll walk before I ride in a car with no AC again.  At my old job, we had a bunch of warehouse issues and employees out, and I had to go out and make a delivery to a customer. I had to unload a pallet into the back of a van while in dress clothes, and then drive 20 miles in a van with AC that was like a person blowing on me.   Humidity at 89%, I arrived at the store and had to unload the product, put it on the shelf, and talk with the managers.   I was fucking soaked.  Nothing more embarrassing than standing somewhere talking to someone in a professional setting while you look like you just went through Log Mountain at Six Flags.  If I had a gun in the car that day, it would have been used on myself.
It's just a joke about bad drivers, but I also don't personally own any guns anyway for a multitude of reasons.
Well is there a difference? Ray Rice was Ray Rice when you drafted him aswell. Checkmate. Nah I’m playing both are scum
The vast majority of people in the Bengals sub were ready to move on mid season last year.
I'm genuinely curious where you're seeing Bengals fans defend him right now
Ohhhh Gotcha. Yeah, that makes sense. I hope he’s gone soon
I love other fanbases trying to act like their team is morally superior.
Honestly, based on pure volume alone, they are not the same. One's a large pile of shit and one's a metric ton of shit.  Just because Roethlisberger was a rapist doesn't mean Watson can't be called out... by anyone.
https://www.westword.com/news/49-denver-broncos-arrests-since-2000-tied-for-most-in-the-nfl-9885787  This isn’t a game broncos fans can play.
Stop generalizing an entire fan base
Plenty more of us were ready to move on before either incident
I don't think anyone acted *vindicated*, but the charges were in fact dropped, and at that point it made sense for us to say "hey, maybe this wasn't as bad as it sounded originally."  Now it looks like it probably *was* as bad as it first appeared. We're still low on facts, but I don't feel like these are unreasonable changes in public opinion.
Sounds good. It’s cold and rainy today so I wouldn’t mind some.
That was about the incident at his house in which his sister was the culprit. He deserves whats coming to him for this.
Can’t talk about other teams having that issue when your own team has one though.
Like clockwork lmao
Between the Bengals drafting Carman despite him raping a 15 year old, Joe Mixon, first ballot HoF garbage person Deshaun Watson, Raping Big Ben and murdering Ray Lewis, the AFC North really is a wild place
Lamar's available
I fucking love that you included the struggles with pass pro
He will probably be a post-June 1st cut to better play the cap.  I think they could go ahead and announce the cut now and designate it a post-June 1 cut but don't think there's any motivation to do it early if his legal issues don't become a bigger PR issue in the meantime.  Someone that knows more about the situation could correct me though.
we have to wait to cut him
“Violent incident”. He broke her face bones with his fist if anyone was curious
> struggles in pass protection  Zeke doesn't look too bad now does he Zac Taylor?
The Who?
This is rich, coming from a Browns fan
No you're right, he was there.
He was out of town, flew back in that night itself
I didn't comment deep into the discussion, just on his top-level comment. It was enough for me to stop there.
😂😂 my guy take a nap or something. I didn't even give my opinion on the situation. I literally said if you're pissed off mixon fine I totally get it.  I'm not defending mixon or attacking your franchise, just your motives lol
What the take all of a week to look into shit before charging someone with a crime?  Look, I think most cops are assholes, Mixon is a shithead at best, and generally don't have a great outlook about most of the "justice" system... But several days of investigation before charging someone with a crime, when the act of charging them alone will clearly have a drastic affect on the rest of their life, is pretty reasonable.   If you want to shit on the Bengals, shit on them for Carman and IF they keep Mixon now, not whatever scenario you think is happening here. Do you think Mike Brown paid off the DA to wait a week, then change their mind and the charges?
Fan enough to keep supporting a rapist and serial sexual assaulter.
Lol your original comment is still entirely incorrect and is just an obvious attempt to shit on Bengals fans and you're just doubling down  Thin skin blocked me for this LMAO
Ahh yes because we all know the Browns have absolutely no players with character/legal issues lol
Lmao, your dumpster organization has totally rotten your brain, huh? Lmao stay mad lil buddy.
https://www.si.com/nfl/2022/04/29/bengals-jackson-carman-rape-allegation-zac-taylor-nfl-draft
Ya’ll need to go outside, seriously.
Nope I’m fully aware of jackson carman and I fucking hate him. Fair point.
Oh shit Randy’s taking off his pants
Oh yea? Why don’t you go back to the bowling alley you came from
Yes, but it’s been established that the predominant risk factor for CTE isn’t actually “getting your bell rung” but having more total impacts. Linemen have more impact in drills and get hit every single play, RBs don’t get hit every play they’re on the field or even every play they have the ball
Yeah full speed against full strength is different than full strength against full strength.
Not what I said at all
So our laws are soft as fuck while we blow away everyone else on the planet (that isn't an authoritarian dictatorship) in incarceration rates?   And we don't just blow everybody else away by national rate. We also do by individual state. Nearly every state in the USA would rank near the top of the incarceration rate if you divided them up and considered each one as a seperate country.   And this is also despite American having a higher burden of proof and more legal presumption of innocence compared to most other modern/civilized nations in the world (some where you have to "prove that you're innocent" rather than be proven you're guilty).   But you think we need more of the population locked up? Lmfao.
It’s a designation. No reason not to take the space:
He wasn’t worth his contract and he’s not the Zeke he was but this is an overreaction. He’s a great blocking RB that put 12 in the end zone last year. He’s capable
I'm not sure about his pass-blocking but iirc I saw a stat something like 'correctly ran plays' essentially quantifying *did the RB hit the correct hole* and Zeke finished #1. Pretty valuable on short-downs.
I have doubts trayveon williams is a better option
Zeke as a goal line back on a team intrigues me though. He played that role on Dallas and it was successful
We really just want him for blocking and goal line.
Not always, but sometimes. Especially with the pass blocking downs
Ekeler also will cost 4-5x as much as Zeke, and we would have to the trade for him and give him a long term deal.   No one is arguing that Zeke > Ekeler in 2023. But for the cost, and the fact it could likely be a short term or one year deal, Zeke makes way more sense for the Cincinnati.   If we trade for, and extend Ekeler, we 100% can’t keep Tee in 2024
If Tippman or someone like that falls to 3 I could easily see us picking him and shifting Karras.
He’s never given up a sack while playing center
I have a closing window and I need cash now
me too, takes me back.
I'm not saying Ekler is going to last how Sproles will...just that he will maintain effectiveness longer than the average RB.  You get maybe another 2 really good years out of him..Charger should rip up his current contract and give him a new 3 year deal at 9 million per...first 2 fully guaranteed
If a team is that close to a Superbowl they'd probably be better off spending that cap space other than a RB imo. Recent history shows Superbowl teams don't have to spend a ton on RBs. The past decade or so I'm pretty sure the highest paid leading rusher in a postseason Superbowl run was paid under 3 million and I'm pretty sure there's only one real asterisk in that list which would be Marshawn not leading the Seahawks in the postseason rushing. Pretty much every other team ran with young guys on cheap deals or run it by committee.
Joe Mixon shot first at Lexington.
Little known fact you're actually allowed to run these people off the road
Or going 20-30 mph below the speed limit as they try and merge from the on-ramp
Wasn't there a video recently of a commuter performing the PIT maneuver on the Pontchartrain Causeway and they essentially gave him the keys to the city and $10,000?  My memory is fuzzy.
Redditors are fun at parties..
It's just a bit jarring seeing one fanbase cheer for and defend a probable rapist and then turn around and talk shit about another fanbase doing the same thing like 2 years later
But they said they would likely be refiling, and that there was just an extra step that had been missed per their policy. So there wasn't any reason to really think the dismissal was anything but some red tape, not how bad it actually was.
I feel like a team giving a serial rapist $230 million is a bigger issue then a player on another team threatening someone with a gun. We all want Mixon cut
The AFC North needs its own Parole board 💀
Unfortunately, we've seen that the NFL is willing to overlook a lot of off field issues if they perform well on the field. Given his clear incompetence in a key facet of the role, it's worth mentioning as a reason why he's worth not keeping around.
It's the most NFL-thing ever
It reminds me of the “biggie was fat” tweet lol
IDK why pending issues would lead them to wait longer to cut him. I think if he was going to be a post June 1st cut he would've already been cut with that designation.
Why
The Bengals haven't designated anyone as a June 1 cut yet, so this is wrong.
This is wrong, you can cut him now and designate him as a June 1st cut, you don't have to wait for June 1st to cut him.
Edit: I guess I live under a rock. Thanks for correcting me y’all. Was not my intention to defend terrible behavior from anyone.
He also made amends. The conclusion of the incident had them in a room discussing the incident together, and both parties wishing each other well. How many of Desahun’s sexual assault victims have done the same?
Zeke is so good at pass pro, he’s willing to play Center
I mean, they said if they were *Cincy* , and the bengals should actually have common sense so that tracks.  They say nothing about what the browns would do, which is prolly also cut him cuz he needs to sexually assault 26 women before he gets a good deal from them. He’s well short of their reqs for a contract.
Well yeah. He's saying that so the Browns can sign him.
Don't flair attack dude, it's fucking stupid
This is so fucking dumb and the reason I don't have a stupid flair.
Tell us again why that girl deserved to be punched, Cincy fans. Good ole upstanding Joe Mixon, why won't these women leave him alone. He also got off of an assault charge in HS because he was a star athlete. All these women must be lying, where have I heard that before?
It does say it all that you've been supporting Mixon, who has assaulted 3 women now going back to college and even high school, and your high horse fans tried to ignore that while throwing stones at Browns fans. We have video evidence of your boy Joe knocking a woman out, but your fans will claim she deserved it, must have called him a name...you know when she was telling him to leave her alone because she didn't want to sleep with him. Then you'll tell me he apologized and has been a model citizen since, right? That's the Mixon defense playbook. I see one of your other fans saying this latest charge is understandable because traffic is bad in Cincy. Nice.  Edit: when Cincy front office does move on, watch the tune change from these fans who still defend him
He was at the house when the shooting happened.
I think the Bengals fans still trying to defend this scumbag should take a nap, I provided the article and evidence that mentioned his history going back to HS. You can get mad all you want I'm not the associated press or the guy who wrote that article for Bleacher Report in 2017.  The only Bengals fans I'm going at it with are those defending and downplaying Joe's history while playing whataboutism about the Browns. This thread is about Joe's latest fuck up, not one of our players, but that's the only comeback you guys have (except the two Bengals fans still blaming the women involved, they're showing no shame going even lower, notice how you don't say shit to them).
Looking into something is very different from dropping charges...which just happened to coincidence with the NFL playoffs being in progress, only to raise the same changes now. Why not just wait to drop the charges until you're sure that's the right thing to do? The real issue was that original judge was way too quick to dismiss the first time, but I'm not privy to what really drove that decision to drop charges. No I don't think Mike Brown paid off anybody because he's definitely too cheap to do that (lol sorry I couldn't resist). I'm saying it just definitely happened to help the Bengals and Mixon who got to play through all this because those charges were dropped, only to face the same charges again when Mixon appears on his way out. It's probably coincidence and based on some technicalities, but I think that's at least a curious situation.
I hardly watched any NFL games last year. And to honest it was wonderful. I had a whole day extra to get stuff done. Wasn’t stressed by my team performing badly, wasn’t stressed by the horrible NFL refs and wondering if they would blow a call.  Sure I have them in my name line. But stop watching them.
We obviously do have Watson, which has fractured our fan base and as you'll see from my post history, I'm not a supporter of Watson. How does that impact your ability to recognize what's going on with Mixon? Is this story today about Watson or Mixon? Because I don't think the Deshaun Watson allegations are going to save Joe Mixon from facing these criminal charges.  The point is your fans that keep defending Mixon should probably stop now, instead of continuing to act like this guy u/Nascent_Vagabond
You should probably not be so happy about your Mixon situation, but nothing makes a man from Hamilton county happier than sending women a message:  https://www.wcpo.com/news/local-news/amid-spike-in-domestic-violence-police-advocate-partnership-is-expanding-in-hamilton-county
Jesus christ that is fucking awful.
The irony of taking the time to shit post that nothing comment 😂
That's good to hear, I applaud you. Now go find where I've supported Watson, because I despise him as you'll easily find. What I take exception to is rampant hypocrisy. For example, this Cincy fan u/Nascent_Vagabond claiming I want to give women preferential treatment because I'm not a fan of Mixon.
Almost like we commit more crime than the rest of the world. Your point would matter if the US didn’t have a crime problem.  Edit: Make some shit up and block me, hahahahahahahahahaha, I can tell you are real smart.
it not free.  It just moves some of it to next year.  Teams with cap issues use it to kick the can down the road.  The Bengals don't need to do that.
Some guys eat in the rz by design of the offense tbh  See LeGarrette Blount in 2018(?) and Jamaal Williams last year.
So capable that a team with 1 RB on the roster that's started a game let him go without even discussing a pay cut.
Yeah he hits the correct hole but has 0 burst through it. He's like that old Leroy Hoard quote. "Coach, if you need one yard, I'll get you three yards. If you need five yards, I'll get you three yards."
I don’t disagree but then why even go for zeke. Better off just using the draft to pick someone up. Uncle lenny is still on the market and looked way better in a horrendous offense. Just saying you’re paying for zekes name at this stage in his career. Him getting trucked in the playoffs is forever burned in my memory.
Technique is a little unorthodox, but somehow it works.
…unless a team recently in the SB was possibly going to lose their pro bowl RB who accounts for 2700 yards and 25 tds in the last 2 seasons. They might think about it. Especially since they’d get a less often injured, better pass catching back in Ekeler for $2m more a year.
Joe Mixon shot first at Mos Eisly cantina
Joe Mixon started the fire
Source?
In Montana they can be shot. You have to tag the ear afterwards, but everybody lets you buy one after the fact with a wink.
People trying to merge onto a 65 while going 45 is one of the most infuriating experiences on the road
I never heard about the outcome but I saw a video of an impressive PIT maneuver on instagram recently, which was probably this incident. If you come across any follow-up info I'd love to see it  EDIT: I've seen the one you're talking about but it's not the one I was thinking of. The other one is a car moving into the grass outside the fast lane to PIT somebody on a section of highway that looks to me like an east coast parkway. Having trouble finding a link.
It's less to do with Watson and more to do with getting back at Browns fans, they said the most jokes because it's all they had and now they don't even have that, so they all switched up lol.
Talking about Carmen.
I think the AFC North could field an entire football team where every position has committed a different crime lol
The pass pro isn't nearly as bad as his 1.5 yards after contact. No 2022 running back with so few yards is still in an NFL roster except Mixon.   He had a good year catching the ball, but man he just cannot go between the tackles anymore.
A normal franchise, yes, bengals never cut them until after June 1 tho. I have no idea why!
Because it saves them money and they don't care about people complaining about rosters on the internet before the draft has even happened.
true, but thats just announcing the cut publicly. He'd still be getting cut June 1st, so I remain correct
He had the choice to walk away at any time
If it's demonstrable, go ahead and give a source demonstrating it. Even Mixon didn't accuse her of calling him the n word, he claimed her friend called him that. Meanwhile the girl claims Mixon called her gay friend the f word.
Maybe I'm remembering this wrong, but I thought it started with him harassing her and the guy she was with.
She reported slurs from Mixon and his friends and that they kept harassing her. So choose who you want to believe I guess?  Whatever was said, Mixon still gave someone who couldn’t defend themselves a severe concussion and a broken face
Even if she was being racist, assaulting her isn't an appropriate response. The distinction doesn't make the situation any different.
Kinda sucks at it tho
well if they were cincy theyd also know waiting to cut him after june 1st saves us cap
Bengals started a child rapist last year?
Did I say that? I'm all for Mixon being cut and held accountable for anything he did. I'm just saying it's stupid for a fan of a team with a serial rapist at QB to call out anyone else for not moving on from a player.
who has ever said she deserved it? Hes getting cut after june 1st, our sub had been saying to cut him. Browns fans have been grasping for straws every minute of every day, we have a shit ton of posts about what RB we can get to replace him. Enjoy your rapist QB for the next 4 years because while you're defending him Mixon will already be cut and probably doing time
ah, so NOW you care about women getting assaulted
Who's supporting Mixon? He's going to be cut, and hopefully he's going to be held accountable for whatever fuck-ups he made. Go back to your glass house.
Three women? Source? I’ve never heard anything about an incident before the video of him punching the woman, who you conveniently didn’t mention put her hands on him twice. Also can’t find anything about it online.   Also no one knows much of anything about this recent January accusation about threatening to shoot someone. It could be entirely accurate, it could be entirely made up. It’s complete he said she said at this point.   Also yes, Mixon will be gone unless he takes a major pay cut.
He was actually seen with a gun in his hands at the time of the shooting per statements (just not the gun that caused the shooting....allegedly)
Yeah that's what I'm saying. He flew back in the night it happened and therefore was there but had been out of town previously
I'm not trying to play franchise high horse. I'm not trying to get back at anyone and having nothing to do with what the other Bengals fans in the thread are saying. I simply pointed on your one comment i read that it was incorrect in a couple ways and seems very targeted at the fact that it's the Bengals and that's why you're commenting. That's it. I'm not blaming anyone on any Ohio player incidents.
He was not charged until AFTER the Bengals were out of the playoffs my guy. Mixon was going to get to play because nothing had happened beyond an accusation by their last game, and you sure as shit aren't going to start banning every player accused of something before it is even investigated. This is why there is nothing curious about it, but you simply don't know wtf you're talking about.  https://www.nfl.com/news/bengals-rb-joe-mixon-recharged-with-misdemeanor-aggravated-menacing#:~:text=Mixon%2C%20an%20Oklahoma%20product%2C%20was,Oklahoma%2C%20in%20July%20of%202014.  Mixon, 26, was initially charged on Feb. 2 after a complaint was filed in Hamilton County (Ohio) Municipal Court alleging he pointed a firearm at a woman, according to the report, and said, "You should be popped in the face, I should shoot you. The police can't get me." The incident allegedly occurred on Jan. 21, per the complaint. The Bengals defeated the Buffalo Bills in the AFC Divisional Round on Jan. 22.    And yes, I think he's a piece of shit and should be gone. I was never ok with him having been drafted, but at least he had looked like he turned his life around until now.
Imagine spending your entire day on this. You’re so pathetic lmao.
I’m not defending mixon at all. I was hoping he’d be cut before this. I just think it’s funny for browns fans of all people to call out the few Bengals fans for defending mixon when like you said half your fan base defends Deshaun Watson.
Lmao Cincinnati living rent free in your head is hilarious. I’d say I’m surprised, but you’re a browns fan so obviously you are not mentally stable.
Kinda shocking we haven't heard more about it honestly
You’re still supporting the organization, it doesn’t matter if you virtue signal and say “Watson bad”. It’s just words and changes nothing. If you buy tickets, merch, watch on cable, or do anything to financially benefit them, you’re a hypocrite.   If you think it’s okay for women to hit men first, but it’s problematic when men hit back, you are giving women preferential treatment. Pretty easy to understand.
Concussions are not the same as CTE
Gotcha. We're the only country that has a crime problem. The rest of the world (shithole countries as Donald Trump would say) must be morally superior. They don't have to lock up a large percentage of their population.   Aside from the fact that crime has been going down for decades. Were you around for the 1970s?   How about the 20s?   Sounds like we must have a people problem.   Let me guess...you think we need more prayer in school and Jesus in our lives.
Both were solid players. Blount was a contributor on a Super Bowl team the next year in a new offense
That happens pretty regularly - if a guy is going to take a pay cut a lot of them use it as a chance to just start fresh somewhere new. It’s no different than the corporate world - a lot of people would rather be fired or quit than just take a demotion and stay   Plenty of guys have been cut from teams that could have still used their talent and then contributed elsewhere, it’s just a question of role/usage/pay
His pay cut would’ve been an absurd drop for what his deal was. Good players are let go all the time. That’s a stupid scope to use for this
Yeah that's totally fine. Our short run game sucks ass. Plus he has reliable hands for a dump off and great pass blocking. He would fit here as it's pretty damn perfect depending on the contract
No, im praying for his blocking. My original comment is assuming we draft RB. Mixon is a horrible pass blocker, and we let Perine walk. I’d rather draft a great RB and use Zeke for pass blocking (where he is still elite by RB standards) than try to draft a pass blocking RB
He may get run over a dozen times a game, but he’s got that dawg on him
And data would show they likely wouldn't win a Superbowl if they did it. Instead get a cheap back and draft a player in day 2 the way most Superbowl winning teams do.
Joe Mixon killed Jon-Benet Ramsey.
Everyone with a driver's license
a law stating its illegal to disrupt the flow of traffic and any incidents caused would be the slow drivers fault
Seriously what is going through their heads when they do this?  I can't even begin to think that small, I just don't get it.
He can go kick rocks, too
Probably a coaching staff and front office as well. Maybe even a training staff
I'm gonna be disappointed if they don't cut him.  Don't really know what to expect from the front office, even with all the stupid crap he's done off the field.
Post june 1 saves them cap this year but costs them next year. And they have plenty of cap this year. So they don't HAVE to save cap. It saves them this year but cost them more next. If he's not playing on my team this year I'd rather eat the cap hit in 23 with the amount of large contracts they have coming up.  Besides, they could easily cut him today with a post June 1 designation. Off the field stuff aside, he's simply not good enough to warrant the salary he's getting this year.
A player designated for a June 1st cut is cut, and can look for and sign with a new team immediately once designated. The team just wouldn't get the cap relief that comes from cutting the player until June 1st. The player isn't trapped waiting for June 1st to roll around.
Edit: ignore me. I definitely had the details wrong. My apologies.
I agree,  he did but as a white man, I can’t say how I’d react to having derogatory names thrown my reaction. I’m not saying it’s justified to do what he did and has done, I’ve just never been put into a situation like that.
Disclaimer: it's a he said she said.   THAAAT being said, I feel like I would tend to side with the individuals trying to hide and avoid confrontation than the one who looks like he is shouting across the cafe and invaded their space.
It absolutely did, he was cat calling her and she ignored him, he persisted so her friend started to defend her. Mixon followed them, calling her derogatory names and calling her friend a gay slur, continues following her into that restaurant where he got into her face again and you see what happens in the video. All because he couldn't handle rejection.
Also no one has accused her of saying anything racist. At best if you believe his side, the guy she was with did after he said homophobic slurs. So naturally he sucker punches the woman and breaks her face.
0 sacks allowed? He’s had an amazing career as a center. 1 QB pressure isn’t that much. 0 holding calls, 0 penalties at all. Better than Jason Kelce confirmed.
They can cut him right now and designate him a post-June 1 closing, there is 0 requirement they actually keep him on the roster until June 1. They just don't want to cut him yet.
You mean how we already announced John Johnson’s post June 1st cut? We didn’t that back in February. The team can announce it now. They just won’t for some reason.
More like it was stupid for a fan base who has defended and supported Mixon, long before Watson arrived in Cleveland, to suddenly pretend like they have moral high ground.
> who has ever said she deserved it?  Well, the Bengals fan right below you, for one.
lol one of your fans just replied in this very thread saying the girl put her hands on him, your fans just can't resist defending him.
I didn't even have to go back to the old threads, one of your fans just decided to just give me a new example... 😂  https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/12epalk/dehner_joe_mixon_being_recharged_by_police/jfcci12?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button   ... apparently she put her hand on him twice, how dare she try to get this guy to leave her alone as he followed her and kept harassing her.  He's also unaware of the time Mixon was accused of assaulting a girl in HS:  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2704570-joe-mixon-alleged-hs-assault-on-female-reportedly-investigated-by-2-nfl-teams  Edit: Cincy fans don't defend Mixon and blame the woman? Check this guy out  https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/12epalk/dehner_joe_mixon_being_recharged_by_police/jfcjoqb/
We've always cared, which is why so many of us were against the Watson signing that has permanently fractured our fan base. What is new is the Cincy fans who consistently defended Mixon pretending like they ever cared about women.
https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2704570-joe-mixon-alleged-hs-assault-on-female-reportedly-investigated-by-2-nfl-teams  Accused by a girl in HS, have video of him punching the girl in college, and now threatening a woman with a gun. Sorry that's only "menacing" and yes traffic must be bad in Cincy, totally justified right?
That was already acknowledged before you even replied to me, but thanks for chiming in. I also wasn't the only one confused at first which of the two Mixon related incidents this was referring to, at first, but man we're long past that. I have no qualms with you unless you're here to tell us all why the women are really to blame. You can see the other two clowns in the thread here, they are the problem with your fan base, not you IMO.
It's Joe Mixon, that's why people are commenting and Browns fans are certainly not the only fan base here commenting, nice try though.
You're still here with me, and I managed to make an entire 3 course dinner while I've been perusing reddit, what are you up to? Still just trying to deflect Mixon attention? Cool. Cool.
It's not a few Bengals fans, that's revisionist history and many have been supporting him ever since he's been drafted. It's not like this is his first offense. Those same fans bashing Watson is pretty rich.
It's fun that we got to interact on the thread that spelled the end of Joe's career in Cincy...or at least you better hope it does after this latest incident. I love Joe Burrow, Chase is probably the best WR after JJetta, and I have several lifelong friends from Cincy. They all agree Mixon is a shitstain just like we all hate Watson. You just can't separate your fandom from your moral code enough to realize Joe Mixon isn't worth going to bat for.
No kidding. It's disgusting, and this is the first I remember hearing about it.
Yeah, sure. I never said he'd be a bad fit. He is good at pass pro, good in short yardage, and can catch passes. I was just adding to what op said because often he appears to pick the wrong hole, when in reality he chose the correct hole, but didn't have the burst to break through before it closes so he gets 2/3 yards when 2018 Zeke would've gotten 15/20.
Joe Mixon waved a gun at a girl from his car....Damnit.....
Yeah because he stinks
With Jimmy's shady ass wed have a pos owner as well.
It spreads the same amount over 2 years which actually is a better value since the cap goes up every year except for 2020. It's the smart business decision. Keeping him doesn't hurt them at all. It's not like he's playing.
They could also wait until the draft happens, reevaluate their team with the players they just acquired, allow other teams to do the same and potentially open up more trade opportunities, and then still cut him pre- or post-June 1st.  The Bengals aren't in a rush to finalize their roster during the first week of April. Unless there's an explicit benefit to them cutting him pre-draft, why would they bother?
they are designated for a june first cut. Meaning they are actually cut June 1st. Im sure he knows that he's getting cut anyways, but he should focus on his case before looking for a different team imo. He can look for a new team right now, I dont know why the Bengals wont just announce it when they're already looking for a rb replacement.
There's a whole lot of things on a scale of walking away and breaking someone's face.
Lol how are these same lies still being posted by Bengals fans?  The video was literally released showing him following her into the restaurant. Harassing her and her friend and then hitting her when she got in his face. Does Cincinnati not have YouTube or something?
It doesn't matter what color you are. You always have the option to completely remove yourself from the situation.
He punched her after she pushed and slapped him. It wasn't because her friend said something to him. [Video](https://youtu.be/G5wIj7LbslY)  That's not to say he still shouldn't have just walked away. He shouldn't have even followed them in in the first place.
This is true, but the Bengals rarely cut anyone, and even more rarely before the draft.   It's just how they operate.
jjiii was good why'd you cut him. Also Bengals fo definitely just dont care, possibly cut him after his trial or just keep waiting until June
There are far more doing the opposite lmao. I'd say get off your high horse but then it wouldn't be Reddit.
You can't find 5 people and be like yep, thats the Bengals fanbase. Pretty sure if you looked hard enough you could even find a few bad people in Denmark, it's hard to keep them out.   Browns fan saying "you've been supporting Mixon" to a guy that just said "rich coming from a Browns fan." He didn't say he supported Mixon and the Bengals fanbase doesn't either. The Bengals guy further in the thread gets downvoted for a reason
I understand everything Mixon did and dont like him, like the majority of our fanbase. It's like pulling up pictures of Browns fans wearing "Happy endings aren't illegal" shirts and saying this represents Cleveland.   Other guy said it's rich for a Browns fan to come after Mixon as if they don't also get mad about being generalized as rape sympathizers. If you don't like being generalized then now why would you go and generalize others lol
so some browns fans can be against the watson signing but EVERY single bengals fan is supporting mixon?
Did you even bother reading he article you just linked?   > A pair of NFL teams are reportedly looking into a since-recanted allegation that former Oklahoma Sooners running back Joe Mixon assaulted a girl when he was in high school   > After Rapoport's report, Hernandez's lawyer Blake Johnson gave Florio a statement from his client in which he said in part: "I do not believe Joe ever did anything to hurt my daughter."  > “Once, when they were in school together, my daughter had a minor disagreement with some of her classmates that got blown out of proportion. Like any father would, I reacted emotionally. Unfortunately, I did so before I had all the facts. Now, having talked to my daughter and investigated the whole story, I realize that I was mistaken about Joe’s involvement. I definitely overreacted, and I regret that my words might have given some people the wrong impression about Joe. I know that Joe did not hurt my daughter, did not intend to, and would not do so.”  So we have one confirmed incident on video, where once again, you left out the part where she escalated the situation first and put her hands on him twice. And two allegations, one of which was recanted. And you’re telling people he’s assaulted 3 women? Nice alternative reality you live in. Maybe take a page out of the dads playbook and quit reacting emotionally without the facts.
I’ve never heard any accusations about Kareem hunt. Who you’ve conveniently forgotten about. WAYYY before Deshaun Watson. So keep telling me how we’re the ones on moral high horses
Lol you’re soooo close to getting what I’m trying to say. Keep going and I think you’ll get there
There isn't really revesitionist history going on. In reality his first incident was when he was 18 and until this year he has shown to be an upstanding citizen and a positive force in the community. The incident at his house was not him being a bad person in the slightest and the "revisionism" around the event was because the reporting on it was horrible and different false things came out including the original report which every other fan base jumped on when it said joe mixon shot someone which he did not.  That being said, the road rage incident is not a good look but im not going to say he is an awful person for a situation none of us actually have any facts about at this point.
[removed]
But then Joe Mixon shot Pac. And Biggie. And my friends Scooby and Deeter.
I'm sorry that my team's sexual assault miscreant isn't good like yours was? Lol, go eat dirt
And with Baltimore as a fanbase we could even have criminal fans.
I understand it spreads it out over 2 years. But why spread it over 2 years when you can afford it now? Especially when you have very large expenses upcoming.
Oh dang I never saw that. You got the video? I only ever saw the original like 10-15 second video which looked like she spit on him and everyone in the comments claiming she called him the N word.
We cut him for a couple reasons. We needed cap room, he wasn’t playing up to his contract, and he was playing out of position (which most likely factored into why he wasn’t playing well). Joe Woods wanted him to play center field for some reason but he’s better as a box safety
My original comment said "What happened to **the** Bengals fans",  I did not say *ALL Bengals fans.* You're projecting here my friend. I then replied to a fan saying nobody supporting Cincy is defending Mixon, when we all know that isn't true, and provided the link to the men's rights guy from your fan base actively still posting about how Mixon punching that girl was just respecting her as an equal.... It was rich for the portion of your fan base that defends Mixon to come after us for Watson, they are the hypocrites.
No, that's the point of calling out the hypocrisy in attacking all Browns fans...you see that now? In this very thread there are Cincy fans still trying to downplay the Mixon punch and blame the girl for touching him. I think it's just amazing how for over a year, people just flair attack anyone with a Browns flair in this sub and make the same massage jokes, etc thinking we all supported Watson...yet Cincy fans come out and brigade the Mixon posts to claim Mixon was out of town for an incident, he apologized and was a model citizen after the college assault caught in video (while also claiming the girl instigated it), and now one of your top up voted fan comments in this thread is saying this road rage one understandable because traffic is bad in Cincy.  You don't have to attack me when you can attack them. I mean our fan base had no problem going at it with each other over Watson, yet we ALL get the hate anytime we post anything to this sub.
Ah yes, totally shocked a star athlete was able to wiggle his way out of that charge in a small town where he was the King Fish. That's never happened before, and his behavior since then certainly shouldn't make us question Joe, we definitely discredit the women who keep accusing him. Classic reply.  Thanks for providing more exhibit A evidence again, some of your other fans were claiming your vase guys doesn't defend Mixon at all.
Hunt came to the Browns long after Mixon was drafted by Cincy, and if you'd like to compare Hunt to Mixon, please play those videos side by side and try to tell me with a straight face they were on the same level. I'll wait.
You're projecting, this story is about Mixon and you were attempting to change the subject Watson, and I'm not someone who defends Watson. So you're not making the point you thought you were.
The facts are he was just charged, which means they feel there's enough evidence to indict. You're also ignoring his past while bringing up he was young when one of the incidents happened...as if he's learned from his mistakes when recent events clearly show otherwise.
[removed]
I’m saying that if Carmen was an all pro your fan base would want him on the team.
Derrick Henry was 25th
Great "remember some guys" list. Isaiah Crowell's lunchables thing was fun
Crazy to think that Frank Gore isn't on any rosters such a short time later
There’s actually been very few running backs in NFL history that have been great for 6+ years. There’s like 30 or less running backs that have had more than 5 1,000 yard seasons. Nobody has accomplished this feat since Marshawn got his 6th 1,000 yard year in 2014, nearly a decade ago. Henry and Chubb both have a pretty good chance of hitting this milestone though.   Teams are catching onto the idea that running backs have a shorter life span than ever in the NFL, and they’re adjusting accordingly; draft them and run them into the ground before you have to pay them. You can always buy another year with the franchise tag, which is relatively cheap for RBs.
Derrick Henry is. And Hunt, latavius Murry, and zeke will probably be.
“None of them are on an NFL roster anymore”   Yeah uhh quite a few of them will be before the season starts.
I wonder if this is why NFL GMs are reluctant to give out larger contracts to running backs
There needs to be a positional rookie wage scale, it’s unfair to RBs that the bulk of their career production comes before they’ll ever get an NFL payday. Which fine, to an extent that’s just the market doing its thing but give it long enough and nobody would want to play RB.
That is a great stat to show what a shitty position it is and they should get paid accordingly.
That tracks with what we know about NFL RB lifespans.  That said, isn't Kareem Hunt going to be on a roster this season?  I know he currently isn't, but...Then again 1 out of 25 isn't much better than 0 out of 25.
Any Baltimore fans care to explain what happened to Alex Collins? I had him in fantasy the year he had 900+ yards and thought he always looked explosive, but they never seemed to trust him and then he completely fell off.
Ooof, back in 2019 Crowell had just signed a one year deal with the Raiders. He would tear his Achilles a couple months later. Definitely a what could of been.
How does this compare with other stats-leaders from the same season? Receiving yards, tackles, sacks, etc.?
orleans darkwa lol
Incredibly shocked all these "RBs are not valuable" remarks are getting up voted (not because they're untrue, but because that's not my experience)
RB’s should be paid significantly higher on rookie deals considering how much value they bring right out of the gate. Or at least only be put on a 1-2 year prove it deal after being drafted.
Looking at the top passing and receiving leaders too, all I take from this is 6 years is an eternity in the NFL
6 years is a long time for NFL careers in general
5 years is like half the life if not more span for most starting RBs  Gurley knees were depreciated using an accelerated method
How many "RBs are not a valuable position and shouldn't be paid accordingly" circle jerk posts does this sub need?
Okay, now look at receiving yard leaders.  https://www.nfl.com/stats/player-stats/category/receiving/2017/REG/all/receivingyards/DESC  Maybe 5 of these 25 are players that still matter.  Wow, I guess receivers aren't worth paying.
Real Crow Hoes know
I just want people to remember the glory days of TGIII, simple man.
"Only 6 years"
Kareem hunt and latavius Murray will be on a roster by week 4 at the latest
Yeah, he’s definitely still on a roster. And Ezekiel Elliott will almost certainly be on one by the time the season starts.
I'll never forget the r/NFL thread where people pretty much universally agreed Derrick Henry was a bust and then he ripped off a few 200-yard games in a row and never looked back
[Tha crow is coming!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2GMcjNyAyI)
“A Feast for Crowells” is one of the all time fantasy team names
And that he's a asshat
Also, Dalvin Cook was fucking shit up for the first month of 2017 before getting hurt.
True. But they ey’re all going to be playing off 1 year league minimum contracts. Some of them might be training camp cuts, except for Henry.
I noticed the same.
5 years is an eternity in the nfl.
Kind of insane to think about how GMs in the 80s were making RBs the highest paid players in the league.
This is why Le’veon wasn’t wrong for chasing the bag
Well it’s a shitty position cuz there miles add up quicker compared to any other position. So they should get paid accordingly to their production, but that coincides with the rookie scale wage usually.   I am in favor of the rookie scale wage but it does seem to screw running backs the most.
"Paid accordingly," meaning what exactly? Higher salary on shorter contracts?   Right now there's no incentive for teams to do anything other than run a dude into the ground and draft his replacement before the rookie contract expires.
Melvin Gordon, Zeke Elliott, Leonard Fournette, and Latavius Murray likely make rosters as well.
Hunt, Zeke, and Fournette will all be on rosters.  Derrick Henry *is* on a roster and he's on this list.  Dalvin Cook tore his ACL otherwise he'd have made this list.  This list also doesn't include receptions, in which case you'd have seen guys like CMC and Kamara make the cut.  The lifespan of RBs is definitely short, but this chart *does* leave out some context.
everyone got burnt out on the Lamar stories since nothing's going to happen for awhile, the Mac Jones stories didn't take off at all.  Gotta find something to fill the offseason with.
Sorry but we are only interested in cherry picking data to fit a narrative.
So will Hunt and Fournette
I'll own up to my bad takes of insisting Derrick Henry was a slightly taller Andre Williams.
Eddie George shamed him into stardom lol
I mean he was a bust until the end of 2018. Titans even shopped him at the trade deadline that year and no one wanted him. He lost his battle for the starting role to Dion Lewis for the first half of 2018. Dude needed to get it together, and he did.
There will never be a better hype video.
Fuck U Pay Me
lmao
For anyone who doesn't know, he dragged a woman across a hotel floor.
Okay, so then "none of them" is inaccurate and misleading
Other than the area where you were wrong, you were right.   👏
So it's an inaccurate and dumb statement
Noted retiree *checks notes* Kareem Hunt
Also a lot of these guys were already old
Yea when you switch over to receiving it’s better but it’s still full of guys who are washed/retired
You really have to think “I am the best at the world at something, and my career is 4-6 years”, that would suck.
If a scoring with a running back was more than 6 points, that would increase their value. If the running back got a 100 yds in a game, their team would get an added point (conditionally) like draft picks. Maybe running backs should put into future contracts not to be used more than 25% of the offenses plays or they get a bonus. If there are 75 offensive plays on average in a game, having one running back get more than 19 attempts should include a bonus. Just brainstorming
I don't know about Gordon.  I feel like Zeke is either on the Cowboys or maybe he starts as a free agent.  Playoff Lenny will probably get a spot.  I didn't realize that in terms of ypc, this was Latavius Murray's second or third best season.
I think Fred Taylor was around for a long time, too
It’s pretty safe to say Elliott, Hunt and Fournette are near the end of their careers. They will all likely be playing on one year contracts and it’s not unfathomable that none of them will be on a roster in a year. Henry is the exception but let’s hope the RB Father Time doesn’t catch up to him too quickly.
Personally love this one tho.   https://youtu.be/G4ndiOAg0gI
We call that a Rice-ing.
I guess I was, sorry.
I like how you’re repeating what the other two people are saying several hours to make yourself seem smart. Lmao and I already apologize fam hop off my sack please.
Saying that being a multi million dollar athlete equating to slavery is only "a stretch" is certainly a sentence
Who are these people?  What?
Yeah they’re basically porn stars
These changes are radical so people here might not like them but I think they're cool. Toss in another: different (higher) rookie pay scale for RBs
Murray is a solid depth piece. I’d bet he gets signed somewhere. He is getting up there in age tho tbh
Zeke was better than fournette this year lol    Fournette was cheeks this season
I think that if Hunt goes to a team that wants to feature him he could still do okay. He's been the clear second back to Chubb for several years now so he doesn't have the mileage on him that Zeke and Lenny do.
Well sure but I’m just saying they’ll still be on a roster somewhere. Even if it’s at RB2/3 they’ll still find a team
Just saw this post and pointing out that it was dumb, that's all
Lisa Ann: the frank gore of pornstars
I think this would be the easiest to do, but I think it might make RB’s even less likely to be drafted though if you have to pay them more than someone else you could draft in the same spot
Zeke was.  Doesn't mean people won't give him a chance at least in camp because the Bucs sucked as a whole.
And at worst Zeke is an extra lineman, someone will sign him because he can block
Hunt is no longer a feature back. He used to plow through guys like the Tasmanian Devil, but now he gets driven backwards. He's not the guy he was even two years ago
Sure man I believe you
> Regular people have jobs making $100k for 50 years on average, and are probably better off than a $5 mil back up in the NFL for 3 years.  It’s not like NFL players just can’t work after their career, or invest, etc. They very easily can make more money than an average person just by having a $5 Million head start
Dawg. You're like 18 and have no clue what your talking about lol. These dudes can be out of the league in 3 years. Have a million plus in the bank and have a gigantic head start on the rest of the working class. Slavery? More like winning the lottery even as a 7th round pick.
*Frank Gore: the Lisa Ann of RBs.
I heard he cross positions as center
Maybe.
Yes, because I need validation.
He has no problem going up against defenders, one bad snap doesn’t mean anything he had great blocks last season
I watched him with my own two eyes. He has noticeably slowed down. The only game he looked good in was Halloween against the Bengals. He cannot handle the workload of a feature back. His vision and speed was much worse this year. He used to break tackles, but now he goes backwards and takes tackles for loss. He's still decent in pass protection and catching the ball, so he can probably be a 3rd down back for the right team. Hell, if the price is right, I wouldn't mind him back as long as the plan is for him to be RB3 on the depth chart
Perhaps.
Everything alright brother?
The two teams with the hardest *adjusted* strengths of schedule in 2008, and it wasn't even close. Every other team with one of the 10 hardest schedules that season finished with double-digit losses.
One of the most hard hitting brutal games I’ve seen. It almost feels like this game happened in the 70s with how different things are today.
Things I learned today.   The 2008 AFC championship was filmed using the same cameras as the 1978 AFC championship.     Or at least it seems that way.
This was true Steelers-Ravens football. It was always do or die for both teams
One of the best to ever do it
AFC North in the postseason is always must-watch television.
Saw the words "2008...pick 6...Steelers...Super Bowl" and instinctively prepared myself to leap into oncoming traffic.
But but but our last Lombardi trophy has less dust on it than the Steelers last one
I’m biased, and obviously not happy with the outcome, but I truly believe this type of football is gone from the NFL forever. This game was an absolute bar fight, and was the true Super Bowl of the 2008 season. This was also the beginning of the golden era of the Ravens-Steelers rivalry.
Jesus dude. This is still the most painful playoff loss to me. Don't talk to me about 2011. It was against our most hated rival and we fucking went back and forth with the defenses killing everybody (RIP Willis). The season was so amazing after Billick got canned after 2007 but ended in injuries and heartbreak.
I remember being a kid and seeing a magazine with this play on the cover at my doctor’s office. I adored Troy - this play mattered more to me than the super bowl
Somehow that reminds me of the playoff divisional game when the refs took a beautiful Polamalu Interception away from him against the Colts.  That was some major bullshit. Peyton had that golden whistle for a number of years.
Thank you for helping me to get through this Friday
The wind was cold on the confluence that day my friend and no amount of IC Light helped. As soon as that game kicked off though, the weather was forgotten and the day was simply perfect.
I remember having a knot in my stomach every time these two teams faced off in this era.   Always a banger. Didn't matter if there was a backup starting.
That dude was crazy on defense
Gosh, TP was such a beast on the field. Miss watching him make splash plays like this every game!
If you watch him pre-snap, he barely moved. He didn't have to do his usual crazy wizardry to get this one. So my question is:  If you're Joe Flacco, HOW do you not know where Polamalu is lined up before the snap? 🤔
Man, he was so fun to watch
79 is looking like the slowest man alive. He knew there was 0 chance he’s catching Troy but still giving that token effort.
Troy’s premonition ability for getting to the ball was magic to behold
Why does this video quality make it look like 1988 though lol?
Hell yeah those Ravens and Steelers defenses were insane.  The Texans had a hard time against them but we did have that one classic in 2011 beating the Steelers. 19 play 10 minute opening drive for a touchdown. Our o line was next level that year and Arian Foster was playing at his absolute peak.  https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/311002034  We also lost to the Ravens in our first playoff berth that year.
Jim Nantz was way more reserved back then.   Being with Tony Romo has really loosened him up.
I mean I get that it put the Steelers up 9 but there's still four and a half minutes left; hardly seems like you could call it a done deal at the time.
Was this the same yeah that why to the Superbowl against the Cardinals?
Imagine if a Falcons fan posted 28-3 highlights
Where the refs happily handed them a SB bc the Bus deserved at least one ring.
That was such a boring game. Ravens offense could hardly move the football all game long. Even when they were down by 2 at that point during the game, I never felt confident that they were gonna go down and score and win the game.
Wow what a call by the play-by-play!
I miss the afc north from back then. It was so competitive and the games were fun to watch.
That's gotta be the most low effort run I've ever seen from 79
Troy was so damn good. And then when we played the Ravens he was just next level. They may have had Ray and Ed but Troy always rose to the occasion and crushed Baltimore hearts.
It's such a shame that Phil Simms has called so many iconic games. The 2000's and 2010's had so many exciting games only to be ruined by his terrible commentating.
He was so fun to watch. Not so much in the head and shoulders commercials.
Polamalu was such a mensch. It's amazing that we got to see two safeties as generationally talented as Polamalu and Reed play at the same time.
I own the dapper NFT of this. I know stupid.
My top 3 Steelers-Ravens game!
My favorite part of this clip will always be Jim Nantz‘a diction deteriorating with each pronunciation of the word “Polamalu.”
I don’t really like Romo, however Jim Nantz was such a boring play by play until Romo was his partner. He literally sounds like AI generated in these old clips.
Idk what happened, someone snuck a terrible towel into my food and now my mind is all discombobulated
I would feel bad for Ravens fans, but they did go through an epic run, what, four years after this? No, didn't beat your biggest Rivals, but the Ravens did go through two hall of famers.  /u/Ravenshaven23 needs to post clips of that Ravens run tomorrow.
Yeah but you guys each had two free wins against us that year.  Which actually means your sos was even harder lol.
And us with a rookie head coach and QB
I miss the Steelers Ravens games from this time.
I knew I wasn't the only one who noticed how terrible the quality is.
My dad was a Steelers fan so I watched a ridiculous number of mid-late 2000s Steelers-Ravens games. Incredible defensive performances every single time
His niece was my coworker, and she was the biggest bitch I’ve ever met.  Greatness runs in the family.
Tom Brady is the best to do it
I don’t like either of these teams but you’re correct 100% of the time.
Oh yeah? Well we have more of them, take that!
I don't even know what an AFC Championship appearance is anymore, let alone a SB appearance.
This was the beginning of the “peak” of the golden era
Yep.  Watching that play live I was like yep that's an interception.  They they go to the booth review and I'm like there's no way they gonna let Peyton lose a playoff game with an int.  So I was prepared for them to overturn.  Very bs call.
Peyton had the golden whistle up until his very last game...
Was at the Steelers Bill's game where we beat yall and Troy had the end zone int at the end to seal it. Bills fans were GIVING it to Troy all game. Chirping. Mocking. One dude kept trying to tell people in the section not to poke the bear. Troy made the inty and buddy stood up and screamed "I fucking told you idiots to leave him alone" lol.
Rookie
Wrong year. 08 was against the Cards
Boring game?  A dude got knocked out cold on the opening kickoff.  How is that boring?  It was one of the most physical, hard-hitting, playoff games ever played.
Its interesting because we moved the ball a lot better vs Pittsburgh in our first two games that year, but the AFC championship is a different beast.   I'm more surprised our defense played as well as they did with our two starting corners (Chris McCalister and Samari Roller) out. Our defense gave us a legit chance at the end, and Flacco had a long completion to Todd Heap before this play.    I remembered thinking we were gonna drive down like the week before vs Tennessee to kick the game winner and go to the Super Bowl, but this play flushed that down the toilet.
Be careful.  Next you'll be eating french fries on a salad, and go to weddings of people you don't even know just to check out the cookie table.    It's too late for some of us, but you can still save yourself!
Yea it was pretty crazy. First round against the Colts (lots of hate there), then peyton who had basically owned the Ravens, then tom brady and revenge for the previous year's playoff exit, and finally the Super Harbowl.
Also didn’t have to face Brady that year
i for one do not miss this era of the ravens or steelers
Me too man, what was great about them is there was almost always something big on the line. Either division championship or in the case conference championship the games were always important.
I don’t need that week long anxiety anymore.
This game looked better before I got glasses
Agreed. That wouldn’t make what I said untrue.
Best Strong Safety of all time Tom Brady
Average Boston resident
Tom Brady, GOAT safety.
You guys still won though right?
Juvenile dragon
You’re right I thought it said 05 at first glance. It was still a poorly reefed game in the favor of the Steelers just not as blatant.
This game rules, even though my team was on the losing side.
Tomlin loves games like this
French fries on salad is so good though
That blown secondary play by the Broncos on Flacco’s bomb was probably the worst play of all time by a safety in big spot.
Neither did any other team.
Would you give this being Bengals vs one of Steelers / Ravens without a Super Bowl guarantee but no Joe Burrow?
Just making conversation
Wait, that's Deshaun Watson's music!
Smartest Patriots fan
They can't read?
So do I.  They're great.
And things of that nature.
This is actually a thing? Where?
No way I'd take that deal
Terrible conversation lol
Wicked smaht
I always throw it together myself at restaurants that serve fries and have a side salad
I can’t believe this about Harry styles and Emily ratajokowski
My wife was shocked
Wtf is even the connection here
Brock Purdy and Jimmy G being so close is wild
THE GEQBUS PROVES AGAIN THAT HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE STARTER OVER PATHETIC PJ AND THE BUMBLING BAFFOON BAKER
Niners make this an all time classic graph
That Tua to Skylar drop off is nuts
Jesus Christ Skylar lmao
Pat Mahomes
No Teddy B?
Proof Sam Darnold is better than Burrow
Zappe is qb1
Sam darnold seems high..
Uh Minshew isn’t there despite playing 3 games
Pretty sure Malik Willis is well under the x-axis.
purdy good
So does this help prove that not any qb can just be plugged into Mia and have success. The Tua-Skylar gap is huge and it seems that means Teddy probably fell off the chart, lol.
The most surprising thing to me is how low Herbert is here. I know there are factors like a terrible OC and injuries, but I still thought he'd be higher.
TopMiddleTua?
Nooooo Tua is only good cause his team how can Skylar and teddy be so low 😡
I wish we could just count all of the QBs not named Justin Fields for the Bears, because 2 of them played the Vikings backups and it was still hot garbage
I will miss Mike White
Brissett clears the sex offender.
Wilson over Flacco is surprising…
Carson Went
Baker Mayfield outperformed Stafford on the Rams and underperformed Darnold on the Panthers.  Amazing what a difference coaching makes   More amazing that Matt Rhule wasn’t fired last season
Baker better than Stafford but worse than darnold confirmed
I refuse to believe Kenny and Mitch played equally well for the Steelers.
Jimmy G was doing well with CMC. CMC seemingly did wonders for their offensive efficiency
Nah dude Brock Purdy is a superstar and Jimmy G is barely above average; Get with the program.
I stand by Jimmy G being a really good QB who is viewed as mid because of injuries, non-highlight reel playstyle, and a big contract.
Even more wild is they traded up to 3 to take Lance and can scheme up the other 2 at QB pretty damn well.
Same for Trubisky and Pickett.
I think this should make more people realize that EPA / play is more of a team stat than just a QB stat.
Also Wentz and Heinicke
Interesting thing is Jimmy was passing 2019 level of Jimmy. On pace for his best season honestly.
wasn't darnold hurt until the end of the year?
And yet we almost won a playoff game with Skylar lmfao
And he almost beat us! After that game I was pretty much resigned to the fact that the Bengals were going to smoke us.
need a new subreddit for "/r/topmiddlemahomes"
Not top right so thats a W for the rest of the league
Henne outperformed everybody so much that they had to exclude him to make the graph readable
Teddy Bridgewater? More like Teddy Dogwater 🤢  All jokes aside, he was *somehow* ~~worse~~ less efficient than skylar, and you can see how big the drop-off is from Tua to Skylar.
You have to keep scrolling down to find his name.
I assume he didn't reach the snap count? Idk
Name checks out
He was that bad I guess
Jimmy just as good
I said we should get Mariota as backup and run a gimmick offense of Tua goes down because I’m not convinced any backup has the minimum anticipation and accuracy required to run this offense semi-competently.
Trubisky on that fins roster is winning minimum 5 super bowls. TruGOATsky
Herbert is overrated but god forbid you bring that up on this sub
Only middle cause it’s alphabetical order. He deserves his TopRight!!
Jimmy was doing well before cmc.   Jimmy was playing like a legit top 10 qb before his injury
I definitely started touting them as superbowl favorites a few games after that trade lol
The biggest differences between the two was Brock taking the big shots when Jimmy would check it down.  Edit: I’m not putting one above the other. Both had 4:1 TD:int and any/a of 8.4  Brock put some juice on the game with his scrambling that Jimmy hasn’t done since 2017.
well, one entered the season at 22 years old with less than a year in the system (and no nfl experience) and the other is 31 years old with 5 plus years in the system and a decade of nfl experience
We are also comparing a 10Y vet to some rookie that was picked last a year ago. Brock Purdy was a much bigger difference maker in the game if you watched it. He averaged over 30 PPG when taking over
Brock Purdy was the scout team QB for half the season, had minimal reps with the ones if any all year.   Comes in and out plays the guy that's been there for 4 years with the first team and goes undefeated.   Obviously the same thing wouldn't have happened if he was starting for the Texans, but he had a legit year.
Yeah and Lance never even suited up for them this regular season (at least, I think, I remember him being injured in the preseason)
I didn't even notice that bc they're so close
Pickett had a pretty poor start, but post bye week was 4th in epa/play in that time frame so he ended on a significantly positive note
While I agree with you.  I think it does show elite qbs being elite in the case of some teams.
There's some truth to that, but the majority of points on that chart that suggest there can be a big difference between one QB and the next even on the same team.
It was a conspiracy by the DEEP LEAGUE to keep the GEQBUS from WINNING TOO MUCH
*Still* blown away by burning not one but **two** critical timeouts instead of taking the 5 yards for delay of game.
We kept giving them short fields.  But yeah the team looked like they were ready to head home.
Trade him to the Commanders!
Turdy Buttwater is what I’ve been calling him since his panthers stint
He did 141 snaps but 79 passes. The graph says snaps but might mean passes
he's pretty good, yes. decent. i want to see how he looks without shanahan.
People bring it up all the time though?
I don't know why he can't just be a very good QB instead of people trying to push him as a bona fide top-5 or even top-3 QB.  He's good, not great (yet).
I think you just described Jimmy’s career
Trey Lance will take more deep shots, and he’ll be much better than Brock
Having 0 film is an advantage
One had Christian Mccaffrey
Trey Lance is the starter next year.
He had a legit couple of games. Not year.
He played like 1 or 2 games, game 1 wasnt the best but was played in a literal monsoon    Injured early game 2 iirc
That’s going to be the case for a ton of Steelers stats - they played a brutal schedule going into the bye and a much easier stretch to end the season.
Username checks out for finding that worth sharing
I was gonna say I swear I’ve read “Jimmy G was playing well until his injury” 10 times every single offseason
If you took every pass attempt from Trey Lance’s HS, college and NFL career and combined them, it’s less attempts than Brady had last season.
Well he’s gotta play and finish more than 1 game in a row.
inexperience and not repping with the ones before week 8 are disadvantages
both had christian mccaffrey
For like 2-4 weeks. Even then, its not guaranteed that he will be better than Darnold. I am really looking forward to see how Trey has progressed in the early part of the year, ideally Trey hits his ceiling and we are looking at a top 10 QB. I just don’t want to get my hopes up, you know?  Also, wtf is your flair man
Didn't lose a single game he had all his ligaments intact.  Pretty legit if you ask me.
Oh ok. I knew it was super early on
THIS!   Seriously, why are so many people just ignoring this? I want Kenny (or rather the entire team) to succeed too, but let's not get ahead of ourselves.
Flair checks out for bringing even less to the conversation
Bills fans get brain damage from jumping through tables  We get brain damage because the sun literally cooks our brain cells  We are not the same 😤
Okay? Im sure Shanahan will take that into consideration when Lance is named the starter next season
He did. Unfortunately one of them was in a monsoon where the field was so fucked the white lines weren’t straight anymore. I cant believe people actually hold that one against him.  It’s not like this dude has played a full season and sucked, and it’s not like he’s had tons of injuries. Kyle Shanahan has a vision of an unstoppable offense, and it isn’t with Brock Purdy.
Ok but purdy isn't as cute as Jimmy g, defenders weren't trying to touch him like they desire to with jimmy
Only 1 had him for every start in his career
I had multiple dads growing up. One was a vikings fan and another was a packers fan, so i had to support both or else i’d get beat up by my 3rd dad
Great backup to have for Trey Lance
Who woulda thought someone named after farting would be so uptight
I’m not holding that against him. I didn’t even bring him up. You did.
no one is, to be fair
...this chart is only referring to this season though? jimmy had cmc for 5 starts and brock also had cmc for 5-6 starts in the regular season  i don't get this narrative that jimmy didn't have cmc or whatever   if you want to argue that cmc was still "learning the system" with jimmy and brock benefitted from cmc acclimating by the time he was thrown into the game, well, that's a different argument
Fair enough. Just looks weird, reasoning checks out though.
Compare his 8 game stretch to any other rookie in NFL history, tell me which one played better.    And this was with out any first team reps.
Trey Lance is the ‘9ers starting QB. Brock Purdy does not have any potential. Have a nice day man.
Every start of his career vs 5 out of 10 games in one season, where at least 2 of those didn’t have the full playbook available because Mccaffrey was just acquired.   Why am I lecturing you on your own favorite team?
Brock Purdy will be backing up Trey Lance next season.
😂😂😂😂 ok man you too
...brock wasn't playing with the full playbook either, in the beginning. you have to remember that he was the backup to the backup and wasn't expecting to be starting. it's a wash at best.  >why am i lecturing you on your own favorite team?  i don't know, you don't seem to know very much about them
It's definitely possible, he blew out his Ulnar ligament and the recovery time isn't fully know.  But if he's healthy enough to play in the last preseason game he is most definitely the starter.  And you didn't name a rookie in NFL history with a better start to their career....I'll wait for your answer..
Why wouldn’t Brock know the full playbook? You do realize guys are still practicing and should know the playbook even when they aren’t the starter right?
Ah the Daily Snark, very refutable
Click bait.  Speculation by an NFL Insider.
Our last franchise QB was a mountain of a person, we have to see how the opposite works out. For science purposes.
jenniferlawrenceyeaok.gif
[ALL] **Panthers**: dont rush guys  [TEAM] **Panthers**: rush
Daily Snark is the definition of clickbait bullshit.
This is the hardest clickbait I’ve seen on reddit
That’s a great spot for Bryce honestly. That’s been what the panthers have been missing. A great qb.
The Panthers are trying to get the Texans to bite . They hope the Texans will make a trade and the Panthers recoup some picks and still get Stroud .
Daily Snark sucks, but it seems to be a pretty open secret that leaked ~one week ago. Lots of people are firmly sure it’s gonna be Young.   And makes sense, Young is the best QB in the draft.
i too would draft bryce young with the 1st overall pick
Chris Mortensen doesn't report a ton of stories any more, but when he does, they tend to be right
Smoke
CJ Stroud still -333 on sportsbooks. That’s a pretty heavy favorite, and they’re usually right about drafts. Nobody thought Paolo Banchero was going first in the NBA draft last year until suddenly all the books shifted his odds two days before the draft.  I trust them far more than random “journalist” mouthpieces who just say anything they’re told.
Trade Matt Corral already  Dude has all the tools to succeed in the NFL.  He just need a shot
Water is wet
BREAKING: What everyone expected to happen will happen
Bryce will be out of the league in 5 years.....little qbs don't last. Russell Wilson is the exception not the rule. Where is Tyler Murray? Oh yah. Tua can't even finish a full season....small qbs are a huge risk.
I think Young will be good. But I fear he’ll be expected to be great immediately. Be nice if he could sit behind someone for a year or so.
This seems like a very true source
I know he has question marks by his physical limitations. But he does everything else so well that I think you just have to take the risk
The Panthers get their man! What a pick!
Right choice imo
The niners can still grab Jones if they want.
Is this like official?
I mean there is a 50/50 chance on getting it right, might as well throw a guess out there and call it 'inside sources'. If you are wrong, no one will remember.
REPORT: Panthers Will Select Canteee with No. 1 Overall Pick in 2023 NFL Draft
I remember when teams would openly negotiate with their choice for #1 overall. Why are teams so secretive now? Is there a benefit I'm not seeing?
We're in smokescreen country now.
> very refutable  This was not the word you wanted but it still kinda works anyway
There’s been a ton of people all saying the same thing recently. Cat seems out of the bag
MOUNT GEQBUS IS THE BEST, SMARTEST, AND MOST SUCCESSFUL MOUNTAIN OF PERSON EVER!  HIS UNCLE WAS AN EXPERT IN SCIENCE PURPOSES.
I am deeply saddened for Panthers fans that GEQBUS left you guys for the Niners. The fact that you guys gave up the farm to move to #1 to replace him is truly a testament to his greatness.
Swapping from Auburn to Alabama too.
Finally we'll have the answer to the question does size matter?
I want whatever you're smoking if you don't think the Panthers have the pick figured out by now
*Team dies from a tunnel crunch while Matt Rhule is scoped in on long doors from spawn*
Horrible spot for Bryce lol.  Edit:  for the guy who replied to me asking why it’s horrible, your reply got glitched and I cant see it.  So here’s your answer:  This sub, the NFL world, and probably even the Panthers will be seriously questioning how good Bryce Young is a year form now if he’s drafted and asked to succeed throwing to Terrace Marshall, DJ Chark, and Adam Thielen.  All that “top 10 OL and good defense!” stuff is great until you’re being viewed as a replaceable game manager.
That’s all this is
The dude is magic honestly.
I think it's a bait to get Houston to trade up for one so they can move down to 2 and get Stroud who they wanted to anyway
Stroud down to -170, Bryce to +110 now. I still think it’s Stroud though.
Stroud is only favored on sportsbooks because bettors think listing Frank Reich’s QBs heights has any meaning
Like you said the books shifted Banchero’s odds 2 days before the draft, what’s to say they won’t do the same to Bryce Young and propel him to the betting favourite? Vegas has gotta make their money after all..
I do not like your duel flairs. Makes me feel icky.
Ya know, I’m not a Corral “believer” per se, but I do think a team should try to see what he can do. I’ve been thinking about how a trade might look though and I feel like we’ll probably end up just keeping him.   The trade would probably be at most a 6th round pick. 1. We have no “need” for him; 2. He suffered a serious foot injury; 3. In the few games he did play in, he didn’t look very promising; 4. He was the last regimes guy; 5. His injury happened so early that we can’t even leverage that he looked good in practice or anything similar to that.
Cardinals? Let me start while Kyler is out
not according to vegas
Id take Bryce over stroud honestly. The dude makes plays. He just needs to beef up a bit.
No
There have been several posts discussing this but yes. Other teams not knowing our plans makes it slightly harder to prepare for the draft. Texans could potentially trade. We might convince a divisional rival to trade up to 3 if we convinced them we wanted Richardson / Levis.
It's literally the opposite of the word OP was looking for
I heard GEQBUS invented String Theory! I don't mean he discovered it, I mean he invented the ACTUAL STRINGS!!
Where would you like to see him go then?
Semi biased as a Bama alum, but I agree. I think Young has been by far the best QB of the new era Alabama QBs.   I think a lot of the debate is just completely manufactured for offseason drama. Bryce was the consensus QB1 of this draft for a little under two years until it changed in *February*? I don’t know how so many people fell into that trap.
I mean, I genuinely just think they want Young. The whole size thing has really only been a knock since CFB ended and people needed drama. Young is pretty clearly the best QB in the draft
Cope.  Young has always been the favorite. Combine season has been marked by attempts to justify how anyone but young should be #1.  The news cycle has run the gamut on all of them. Now we’re back to the inevitable: Bryce Young is the best QB in the draft and he will go first overall.
That'd be pretty interesting tbh. Has a team ever traded to one only to flip it later?
Even at -110 now, my money is on Bryce, imo
That’s true, but the “insiders” were still saying that it was 100% Jabari Smith even after the odds shift lol I dont trust them with anything.
Im just a big fan of Brett Favre
Matt was a rookie playing in a completely new offense...and lets be real, he had very little offensive line support.    But those of us who saw him up close and personal while he was at Ole Miss know he has the arm talent for the league.  And I have no doubt he would have gotten starts this past season if he hadn't been injured.  He just never had the time to absorb the offense before he was injured and had to focus on getting better and rehabbing
Vegas has them dead even now, for what it's worth.
Yep lol unless you read the comment as straight-faced which it absolutely was not
That why he spends so much time as a second stringer?
Unrealistic he drops to 5 but Seahawks with Metcalf and Lockett
He just needs to beef up a bit more and if he stays healthy he will have a great shot of winning at least 1 SB. He just has that ability to lead a team, especially when his team is down he can get them back in it.   His heroics in that UT-Bama game were legendary.
it just depends on who gets to make the final judgement for QB; their GM drafted Russell Wilson and Reich has had big QBs historically
cope?  Even the Panther beat writers and people in the Athletic said the Panthers traded up for Stroud. Now could they have switched to Bryce like that? Sure but if you remember right after the trade, there were reports that the Panthers wanted to trade down
You mean Hillbilly reverse Robin hood?
Oh I’m with you in support of the guy. In fact, he was the only QB I wanted in last years draft and thought he was more deserving to be a mid-late 2nd rounder. I just have trouble with the thought of a different team buying into his potential enough to give us anything worth trading him for. The injury is really a crucial turning point here. Lis franc injuries can effectively be career-ending  Like if someone does offer a 6th or 7th, should we even trade him? Probably not. He’s at least more familiar with our receiving core than any other rostered-QB will be this season. Then, no matter which QB we draft, but especially if we take Young, it’s probably better to not put all of our eggs in one basket for a 6th/7th. Even having a “bad” QB on a rookie contract as a contingency plan holds inherent value.
He is an INFINITE stringer!
Young was able to work with Alabama’s WRs which aside from Williams and Mechie were nothing special especially compared to  Strouds Arsenal of weapons.
It’s possible. I just don’t understand that we know that this Panthers rumor about Young is a smokescreen, but we all are confident the Texans are deadset on Houston. So confident that the Panthers are willing to trade down to gamble on it, instead of just getting their guy?  To me, it just sounds like both teams like Young more. Which tracks everything from the last 2 years before the media drummed up a tighter race than existed
You sure throw the word “report” around a lot when talking about random pundits on twitter speculating with zero evidence
So basically Robbin’ hoods
Love that guy
… and now he is going to go to Terrace Marshall DJ Chark and Adam Thielen against NFL defenses as a rookie QB.  That doesn’t extremely concern you?
I’m beginning to think we like Young more, but am a noted CJ Stroud truther.   That being said, the idea that we’re trying to get Houston to trade up makes sense. If we really like both QBs, and have them as 1a and 1b, then moving down to do puts us in a place where we grab a very good QB no matter what.   It isn’t a gamble at all, but instead being given a pick to make our minds for us.
I guess people dialed in to the Panther organizations are random and so is Joe Person too
I mean, it's as favorable an environment for a #1 rookie QB is expected to go to. Normally these guys go to a team who has completely bottomed out, talent wise. We won 7 games last year with 3 starting QBs and 2 head coaches.  We lost DJ Moore but gained two other recievers who have been productive... why is it such a bad destination?
I think people are misunderstanding my point to be that the Panthers are a disaster and wasteland of talent when in reality I was talking about destinations for what’s best for Bryce Young. It’s pretty undeniable that if he starts this year, his stats are going to be pretty putrid.  I feel like generally NFL fans and NFL organizations are pretty shite at looking past situation and seeing what good QB play is.  Being the starting QB for the Panthers pretty much guaranteed a year from now, his overall reputation is going to be much lower than it is now.  If you expect otherwise, you’re sorta proving my point.  There’s no QB in the NFL that is currently succeeding with weapons that shitty, so if you expect a rookie QB to come in and do it, you’re going to be talking about him as a potential bust a year from now.
What if it's Stroud, I would like to hear your opinion on him if we choose him.  I don't exactly agree with what you're saying but I would like to hear your thoughts
Same for him, or any QB.
Jameis Winston would be top right if it didn't matter which team caught it.
The Lamar deep ball overthrows are one of the most painful parts of being a Lamar fan.
Folks we just found a graph that doesn't have Mahomes at the extreme top right
We didn’t even make the list our offense was so bad.
Sure would be nice to give Tannehill some actual protection and weapons, wouldn’t it?
Half of deep ball stat credit should go to wide receivers which makes me really surprised Tannehill is so high up.
Listen guys, we're trying to get a deal done. Could we wait to post these graphs until after? Thanks.   -- Howie
did….did the colts not attempt a pass above 25 yards? i don’t see any of their qbs
top right tua?
Going from Russ deep bombs to Genos last year made me feel spoiled
jaredgoffperfectlybalanced.jpg
Rodgers throwing a bomb into double coverage on 3rd and short became the default play last year. This doesn’t surprise me at all.
Damn Kyler Murray's short on this chart too
GENO!
Falcons legend Taylor Heinicke with that deep ball efficiency 🥵
Weird choice of axis here, like is it not abundantly obvious that EPA is very very very very strongly correlated with CPOE on this play type?  It might be more interesting to replace one of the Axis with something like fraction of the player's passes which were >25 Air yards or something.  Right now this is mostly a line graph.
Does the size of the logo represent the amount of deep balls attempted? I just wonder why some are bigger than others
I'd love to see this plotted vs qb height. just to see if there's any correlation.
Ryan Tannehill and Geno Smith at the top right just feels under appreciated.
That's my perfectly average QB!
Weird to think this is the last off season when we are going over data from the previous season that will contain data on Tom Brady.
Always knew Tannehill was better than Josh Allen at throwing the deep ball too
Hurts’s deep ball was nuts last year, he really worked on his timing and footwork for those plays in the offseason. At some points it felt like as soon as it went deep I just knew it was going to be completed.
Zach Wilson isn’t last at something!!!
Idk I've been told Allen has serious accuracy issues on his deep ball sounds fake
I’m shocked to see Daniel Jones matching Burrow with McDonalds cashiers as receivers.
Andy Dalton in the top right as expected
Oh yea, it’s all coming together
But TUA can't throw it deep... 😂
Hurts is a mean man. It also makes sense schematically why the Eagles would get good deep looks with their constant run threat.
Having watched all of the Marcus Mariota experience I am absolutely shocked there is anyone worse at the deep.
Yeah, lets get Tannehill some WRs. This is ridiculous. Imma need some speed for that play action
But wait, Colin Cowherd keeps telling me that Trevor Lawrence is the second coming of P. Manning, Joe Montana, and (peak) Tom Brady combined.
The AJ Brown effect
Lamar has just sucked at connecting with guys deep the last few years. Some of it is drops, some of it is just overthrows.
Lmao as TH has better efficiency than Wentz when all Wentz had was his deep ball. He’s so bad
I've been saying the past few years Tannehill's deep ball is elite.  He's nearly always right on the money.
Is there anyone more average than Mac Jones?  He's not awful, not great.. just average in every way.
Kyler murray does not get talked about enough as lowkey being one of the worst qbs
Not surprised to see Hurts, Tua, Geno, Allen up where they are considering their talent and receivers. WTF is Ryan Tannehill doing up there throwing to the corpse of Robert Woods and and an asthmatic Burks all season?
r/toprightHurts
They really cropped this to hide Sam Darnold (who should be in the top right corner past Hurts) when will they stop disrespecting our GEQBUS?
No Panthers or Colts QB qualified?
As a former Lamar fantasy owner, he is incredibly good and throwing bad passes.   It’s a small consolation that his play cost him about $50M and him representing himself may have cost him another $25M.
Someone still ain't writing back.
 Go Hawks
Where Colts 😐
Every day is just another dunk on the Cardinals
sad how so many graphs like these exist and some clowns still want us to ditch tua for lamar
#TopRightTua
And despite this, mfers will still try to say "Tua has a noodle arm"
GENO SMITH LETS GOOOOOOOOO
Hell yeah Geno
So the receivers are the most important part
And somehow Mac is getting shit on left and right two years into his contract… He’s no deep ball thrower, but he also protects the ball well considering he was given a high school offense last season
Can't throw a deep ball they said...  Look at my man Hurts up top.
And people *still* say Tannehill was TEN's problem last year smh lmao
My boy geno actually isn't bad at it
Colts passing game so bad we dont even get a spot on the graph
Fuck your axis graph. Its a stupid format.
One of my buddies was trying to act like Tannehill is trash, he’s far from the best QB in the league but stats like this illustrate why I think he’s a solid QB that just has no good weapons and isn’t being utilized correctly.
As a Bama fan this graph pleases me very much
The “Mac Jones has a weak arm” crowd looks kinda dumb now
Where would Purdy fall on this graph? I don’t see a minimum number of throws.
Kind hard to really put any merit on this list because it’s really just who has the fastest and best deep ball catcher. I’ve seen AJ brown make so crazy deep ball catches same with hill and Diggs and they are all near the top. Now Tannahill is wild idk who he was even throwing to for this deep balls and he literally plays in my team division.
“Jalen can’t throw the deep ball accurately”
b-b-b-but...Murray Magic?!
Rodgers deep ball has been pretty bad for a couple years now
This should be controlled for play action imo. Everyone in the top 5 apart from Allen and maybe geno relied on play action for much of the deep ball throws.
Lol the Jets about to downgrade
Rodgers really missed a lot of deep passes in 2022.  It was very uncharacteristic and frustrating.
But Hurts isn't anything special, right? You could throw any old QB back there and have the same level of success, right?   Best deep ball QB in the league last year and I will not be taking questions
Herbert being avg during a year he played with broken rib cartilage 👍
Surprised to see Tannehill so high
Top right = very obviously good deep threat WRs  Bottom left = very obviously no deep threats.
Looking at this stat does that mean Geno Smith will regress back to his mean and that his stats were inflated this year due to his deep throws working out at a higher rate of efficiency?
Interesting. Purdy should be above Geno and below Tua I believe for Niners fans wondering.
Fuck charts
Tannehill makes this seem less important
Bears fans be like “[Fields has been one of the most efficient deep ball throwers](https://reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/12cww83/daniel_greenberg_dj_moores_agent_drew_rosenhaus/jf40aeo)”
Mac dead center with Matty P running the show? BULLISH!
Deep threats ➡️  No deep threats ⬅️  This is a WR stat
Just picturing Jalen seeing this and sending it to the meme thread I imagine he has with Smitty and AJ
Ehh my eyes disagree with your statistics
Tua a little misrepresented here. He throws short routes that his speed demon receivers bust into long gains.
Interesting stat because SO much goes into this happening!
Heinicke 😳
Our boy JA17 has come a long way since his rookie season! Woo!
This is just a graph of the best receiving groups minus the outliers of Tannehill, Brady, Fields (kinda)
Interesting to see because Allen’s deep passing game was pretty bad for his first two or three seasons, even when he was putting up good numbers otherwise.
Man Kyler Murray makes Lamar look good by comparison.
One of these players wants 230M guaranteed
Can we please end any remaining foolishness regarding Detroit pursuing Lamar or that it would somehow be a good idea now? Goff’s “glaring” weakness at passing the deep ball is being greatly exaggerated
Cousins always getting shit but looks pretty fucking close to Mahomey
Seems like this stat is pretty related to having great receivers
Wow, Aaron Rodgers dropped. He used to be the best!
Mariota was such a bum
I see you Taylor "Fuck It Terry Down There" Heinicke
I don't watch the Cardinals so maybe I'm missing something, but how did Kyler Murray ever get a $230M contract? Everything I see about him on Reddit is very negative haha
Brock purdys stats on this would be interesting for me
Radically different sample sizes.
Man Derek Carr really loved the deep ball but isn’t good at it lol
Where's Brocky Purdy you cowards?
Whyd they put trubisky instead of our starting QB
Zach Wilson more efficient at deep ball passes than Aaron Rodgers. Jets leverage 📈📈📈
How does a Y-axis of EPA per attempt and an X-axis of completion percentage above expected (wtf?) = deep ball passing efficiency?   I’m genuinely asking.
this is porn for bama fans
I remember last season how literally half the eagles sub was CERTAIN hurts would be awful
When DJ gets himself a #1 I have really high hopes for him. He just needs to pull the trigger this year or they (Daboll/Kafka) need to let him
Man down!
At first I didn’t see the Giants logo and assumed it was because Daniel Jones didn’t throw any deep balls last season.
justin fields within the top half of the QBs with 0 wide receivers minus mooney which got injured
Oh look, we didn’t throw deep balls.
Graphics like this decrease my enjoyment of sports almost as much as discussions about betting lines.
Love’s deep shits are better than Rodgers.
No Purdy?
Trubisky was always surprisingly ok on deep passes compared to the rest of his accuracy. 2018 he was bad but always had a dime or two, not always 25yds but usually in that range. Gave me so much hope lol
Patriots are in the middle of almost all of these charts. They really were the most mid team imaginable last year.
Murray what you doin?
Nice, looks like GEQBUS is literally off the chart.
r/toprighthurts ?
Every Steeler fan just got triggered at the thought of Chase Claypool falling down for every deep ball.
Just a reminder, Tua and Jalen were both at Alabama at the same time, along with Mac Jones.
That boy nice
King Heinicke
Danny Dimes being in the good part of the graph makes me very happy
Daniel Jones right on top of Burrow, with 1/100th of the receiving talent is staggering.
And JF1 is only going to get better
Anyone going to talk about Daniel Jones tied with Joe Burrow? Where those haters at
GO ON JALEN
Lol where the panthers qb?
The one thing all of the charts have in common is Goff smack dab in the center.
well it helps when you got terry as a wr
Fucking wild actually cause if you compare Kyler and Heinicke you’d say Kyler has the stronger arm but this says otherwise, right? Or Kyler is just that inaccurate?
Tua and Hurts Are Ballin
Rodgers deep ball was butt last year. Missed Watson so many times (yes Watson had the biggest drop all season on his first target)
Tua!
Heineke up there. Good for you bro
Damn Allen is good, not Geno good, but still.
Where are the Panthers QBs?
Jalen is definitely gonna be awesome to watch next year. He is gonna be hungry, the whole team is. I wouldn't be surprised if he wins MVP.
Arizona, what happened?
Kyler💀
Deshaun Watson not listed in the balls deep- I mean deep ball category?
Lions won the trade
To be fair though, a lot of this is definitely strongly impacted by the kind of deep threats these QBs have, not to discredit anyone at all.   Color me surprised that the QBs who have Tyreek Hill, Waddle, DeVonta Smith, Diggs, and Lockett were among the league leaders in deep pass accuracy. And also color me surprised that the QBs with a relatively empty cupboard at WR last season like Rodgers, Lamar, and Lawrence were near the bottom.   Yikes Kyler Murray though lol, hope he rebounds next season. He's got Marquise Brown at least.
Why is this graphed against EPA/play? It's nearly a 1:1 correlation, why not just graph it on a single-axis
Where would Brock Purdy rank on here?
HUrTs cANt THrOw dEEP
What does “completed percentage over expected” mean?
Surprised Purdy isn't on the chart given how many games he started. And how he's pretty clearly QB1 right now for the 49ers.
Fuck it, someone’s down there
That made me laugh out loud thanks
Please someone add it into the graph
Jamies isn't the best QB out there, but I'll be damned if he isn't the most entertaining out there.
That missed TD to Andrews against the Bills. Absolute blown coverage and he threw it out of the back of the endzone with no one remotely close to Andrews  Even a Bills fan who was happy it happened...it felt painful
Just get some faster receivers
I’m pretty sure most fans will tell you one of Lamar’s biggest weaknesses is that he refuses to look for anything but the deep play. Pocket breaks down and Lamar scrambles outside? He takes a 50 yard shot on 2nd and 10 when Andrews was wide for a first. Que 3rd and long with Roman’s terrible pass concepts and Lamar’s tendency to not take the easy yards combined gave us so many 3 and outs.
When Falcons fans asking for Lamar don't realize, somehow, Mariota is better at the ddep ball
That sounds a lot like Flacco too
For some unknown reason Hurts will still be considered a “running” quarter back with throwing issues. Curiouser and curiouser
Curious if the WR turnover has anything to do with that.
Most of the time, it’s down to the WR not getting enough separation. Not a single receiver last year had combo of “elite speed + above average route running”
Josh was really bad throwing deep ball early in his career. This year was by far his best but he got better every year at all
Seems like last year it was worse than usual.
Reid completely overhauled the offense to be centered around a short passing attack with the lack of consistent deep threats. Mahomes averaged 4 yards in the air and 8 yards after catch per passing TD this year IIRC. Incredible job by a HOF coach  That being said, I for one am here for #TopRightHurts
Clearly this graph is fake news
Mahomes took that personally. Book 1k yards for MVS 🫣
It's also a graph that actually has The Broncos on it lol
We regressed Mahomes to the mean and he still somehow ended up being the sixth best quarterback
r/toprightMahomes in shambles
Regress to the mean guy smirking from heaven
Mahomie has never really had a great deep ball, IMO. For someone with his arm strength, you’d expect better.
He also has no AJB and no Smith. Receivers helps a lot
I'm just shocked Brissette ranked that high
He's obviously not "bad" at it, but if I had to pick the worst part of mahomes' game it's deep throws. He left a lot of yards on the table with MVS this year (prob goes both ways, but some were clearly misses). And in previous years he had Hill, who I personally think is one of the best ball trackers I've ever seen.  Still pretty damn good, don't get me wrong. But it's definitely not god-like.
It's "above expected" and his expected is already above everyone else... and he still exceeded that by a bit!  We just had lower expectations for the top 5, that's all. 😁
Tbh thats any deep ball qbr
I hate these kinds of graphs.
we also found a graph that maybe proves that deep pall passing efficiency doesn't mean jack shit???
No Panthers QBs on here either.
Blind spin zone, we were so good we didnt fit on the graph
Said that the whole time he was with the Dolphins
The sheer disrespect to Racey McMath lol
I remember saying this so many times.
I know that feeling bro.
Late stage Jon Robinson failed Ryan so badly.
Treylon burks will get there!
Tannehill is elite
Healthy Burks + JSN coming
Welcome to the Daniel Jones Universe
Poor guy deserved so much better over his whole career, it’s unironically been no weapons and shit protection for like all but 3 of his seasons as a pro :(
Nope instead y’all will trade 3 1st rounders to draft an even better version of Malik Willis tbh.
Daniel Jones has a higher EPA/play on deep shots than Mahomes and the same as Burrow lmao.
Tannehill is criminally underrated and i will die on this hill.  He has some of the worst receivers in the NFL. He has one of the worst lines in the NFL. All he has is Derrick Henry. And despite that, he manages to put up average/slightly above average passing efficiency statistics. The last time we gave him a mediocre line and AJ Brown (who was injured like 35% of the season) and basically nothing else, he got MVP votes.   The man has been done so dirty.
Tannehill is massively underrated. He was outright elite in 2019 and 2020. His numbers the last two years look worse than how he's actually played, mainly due to the entire offense falling apart outside of him and Henry.
Tannehill does really well off play action passes (usually because of Henry). Like halfway through our season before his injury he was 1st in the league in PA yards per attempt. Pretty much every team we play completely sells out to stop Henry which leaves favorable matchups elsewhere.
Tannehill has always had a great deep ball.
The fact that Mac Jones and our WRs are middle of the road on this just makes last years "90% screens and plays where receivers run into each other" offense under Matt Patricia even more frustrating.
He plays it safe going deep and only goes for wide open guys deep
Tua
Yes a credit or discredit.  I’d like to see this stat post claypooper trade.
Half of Jalen's should go to AJB vs the Steelers specifically. It felt like he just made the same exact throw four times and had three touchdowns
Maybe a third to wide receivers. Play action is also super important to good long throws and is the main reason for Tannehill being so high.
Don’t worry according to that one recent article on NFL.com Hurts salary will only be $40mm per year!
Listen guys, we're trying to get a deal done. Could we please keep posting these graphs? Thanks.  -EDC
Listen guys, the eagles are trying to get a deal done. Could you keep posting these graphs until they get a deal done? Thanks  - Schoen, Jones, and Mayhew
It's a miss on my part. The minimum attempts is 15 but I didn't mention that in the graph or the title. Ryan just barely missed, by one attempt. He would be next to Josh Allen.
2nd in air yards. Waddle 10th in YAC and Hill at 14th.   Like most Dolphins fans, hope towards Tua improving even more in the second year of McDaniel’s system and of course for good health.
He’s been top right on almost all 2022 passing statistics
I’ve started printing these charts and putting them up as pictures in my man cave.
Too bad he doesn’t remember any of it.
Literally the OG
r/middlemiddlegoff
Last year? Homie that’s been going on for like 5 years now.
And we love him for it
Garrett Wilson may be able to help
(I'll just stay here in the left lower corner and hope nobody sees how bad I am)
He’s gonna be starting by week 2. Enjoy the GOAT
Very happy for Atlanta to have Taylor.   Washington legend no matter how you see it. He will be remembered as one faint gleem of hope during an otherwise hopeless era.
I agree with this take 100%, but brother I also wish you to learn the word axes.
Yep, indicative of volume.
That’s what she said
It's not the size that matters, it's how you use it bud
I really feel like the Bengals disaster class tainted the public's opinion on  Tannehill so much that now he is underrated. People call him ass even though he has nothing to work with. Idk if it's unpopular opinion but I like the young pass catching group that Titans have but that O line is just awful.
didn’t expect this typa gut punch today 😭😭
Well, unless Quez was the target
He's a baller. A little more touch and he's going to dominate the NFC.
Tyreek or Waddle are down there somewhere
Also the two wide receivers that have. Hurts completed a lot of "just give your guy a chance" bombs this year. That is not to say they were not well thrown balls. But AJ and Devonta deserve a ton of credit for the success of these plays.  Eagles have not had one receiver like these guys since TO. Alshon made some big plays. But watching these two this year, it really felt like cheating. "Wait. This is a thing? Whenever we need a big play, Hurts can just toss it up and they'll make it work? Great! Lol"  And to your point, having an oline that could steamroll in the run and also keep a clean pocket for 5 seconds made things very challenging for opposing defenses. Team was so fun last year and it really felt special. Hope they stay hungry this year and can repeat it.
Hurts is coming for Mahomes top right status and it starts with this one
Colin Cowherd just ranks qbs off of who is the biggest and strongest. The quicker a qb gives him a boner the more elite they are.
I used to enjoy watching his stuff. Now he drives me crazy. I’m not sure if I changed or he’s just gotten bad.
Cowherd is Jim Rome with less personality
Imagine if Tannehill had a receiver like AJB.   It would be Titans dynasty
A lot of it is drops*  &nbsp;  ^and ^a ^lot ^of ^it ^is ^overthrows ^:(
The new Kirk cousins
It’s cuz short guy run fast and that makes everything else fade away
Haha, I came here to see Matt Ryan in last place. Dude didn’t even throw deep enough to be in this group.
You mean Oklahoma?
Obviously reality is fake and he has a noodle arm.   It's crazy how much people shit on Mac for made up reasons.
Thanks for bringing that up, I hadn't realized I didn't mention the minimum. It is 15 attempts. Purdy would be far over in the top right quadrant. However, he only had five attempts. He is paired with Zappe as league leaders if I lower the requirements enough to bring him in.
I watched every game and I can assure you that I don’t even remember who he threw deep balls to.
Most qbs in the league would be up where Hurts is behind that O-line.
It's a good idea, but I don't know where I could gather that data. NFLfastR doesn't have it, which is what I used to aggregate everything. PFF has play-action passing data, but not data on play-action *deep* passing.
They don't actually realize he's washed
I'm mean that's not true. Tua's IAY/PA was almost same as Herbert's prior to this season. 2022 Herbert's dropped and Tua's exploded up
Tannehill always had a great deep ball. He was just highly criticized early in his career because he couldn't connect with Mike Wallace. They just had no chemistry.
13th ain’t bad with Equanimeous St Brown as his primary deep ball guy most of the year
Making 13th without a single reciever ranked in the top 55 by Pff is kinda ridiculous my guy lol but nice try
Is that you Boston Conner?
Tannehill being top right disagrees
That’s just not true at all lol  I know it’s fun to parrot what you see on Reddit or Twitter, but try actually watching the games. I know it’s difficult to understand the rules since most bills fans started watching 3 years ago, but I can recommend some resources for you if you’re interested in learning the sport!
That’s not how this graph works. I don’t know who’s more sensitive about tua, bills fans or dolphins fans lol.
It's okay, I too sometimes forget to read the post title before commenting.
Because it's only using those metrics for passes of 25 air yards or more.
That’s Rex Grossman’s motto.  Gotta unleash the dragon.  Teams couldn’t handle all that twisted steel and sex appeal.
Underrated comment right ☝️
The Ravens would’ve beaten us easily in the first game if Lamar could’ve hit a wide open guy 30 yards down the field. As Tee would put it he was “booty butt naked open”
It is a terrible feeling watching an wide-fucking-open dude get overthrown.  'Cool... I guess. How bout we not rely on them sucking, though? Maybe we could... play well, right?'
I love that you guys are helping me defend my argument against my friend, that Kyler Murray does somethings better than Lamar. But then I look at the chart and think, well maybe it’s better to not bring this up in our argument. Lol.
It’s definitely easy. Just draft one and then trade for one. Done.
Can confirm this works. It used to look like QB's were trying their hardest to overthrow prime Randy Moss but he'd always catch up to it. So if they can find him a prime Randy Moss type receiver he should be good to go
This is funny because they have (and had) nothing but fast receivers and Lamar still overthrows them.
cade mcnown has entered the chat
you'd think that, but that didn't stop Stidham from overthrowing the fastest WR in college every game at Auburn.
This sounds like the last five seasons we had with Russ.
I wonder why... 🤔
It doesn't matter who the receiver is if he can't hit him 30+ yards downfield when they're wide open. It sucks bc he has a cannon of an arm but his placement is average at best.
Most of the time but I know at least 3 big play TDs were missed with no defender within 10 yards of the WR
Yeah, KC saw a lot of two deep this year in an effort to minimize the big plays downfield. It forced them to be more patient and methodical, which they of course were still able to do. Same thing with Cincinnati.
Especially with him being injured towards the end of the season added with downgrades to WR, they did a bunch of dump off plays but it seemed to work for them well enough
/r/the_darnold is leaking
The more things change, the more they stay the same.
We actually got to see it a couple years in Tennessee and he looked like a top 5 QB.
Even more to NWI and Cody Hollister
What an incredible name. It's like what you'd name a character in a movie about a mathlete who tries out for the HS football team and eventually scores the game-winning TD.
Every team says it about their semi-decent quarterback lmao
Worst thing about the AJ Brown trade is that no issue going in was addressed. We still have one pass catcher worth a damn with unfortunate injury luck, only difference is that we have a Razorback instead of an Ole Miss Traitor.
>even better version of Malik Willis  I'm so confused by this selection of words implying that Malik was good in any respect.
This would be an L of epic proportions.   The mock drafts are hella ridiculous, no way would any competent GM would do such a thing.
I’ve always said Daniel Jones is basically Joe Burrow with less sacks /s
Part of this is that Danny didn't try too many difficult deep shots last year. He's a great deep ball thrower but under Daboll he preferred the easy 6-7 yards over the shot at 20+. He was 2nd to last in intended air yards per attempt behind the corpse of Matt Ryan.
DJ has always had a respectable deep ball, I think he’d have another step up in his career with a good (and healthy) deep threat to pair it with.
Unfortunately when tannehill left the dolphins, he just went to the dolphins of the afc south
Agreed love me some Tannehill. I think you’re misremembering the AJ Brown injury though he played in every regular season and playoff game that year.
Underrated as a passer, probably true, but Tannehill's Achilles heel has always been his pocket presence. He takes a huge number of sacks and he doesn't have the awareness or agility to avoid them.  [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbi5JgNP8E) is a great example. Criticize the line play all you want, but Tannehill makes no effort to avoid the sacks and seems to have no idea they're coming. He loses games in critical moments.
I do think he takes a team friendly deal like mahomes.
Did Mayfield not have enough attempts between his snaps with CAR and LAR? Sorry if I missed him on the graph.
~~Curious if Brock Purdy was close to that threshold?~~  Edit: nvm saw your other comment  https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/12elv2a/oc_deep_ball_passing_efficiency_attempts_25_air/jfbs63l/
niceee
Gonna be honest, I hope he improves but I don't need improvement. Just smarter quarterbacking  If he can figure out when to go down and when to check down, while also improving his consistency (I imagine getting injured less would help this), he's a top 5 QB all day
I saw people in a thread a few days ago unironically saying the Dolphins would get a better deep pass game if they picked up Lamar.
I just hope he learns to take a hit. I hate to see a good player retire from injury but he's just gonna have to if something doesn't change very quick.
It’s not his play that is questionable at all. It’s staying on the field.
it was a last offseason meme, r/toprighttua
Tua doesn't suck like Teddy Bridgewater but he reminds me of how Vikings fans would always pull out "advanced analytics" to explain why their 3300 / 14 TD / 9 INT QB was *actually* a top 5 QB because he was 2 standard deviations better than the rest of the league on intermediate passes to the left side of the field on 2nd and short or other bizarre shit like that.  Edit: classic vikings fans to be down voting me for being right 🤣
This is r/midmidKirk erasure
Very true. But this chart was just about last year and previously Tae would catch some of those. You’re right though.
Is Lazard wide open?   Yeah.  Ok, I’ll throw it to the other receiver who’s triple covered instead…
Rumor has it that Rodgers still sees Kerby Joseph in his nightmares from time to time.
Iirc the year before he was one of the better QBs at deep balls
Derek Carr out there chucking it.
Yeah, that game had more issues than Tannehill but he’s the qb and took the brunt of the heat.
Hey, he caught it that one time. And then he dropped it.
He’s just leaned into his biases. If he likes a player or team he hypes them up (Lawrence, Alabama, USC, Michigan, Lincoln Riley, etc) to the point that it’s almost nauseating.
https://i.imgflip.com/247pac.jpg
Remind me how many games Hurts started there vs Bama? Or how many championships won?
Thanks for clarifying! That’s interesting to hear. Anecdotally, I know myself and a lot of other Niners fans thought it felt like our deep-ball game had opened up after he took over, even though it’s never really been a huge part of our offense under Shanahan. I’ll be really curious to see if Purdy maintains that level of performance with a bigger sample size next season.
Yeah it is a very informative graph regardless.   I guess it would be interesting to use just play action generally and see the results but could create more uneccessqry noise
13th is slightly over average and far from one of the most
The kids a Hall of Famer
Exceptions to a rule don’t disprove a rule. Especially with a sample size issue due to missed games and not throwing deep very often anyway.
Best we can do is draft one then trade him away.
DID YOU SAY TRADE YOUR WR?
Ezpz
While you’re at it just find a prime Pat Mahomes to throw to him.
If Moss can’t get to it, can’t nobody get to it
People spent a lot of last year talking about how awful Hurts was on deep throws. He definitely improved in the offseason, but AJ Brown is a huge part of why he’s on top here
There's a reason Randy spent most of his career salty as hell.  Then he went to play with Brady and still didn't win a ring.
But are they cheetah fast or just regular fast?
Put Lamar at receiver. Lamar to Lamar. Problem solved.    Mariota did it I don’t see what the big fucking deal is.
For as frustrating as it was on some of those plays where he didn't take the checkdown, his deep ball dimes put Lamar's attempts to shame.
But man those Russell Wilson deep shots were absolutely beautiful throws
IIRC PFF has him bottom 5 the past 2 years in deep ball accuracy and actually has a higher deep completion % than accurate pass % meaning his receivers are catching some of his inaccurate passes.
It makes me sad that Mariota took a higher spot than LJ.
I definitely agree that he missed some wide open shots last year. Mostly with Wallace.  I’m surprised by the strong negative reaction to basically just asking though, but I suppose all Lamar discourse is heated these days.
It does matter. Being comfortable with a guys speed is a huge part of hitting that throw
Just wondering, do you have a source for that? I couldn’t find anything substantiating that claim but I’d love to take a look if it’s available. Not saying I doubt it, but I’m fairly certain they overhauled the offense in the off-season because of the Hill departure.   I could see it for the Bengals, as their WR room is uber talented, but not so much the Chiefs
Same thing with us. We just didn’t adapt to it at all. Kept calling “go for it all” pass plays on 2nd&3rd and mid-long. That Dolphins playoff game was fucking absurd how many times we tried the deep bomb, to the point that a lot of the people around me in my section were all complaining about the same thing.
Don’t forget about Titans legend Geoff Swaim
We also had a running back named Julius Chestnut. All-time great football name.
Daniel Jones unironically has a very nice deep ball. We just have no WR and no OL so don’t really throw them at all.    This graph is showing why you need to take stats in context though, and can’t just draw conclusions directly from them
And without all the swag
I agree. That’s why I think the Giants should focus on unlocking 2016 Odell and signing him
I mean, kinda fair. We did give him like 1 good year of support when we at least had an average line and AJB for 70% of the time and Corey Davis sometimes. But we absolutely fucked him all around that.   Sorry to let you down.
He only played 650/1220ish snaps in 2021, and 800/1100 snaps in 2020. He had plenty of injuries that kept him out of parts of games. Dude was playing like 60% or the snaps that top WR1s were that year.  We weren't a passing team, but that's not the only reason he wasn't putting up more than 1100 yards in a season. Dude wasn't available like he was for y'all this last season.
Didn't he have an injury designation for a lot of games though? I don't honestly remember, but that could be what they were referring to.
>This video is a great example  How? All 5 sacks came under 2 seconds, and 2 of them were off of play action so he basically had no time to react at all for those two.   >seems to have no idea they're coming  Given that several were from the blind side in under 2 seconds, or immediately after he fakes a handoff for play action, no shit.   The video you posted is an indictment of the line and not of Tannehill. He should be getting nearly a full second longer than any of the sacks in this clip.
I too would accept a very team friendly deal from the Eagles.
Whats weird is while he never knows when to just fall down and take a sack he is elite in pocket awareness.
People straight up just don't see us playing and when they do it's a game like San Diego last season.  Nevermind that QB is tough to judge, mostly because people ball watch.
A lot of people who watch football do not understand football.
It’s crazy because this time last year he was getting shit on.
He had some head scratching moments towards the end of the season but that may just be the concussions
Lmao nah ppl are still questioning his play because they don’t want to admit they were wrong about him
So was r/midmidkirk
On a per-game basis for starters, Tua was 5th in yards, 4th in TDs, and 13th lowest int%.  So for the basic stats you mentioned, he's doing well. His problem is clearly staying on the field.
Like last night how I was saying Fields has no touch on his deep ball and I had a bunch of bears fans coming out of the woodwork telling me fields was “top in almost all deep ball metrics” last season, despite throwing for like, 2200 yards?
I guess when you have Davante you can let loose
Best part of his game tbh
Ha, that’s definitely true. His love for Burrow is pretty wild.  I wouldn’t be surprised if he has a shrine in his closet.
Remind me how many times a backup qb replaced hurts at Oklahoma? Bro it’s a joke not a dick, don’t take it so hard
I’m also surprised he only attempted 5 deep balls, it really felt like there was a few big plays every game he played in this past year
Never said the guy was right but considering our team and how people talk about Fields like he can’t hit the broad side of a barn, 13ths decent
Hollywood was good for one beautiful deep catch per game.  And about 10 maddening catches where he runs five yards back and misses the first down marker by two yards.....
RAVENS AND TITANS BROS 4 LYFE     BIG TRUSS
Lemon squeezy
with the way jackson is trying to negotiate contracts, he apparently thinks he ***is*** prime Mahomes
[Would you classify their speed as "explosive" or "incendiary"?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIWqbESYSWQ)
I think most of us (Ravens fans) understand this but obviously there are still some homers who like to make excuses like he's not used to his WRs speed or something lol
https://mobile.twitter.com/SharpFootball/status/1629192446620930050?t=kC0FMG5mqB3KbA2b4pLsew&s=19  Here's a thread about how we did against every defense
Hopefully having what appears to be a legendary status qb will keep Andy Reid from retiring soon.
Hmm, good call. I'm not finding anything and I may be mixing 2021 & 2022 up. No sites that I use keep track of snaps against particular coverages, which would be handy. The only thing I found was from October 2022 where an article mentioned KC was seeing 17th most cover 2 in the league.   I thought I had read it in analysis somewhere, but it very well could have been referencing 2021.
Yeah, we actually saw more two deep with Hill than this year without him. Defenses challenged us more, but without that number one guy we still had to play disciplined. However, they blitzed Mahomes a lot less this season and would just drop 7 in coverage. That’s because he’s so lethal against the blitz.
Weren’t you talking about 2019? That’d be the year a Tannehill got MVP votes.
He did but he still put up 100 yard games in them.  In 4 games he technically didn’t start: 94 yards, 64 yards, 81 yards, 135 yards lol
I fully disagree. None of the sacks in that video were under two seconds. In three of the five sacks, Tannehill has time to set, and even bounce on his feet a couple of times. He is standing still when he needs to be moving in the pocket and accounting for the pass rush.   Quarterbacks with a "feel for the rush" are valued specifically for situations like these, and unfortunately Tannehill's lack of it has gotten him into trouble time and again.
I’d take a team friendly deal. Friendly to the rest of the division at least
It's like he moves around unconsciously, not thinking about what's actually going on in the pocket
He thinks he can make something out of every play. I like that killer instinct, but I just want to see him stay healthy even if that means a wasted play.
Yah that was definitely part of it. It also doesn’t help when the highlights of his bombs are flooded with comments like “he under-threw that. Mahomes throws that and it’s a TD” except Mahomes would also under throw Tyreek
well to be fair he hadn’t shown the ability to play at a top 5-10 qb level until last season
The Packers game was probably all concussion related . Just didn’t look the same after the hit
Tbh both you and bears fan were being extreme. Saying he has no touch is stupid and saying he was top 5 is stupid.
And Rodgers was still out there just chucking it like he still had Adams at WR.
I know I do
Yeah lol fair, but I don’t think any of the backups at Oklahoma were anywhere near Tua.
Ahh, yes, the Diontae Johnson Special
Don’t worry. It’s not just Ravens fans. He has a lot of neutral fans as well because he’s just fun to watch. By no means is he actually a bad passer… just kinda inconsistent at times. People who really watch the games notice this. I think he definitely WOULD be better with better receivers… but people that act like it’s all his receivers fault are ignoring reality.
That’s an interesting resource with some really good information, thanks for sharing!  It doesn’t address the frequency at which he faced different defenses, but it’s interesting to see the success regardless
Your game against us was the only thing I needed to know that the 2022 Chiefs offense was absolutely dominant. 9ers had a top 2 D all season and your offense just absolutely put the defense in a blender. Reid and Demeco's gap was painfully obvious.
For sure, I really hope he stays for the entire tenure of Mahomes. Such an electric combo, two home runs that become a grand slam when combined
Ha, no worries! It’s extremely difficult to untangle the specifics from the sheer information overload that is sports analytics today, I’m constantly misstating stats, years, and rosters in sports debates with friends and colleagues nowadays. Can’t wait until I’m old enough to simply chalk it up to old age lol  I saw similar things for beating 2-high shells throughout 2021, makes a ton of sense with Hill on the flank. It’d be really interesting to see some of the proprietary data that these analytics outlets have at their disposal - rather than hear the outcomes/narratives that the analysts come up with to explain it
Yeah, the Chiefs were dealing with the 2 high all of the time about a year or so before the rest of the league. By 2022 they were already shredding it and usage of it against them dropped drastically.
Oh, that's fair sorry.  That year it looks like 860/1200 snaps. So about 72% of offensive snaps.  He was honestly hurt a lot while he was here with little nagging injuries.
So he may have been injured but he still played like the elite WR he is basically lol
Sack #1: Film starts after snap has already happened, he's approximately 2 steps behind the line in play action. Finishes faking the handoff at 0.63 seconds and is hit at 1.4 seconds in. He has under 0.8 seconds to perform any read.  Sack #2: Snap occurs at 6.4 seconds into the video, another play action, finished faking the handoff at 7.47 seconds in, and is hit at 9.13 seconds in. He had 1.66 seconds to throw the ball.  Sack #3: Snap at 11.73 seconds, hit at 14.27 seconds. 2.54 seconds - you're right here that he had longer than 2 seconds. Also note that he was hit from his blind side.  Sack #4: Snap at 16.37 seconds, hit at 19.17 seconds. 2.8 seconds, again hit from his blind side.  Sack #5: Snap at 21.33 seconds, hit at 24.6 seconds. Hit at 3.27 seconds, again from his blindside as he steps up in the pocket because his LT got beat again.   I'd argue that the first two were his line's fault, as he's getting hit well under 2 seconds after completing the fake, and the defensive line has a hesitation factor built in from having to play the run.  I'll admit that he certainly had longer than I initially thought, but I'll say that all of these sacks came from the blind side, and I'll also note that median sack time in the NFL last year was 4.29 seconds, so Tannehill's sacks here were definitely all on the low end from a timing perspective.   [Here's an old scatterplot from 2020, when the Titans had a better line](https://imgur.com/a/vNefuE2) - notice that Tannehill's time to throw is around the median.   In [2021](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2021/passing_advanced.htm), Tannehill had the 4th lowest amount of time before the pocket collapsed or he threw the ball. In 2019 and 2022, he was a little better than average on the same stat - so it doesn't really hold up that he holds the ball longer than other QBs.  Titans ranked 7th worst in the league in pass block win rate last year. They were 9th worst in 2021, and 9th worst in 2020. The only time Tannehill had a decent pass blocking line was 2019, when the Titans ranked 4th. Otherwise they've consistently been in the bottom third.
Tf is your username lmfao   But yeah I agree. He’s gotta get it into his head that losing a down is a lot better than being out for multiple games (let alone his health as an individual)
Almost as crazy as Tua losing to every good defense he played against
Not every rookie comes out of the gate looking amazing
Yeah I feel you. He had flashes but I think everyone would agree the situation that he dealt with (roster performance and coaching) was far less than ideal his first two seasons.
Arguably didn't look the same after the Texans game
I mean, no touch is a bit overstating it but I watched him overthrow wide open guys pretty regularly last season, on top of throwing for 2000 yards, I don’t know why we’re all bending over backwards here like he’s this elite passer.
I thought that was catching everything until it really matters?
Well, with him I cheered it on 😉
Thank you for that honest assessment, Bengal Bro
Mahomes has been dealing with the 2High safety for longer and it’s not really accurate to accredit that to this season. But that’s certainly the direction that the team has been moving before Hill left. For example, Hills deep number were way down his final year for the Chiefs because of this issue. It had pretty much been figured out by the time Hill left but it also made for a perfect time to grab a few different receivers for the new look.
Yeah. I know if 2021, he faced a 2-high defense more than 75% of the time, and in the playoffs the Bills and Bengals were pushing 90%+.   I think that dropped in 2022 because Mahomes and Reid showed that they had solved it for the most part in the first half of the season. He still faced a higher share of 2-high looks than any other QB, but it was pretty close to the others at the top. I can't find the articles that I had read about that though.
The stat sheet weirdly doesn’t show it, but as fan living through that Titans era, AJ was *always* hurt. Knee and ankles were never right. He was limping after catches so frequently it turned into running jokes about his health in my friend group.
It’s a goddamn masterpiece is what it is. I’m just ashamed I didn’t start using it until my mid 20s
Could ask the same about your username, my guy.
What was that? Couldn’t hear you from outside the playoffs
Yeah but he also had like the lowest ADoT in the league. It’s quite the drastic change
for sure, my thought was that last season was a “put up or shut up” season for him since he got an offensive minded head coach and elite receiver that offseason. luckily it seems like he showed enough to be the guy going forward, as long as these judo classes help his falling lol
You just he has no touch and now are backtracking on it? Do you talk to the nfl fans outside of Reddit? Not many ppl have a good opinion of Fields throwing ability and the national even local media isn’t super fond of him either. Your only hearing the perspective from super die hard bear fans on Reddit lol like what did you expect.
That too. Dude makes some amazing catches but it'll be 3rd down and the game on the line and he drops an easy slant.
No problem! I try to remain as bias-free as possible lol and I know that Lamar is a very good player. Every QB has their flaws
Started seeing a lot more 2 high safety after the first Super Bowl Win IIRC
Fair enough, my original point of contention was the Chiefs being forced this year to change their offense when they saw mostly 2 high safety - but I can definitely jive with it being a planned occurrence over multiple years. Thanks for the perspective!
Ya ever heard of Fromunda cheese
Sorry you have to repeat that I couldn't hear from you from your last playoff win 23 years ago
he had no offense coaches or wr outside waddle. sherfield and carcraft were miles better than parker and gesiki
That tends to happen when you have a historically bad OL. For comparison, this is what he can do with just a regular bad OL.
I remember our primetime game he was on a go route vs Newsome I think. Newsome had good coverage but Trubs threw it just well to be catchable. Diggs, Adams, Evans, etc all come down with it but Johnson let the ball go through both his hands.
I’m sorry, I couldn’t hear you over only having ever won one Super Bowl, could you repeat that? You can go ahead while I ponder over the feeling of being a fan of a franchise with the only perfect season in NFL history.
Didn't stop people from shitting on Allen when Charles Clay was his #1 target. It's how it goes. Just be thankful you have a legit QB now.
I mean Fields has a terrible OL both years and was still top or near the top in ADoT
And he is living the dream.  Doesn't even want to take another job.  Why would he?   He gets free checks to stay unemployed.  Man.  I would love that deal.
It’s my dream to be a fired head coach with a big buyout/contract guaranteed money
They should probably get direct deposit set up and at least save themselves some money on postage.
Kliff Kingsbury can now live out his true purpose in life of being a villain in a Michael Bay film.
They are absolutely in the worst position in the NFC, maybe the nfl. It’s a mess there right now.
Cardinals Players Cafeteria Menu prices (revised):  Bottle of Water   ~~$1.75~~.  $24.00  Cheese Hamburger.  ~~$6.50~~.   $138.88  Grilled Mahi Mahi w fresh greens. ~~$16.95~~ $545.25   Mr. Bidwell thanks you for your continued support of the Cardinals organization.  (Ps Kliff says hello from Phuket)
That’s nothing. Every July 1st on Bobby Bonilla Day, the Mets send Bobby Bonilla a check for $1.2 million. This started in 2000 and will continue until 2035. He is 60 years now and his last at bat for the Mets was in 1999.
AB might have been onto something about the Cardinals
It's Bobby Bonilla day every other day for Kingsburry.
Kliff will get another job for sure probably after this season. Either an OC somewhere or HC in college. Once you reach that level you basically can get a job indefinitely and football is his life. No wife, no kids etc   Kyler 1000% is not missing this whole year. He’s already running, lifting and throwing with 5 months left until next season.   Look at it this way, Joe Burrow blew out his whole ass knee, ACL/MCL and damaged his PCL about the same time as Kyler and was back W1 the following year and made the SB.   Steve Keim is the only one I see maybe not landing another job but wouldn’t be surprised if he did. Once you’re in the “circle” for as long as he’s been a GM it’s not hard to find work 🤷🏻‍♂️
[removed]
I hate when ppl say knee injuries will destroy mobility/athleticism. This isn't 1987 dude are tearing Achilles and coming back strong 8 months later. ACL isn't even a full year off injury anymore
Doesn't count against the cap, forces Bidwill to shell out his own money for a stupid mistake *he* made, I don't see how this isn't based.
OP just learned what happens when a sports coach gets fired
Good   He is traumatized for firing his offensive line coach before an international game for groping a security guard
"the one trait that makes him an exceptional quarterback." Kyler was drafted first overall because he's as physically gifted throwing a football as he is running it.
Not exactly. These contracts almost always have offset language. Kliff can’t just sit around the next 4 years and collect a paycheck. He has a duty to mitigate by looking for comparable work.  https://www.si.com/.amp/nfl/2022/01/19/business-of-football-end-of-season-coaches-fired
Nobody has failed upwards quite Kliff Kingsbury
Damn, sick of being reminded of pain every day. Hard being a fan of a team you love but they never can get it right :(
Michael Bidwill is a football terrorist
I want the Arizona Cardinals to send me a check every other week too!
It’s posts like these that remind me the Cardinals exist.
The amount of money in sports is baffling. Organizations make terrible million dollar deals all the time and the ad revenue is so great it doesn't even bother the bottom line. College football coaches and now players are making more than brain surgeons and researchers working on curing cancer. I get that they bring in more money for the college, but the system is so jacked up.
Murray is not an exceptional QB.
The fact that he isn't on the Patriots coaching staff for free right now is really mind blowing.
Damn it feels good to be gangsta
Living the dream.
Wait I somehow missed that Kyler was injured. He's not playing this upcoming year?
Mr bagging checks
IT's the "showing commitment" line of thinking vs the "prove it" line of thinking. Do you hold back on commitment and get criticized for not going "all in to win"? Or do you go all in and get criticized for the wrong choice for who to commit to?  It's still fucking insane we gave everyone extensions. At least Keim resigned which means we're off the hook (probably). But to give everyone so much money to basically try and save the season? No wonder Michael Bidwill had to cheat.
A big ass check, too. 200k every two weeks for 4 years.
Kliff was never a good coach. He should have never got a chance in the NFL.
It must be nice to be an overpaid failed NFL coach
I remember watching Kliff absolutely murder my college team when he was at Tech. I respect how much money he was able to fleece from an NFL franchise.
If you white in the nfl you just fail upwards
Kyler is on the bench for this year? I missed that announcement. I thought there was a chance he’d be back at some point.
It's so upsetting coaches get fully guaranteed contracts and players dont
Fired NFL Head Coach is the best job anyone can have
That’s a lot of Thailand money.  For…food and sightseeing.  Definitely nothing else.
Paying Kyler will ultimately go down as the biggest mistake in Cardinals Franchise history.
It's what happens when you hire a thoroughly unqualified guy as your coach.  Kliff Kingsbury was just fired by Texas Tech for having a losing record with Patrick Mahomes as his QB.  He continued to underachieve with a Cardinals team that was stacked with talent.  Possibly the worst hire in NFL history.
Cardinals are one of the most dysfunctional franchises ever…I even told Steve keim it was a bad signing when I saw him in a bar in Scottsdale…he obviously paid no attention to me lol.
There is no better gig than being a fired coach in the NFL or NBA.
I don't blame these guys for going for as much money as they can grab because the owners are all billionaires and the league itself makes 20 billion a year off them. That said, I think if you find yourself in a good position on a good team with a good coaching staff and management then you need to think really hard about giving that up. Do you wanna be Dan Marino or do you wanna win a couple rings? I think Lamar is in a really good place with the Ravens. That team is built around him and his play style, if he goes elsewhere he has a good chance of struggling and/or getting injured.
Well that Patrick Mahomes guy that got paid seemed pretty okay playing through a rough ankle injury. Maybe having that enormous contract helped him not worry about it.
Poverty franchise remains impoverished
Kyler Murray, Russell Wilson, Deshaun Watson  One of these is not like the others.
This dude has been robbing employers for a decade. He got an extension and raise after his first year ever being a head coach in which he finished the season 1-5.
Fired NFL Head Coach is my dream job.
The Bobby Bonilla Special
Imagine getting payed to leave. Dream job is a fired coach
I'm sure you can add the Packers to that list of teams who regret giving out a mega extension to a QB
Well, 1/3 has worked out, and 1/3 is completely unrelated and only connected to this conversation because he's black, and 1/3 is Kyler. So idk what your point is with those three examples
..and sending one to Kyler every week.  Neither of which gives a fuck about the Cards anymore
Bobby Bonilla enters the chat…
Raiders have entered the chat
The Cardinals are paying Kliff, who is paying Diddy, who is paying Sting
Did you just call Kyler Murray an exceptional quarterback?
Can't wait until 3 years from now when Kyler's contract looks like pennies.
But owners would NEVER give out guaranteed contracts to just anyone🙄
>Come to think about it, what incentive does any team have to pay Lamar giant guarantees?  He's a really good quarterback.
Must be a nice life to be paid while on a long "PTO" in Thailand
And they gotta send the checks to Thailand.
I, too, would like to get in on this scheme
He’s going to retire well
Wish i could get paid after getting fired from a past job.
Balling!!!!
I have no idea how contracts and stuff work so can someone give an educated guess on what he’s probably actually making each week?
Aka, mailbox money.
Cardinals fell for the Kingsbury prince scam. The email promises you a share of a multimillion-dollar fortune in exchange for helping get the money out of the sender's home country.
This is why I'm glad the Falcons haven't fallen for this trap......yet.  (Please just keep Ridder, please just keep Ridder)
Future Battlehawks Coach?😂
Can I get a check too? 😥
Kliff Kingsbury will be sending the Arizona Cardinals a selfie from Thailand every other week for the next four years
>	an injury that will bench him for this year, and could destroy the one trait that makes him an exceptional quarterback.  Kyler also has unreal arm talent
How much are they paying Steve Wilks? He only got one year.
Meh. The 49ers we’re paying 3 or 4 head coaches at one point.  Two ain’t so bad.
Little ridiculous
In the words of [Les Grossman](https://imgur.com/a/2QOXGIE)
They were literally on a 7 game winning streak at one point lol
Ain't no way I'd commit to that. Just give him the chunk and be done. Extending Kyler and Cliff last year looked just as stupid when they did it as it does now
Sounds like it’s time for a Josh Rosen redemption arc.  Have the writers get on that!
DAAAMN how much is the cheque for??
I wonder who else currently is still getting paid in the NFL long after they've been removed, and for how long
he'll be coaching soon enough. I know a lot of people hate working but these guys are obsessed with this.
On top of giving Kyler $54M next season… and he gets more expensive for them…
They Also won't be any better for that time period.
Booo where’s the fun in that? Just make it one check every year on the same day. We only have so many Bobby Bonilla days left. We need a replacement
How did this big of a dumpster fire yield us the most boring season of Hard Knocks?
And this is why guaranteed money is fucking stupid
One of the few people I’ll ever be jealous of in real life. The list: Tom Brady, Harry Steinbrenner, Kliff Kingsbury.
he has it made. How much is he getting sent?
Why every other week?
Deshaun Watson was a good player. He made the Texans contenders. That just needed a little more help. But who knows about him now that he’s a rapist. I don’t see a person with that shit on his plate to succeed.
That doesn’t come from the Salary Cap, so why do you even care?
[This post. ](https://media.tenor.com/qxt4azx5qNkAAAAC/rick-james-chappelle.gif)
Yes but Murray’s contract is insured so while they take a cap hit, they don’t actually spend money to pay him. The insurance pays most of it.
[Living the American Dream](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/private/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop_2x/f_auto/cardinals/t95cuo5zwbe7scnojdxf.jpg)
That's nice of them
Must be nice
I don’t mean to be insulting but it kind of is just that .  Who owns the Arizona franchise and for how long ?  That team has been one of the biggest shit shows in nfl history .  Like two or three great years when they had Kurt and those wrs but other than that oh my
I would also like to have the same check. I won just as many super bowls as he did
Read an article where NFL teams are going to pay over $500 million to coaches, GMs, etc that are no longer with the team. Mad money in the NFL.
This is how Arizona plays. Extreme highs and extreme lows with little in between.
The red sox paid  amnny ramirez for so many years after he was out of the league, same for dustin pedroia, pedroia was making 17 mil a year  to sit at home for 4 years.
Doesn’t he have to pretend to look for another job?
There is no better job on this earth than fired head coach. Absolutely obscene amounts of money from an organization that has more financial stability than the USD contractually guaranteed for years of doing nothing.
He's currently living on a turquoise water beach in Thailand eating mescaline and having orgies with beautiful women, on the Cardinals dime lol
Yeah but what if he wants to coach at Nebraska?
Kingsbury Basic Income
He's been a coach for over a decade.  He's used to grinding, working hard.  Sure, he probably likes not working 100 hour weeks, but I give it a year before he's back on the sideline somewhere.  People who are wired to be that dedicated and work that hard at a job don't spend too much time relaxing on a beach.
I think the contracts say he is at least suppose to look for work.
Kingsbury Doughboy.
Not really related but this reminds me of that comment asking what happened to director John Carpenter and the top response being "he retired to smoke weed and play videogames because he's the king" and I just like to imagine that's the case with tons of retired prolific people who just sort of disappeared from the public eye.
Would he not be able to take another job and also still get the checks? Easily double his salary (unless he can't).
I recall reading somewhere that standard language in a lot of these big money coaches’ contracts is a requirement they continue to seek employment in the coaching field.
Not true.  Cardinals payout becomes void if Kliff doesn't take another job/look for another job.  This is common practice in the NFL for coaching payouts called mitigation:     Guarantees in coaching contracts are offset guarantees, meaning the firing team’s financial liability is reduced if and when the coach secures work and is paid by another team during the term of the contract. While the firing team has an obligation to pay off the contract, the fired coach has a duty to mitigate, meaning he has an obligation to seek and find a similar coaching position with another team (that can be a college team as well). In other words, the fired coach cannot simply sit and collect his paycheck; he has to mitigate and try to find another job, with the payments from the new job offsetting the amount owed from the firing team.
He could go to the Pats and work for free.
Yeah hard to believe but some people like working
I don’t blame ya, damn good deal
Honestly with kingsbury luck he’ll probably return to coaching in 4 years  Get a high profile OC job  Do it for a year   Then get another HC job   Or he’ll just become the a knock off Romo type color guy    Kliff always comes out on top
Get some food stamps find a section 8 single mother. Good to go
Remember how boring 2020 was bro? The dude is gonna be itching to do something
Best response ever from Coach O upon finding out he would be paid the remainder of his deal at LSU.   “Which door y’all want me to leave from?”
The only better position is journeyman back up QB. Zero expectations, any good performance is lauded. Getting paid to crack beers in the tape room basically.
The highest paid state employees (pretty liberal use of the term but still) are university athletics coaches.   It's my dream too man. Mine too.
I would just spend all my time woodworking
Agents gotta agent.
I would happily fall on that sword
This kind of shit happens in normal industries too (though with less money obviously).   Common for V-level and above management to be kept on the payroll for a year after they get canned, plus a fat severance.
I think what people don't realize is the only way you get a job like a head coach in the first place is if you're ultra competitive and want to build a legacy. The vast majority of fired head coaches don't want to just ride off into the sunset rolling in their mountains of money. They want to work, it's part of who they are
The fact that Coaching contracts are fully guaranteed but player contracts are not, is the biggest BS in sports.
They should probably bring you in on their Operational/payroll team…. They could be saving money and not even know it
Cardinals are the type of org to charge a $2.95 "convenience fee" for direct deposits.
Kingsbury actually specifically requested that they send him physical checks. The big ones that they use for the lottery.
He's been doing great work as the one corporate analyst guy in the Avatar movies
I'm racking my brain, but I can't think of a worse situation in the NFC. You could argue that the Rams being in cap space hell now is bad, but that's from the payment plan they bought the Super Bowl with. I don't want to say a lot about Washington now, but their situation may look more hopeful in the future.
Things can change quickly though. We all thought Seattle were in a mess last year and will be for a while. A good draft and a decent QB changed all of that.  As always having the right HC leading is the key here.
Not to mention they are the oldest franchise in the NFL, yet only have NFL championships in 1925 and 1947 back when they were in Chicago.
Crazy thing is they have a ‘poor’ owner as well. They’re so unlikely to spend on non salary capped things now.
I went to Phoenix a couple weeks ago. The stadium is really nice 🤷‍♂️
I’d say only other team that rivals them is the browns is watson is still dogshit this season then i’d say the browns have it worse then them
My screaming hot take is they should draft a QB or trade down and trade Kyler post 6/1
Quick list of teams I think are in worse shape:  Browns  ...alright that's all I got.
This is bad owner and bad management.  Like the colts and Irsay.  I heard that Irsay was criticizing the status of the Rams.  lol!  The Rams won a Super Bowl! They can suck for ten years for all the fans care.  Pack them picks.
They should put "Kingsbury Tax" on the printed receipt
>$138.88  With cheese, Mr. Squidward, with cheese
Having a day named after you because you receive a yearly check for a million dollars is the definition of career goals lol
The Atlanta Braves paid Bruce Sutter $1.12 million a year for 30 years and it finally ended in 2022.   Sutter last played for the Braves in 1989.
Fun fact, Bobby Bonilla actually gets this twice a year, he has this arrangement with two different teams.  On top of the Mets, the Orioles are paying Bonilla $500k a year through 2028.
Griffey is one of the highest paid players on the reds still lol
Granted, a large reason for that is because the Mets' owners got involved in Bernie Madoff's ponzi scheme.
At the time, it sort of made sense. The Wilpons were heavily invested in Bernie Madoff's "hedge fund" (read: Ponzi scheme) and believed they'd earn far more from investing Bonilla's salary and deferring payments vs. paying him outright.
Can anyone ELI5 how this happened?
I celebrate it every year! He was my first thought when I saw the title.

No kids? What the hell do you think he’s been doing in Thailand all this time?  Someone a while back commented that in 20 years there’ll be a small Thai village where everyone looks like Kliff.
- Thus far, nothing has indicated he wants another job. He’s chilling on the beach.   - Kyler Murray and Joe Burrow have completely different games. Kyler needs his running to open up his passing. Joe uses it as a tool. Additionally, Joe Burrow is 6” taller than Kyler Murray.
Kingsbury has to forfeit that if he becomes an NFL OC proper so he won't do that.
People loved mentioning bo jackson when they were talking about Tuas hip injury like it wasn't 30 years ago
Unless you’re Derrick Rose lol.   I’m actually crying inside as I typed that.
Truly the wonders of modern medicine and kinesiology are something to behold
but it is something to keep an eye on in regards to Kyler given how he relies on his mobility
I think it’s over stated how quick players can return. Can they play in 8 months? Yes. But unless their Adrian Peterson it still takes pretty much a year or more to get back fully. Look at Saquon. He tore his ACL week 2 in 2020 and didn’t really start to look like he might be returning back to form until week 4 of 2021 and even then he didn’t fully look like he had the confidence or burst back before getting another injury. He himself said he didn’t feel right until after 2021  He looked great in 2022 though. If guys were returning from ACLs in 8 months we would have seen OBJ playing in October
Knee injuries are terrible for athletes. Tons of different types but they can easily be career enders. Look no further than Lonzo Ball who still hasn’t returned from a meniscus tear.
This is true. But the number one predictor of having a season ending injury is previously having a season ending injury.
He's also not a RB or WR so it shouldn't impact him as much either.
Which turned out to be the GM anyway?
Yeah Kyler has a fucking cannon lol
Fair.
It's hilarious how people assume the hyper athletic black QB is just an average passer. Goes to show how little people watch the Cardinals. The only QBs who I'd say have better arms in the league right now are Mahomes, Allen, and Herbert, and the last two can't make the type of off platform throws that Kyler can.
"Hey man, I uploaded my resume to Monster, what else do you want me to do?"
I mean, if they’re bringing in more money for the college, the college can afford more cutting edge academic facilities as well so it goes both ways. But I doubt it super profitable for all schools and is more almost a major marketing budget to attract students
Exceptional enough to embarrass the raiders while the rest of the team plays awful
why they folded and gave him that contract is beyond me lol
Agreed, he's a unique one who throws darts, but he's not winning MVPs until he develops a lot more.
Dude is getting paid to vacation in Thailand, I think he is exactly where he wants to be.
Not really... More like 30k per check..but still
Yeah around week 10.
It’s a byproduct of the salary cap, which obviously doesn’t exist for coaches. I haven’t seen a proposal where NFL contracts are guaranteed and they provide the flexibility GMs want/need for salary cap purposes.
especially since their job doesn't really rely on physical talents that quickly disappear, and that even shitty coaches can almost continually get new jobs through nepotism no matter how incompetent they are.
A player's career can end on one play. Coaches aren't an ACL away from not coaching.
How is he the problem at all 🤣
He didn't kick a player and quit midseason
He was 28-37-1 with the Cardinals. That's not good, but it's pretty much on par with the modern Cardinals with the exception of Arians.   Not only is it not even close to the worst hire in NFL history, it's not even close to the worst hire of 2019 (Kitchens, Fangio, Flores, Gase).
>Kliff Kingsbury was just fired by Texas Tech for having a losing record with Patrick Mahomes as his QB.   That was more on his inability to recruit on the defensive side of the ball. Who the hell wants to go to Lubbock? It's a very hard place to be successful at long term. Even if he had a good DC, they 100% would have been poached after a year.  Remember the last good HC at Texas Tech was fired not because what happened on the field but an incident between him and Craig James' son.  The idea of hiring him wasn't bad at the time since the weaknesses that occurred during his Texas Tech days could be easily overcome by having a GM handling roster management and a DC in full control of that side of the ball.  Unfortunately, NFL adapted to him and he never could built on what he had in 2019.   Hiring him isn't the issue. Giving him the extension is.
Worst hire in history is def a stretch but I agree with the rest. Also had mayfield at TT and still couldn't do anything.
>Possibly the worst hire in NFL history.  nice bait
Not even close to the worst. Matt Patricia with the lions laps him and Urban Meyer is a class of his own
Urban Meyer bro
I remember when Kliff was hired I got downvoted to hell for suggesting that he was a pretty perfect example of the white privilege that exists amongst NFL coaching hires.   Here's a guy who couldn't finish with a winning record in the Big 12 for all 3 of PATRICK MAHOMES led teams. They finished above .500 once (7-6) and lost the only bowl Mahomes ever played in. They lost a game against Oklahoma 66-59 in a game where Mahomes tied the NCAA record with 734 passing yards!   But he was somehow seen as an offensive guru and hired into the NFL despite his abject failure as a head coach, when his only success was a result of having one of the greatest QBs to ever play.   If Kliff wasn't white, young and hot you can't tell me he gets hired to coach the Cardinals.
Wayne Fontes, Romeo Crennel Adam Gase and Rich Kotite are here to see you
Honestly I think listening to a random dude in a bar would be a bigger sign of dysfunction.  But Keim was a much bigger problem than KK anyway.
Fired college football coach is right there
There’s a difference between playing on a sprained ankle and with a torn ACL
Yeah, Watson never played in the NFC West!  What were they thinking grouping these 3 together?!
Bonilla deferred his salary and it was the smartest move he could've made. This Kingsbury contract is comparable to European football managers getting the sack
they should regret wasting a 1st round pick on his replacement when he still had so much gas left in the tank, and giving him a big extension if they weren't planning on putting a team around him to try and make a couple more SB runs.
Young?
I mean a running QB and a scrambling QB are different... Rodgers is a scrambler, Russell Wilson is a scrambler, Ben Roethlisberger was a scrambler, Brett Favre is the most famous example of a scrambler. All of them won Super Bowls. I feel like you stop counting them because they were successful which is you "no true Scotsman"ing the opinion just to prove the point. Tons of scramblers have won super bowls.  And Kyler Murray is a scrambler, not a running QB. I feel like there have only actually been a few running QBs like Vick and Lamar. I feel like Kyler had one season where he was a runner but otherwise has stayed in the scrambler camp
Russ and Rodgers are the closest.  But basically all of the mobile QBs who have won a SB are / were also elite at throwing the ball.  I think when better D coaches and defenses come to town and the weather gets bad, it limits the impact of the mobility.   Overall, people way overestimate the impact of mobility. They think of it as 50/50, rushing and throwing, each are equal. They arent, throwing is 80 and rushing is 20.
Are we differentiating scrambling from running? If not isn't Patrick Mahomes the whole reason for the market?
Elway?
Pounding Thai Orifices?
forgies?
The rumor was 5million guaranteed, so that divided by 104 paychecks
Don’t talk about Kyler like that.
This is almost true. He doesn’t have to take anything less than a head coaching job, though. If he’s a college coach or a coordinator at any level, the Cardinals are on the hook for any salary imbalance he may experience.
NFLPA structure. Coaches get paid biweekly.
Because it demonstrates the difference between the average Americans salary vs what money means to the super rich?
Yes lol
The American dream
Modern day Robert California
He’s doing it right. Best job on earth is a recently fired NFL head coach.
After recently watching the Jared from Subway documentary I hope to fuck he’s having orgies with beautiful of age women.
He's going to appear in Season 3 of White Lotus isn't he
He's gotta leave there soon. Only allowed to stay there 6 months I believe.
>Thailand  Nice  >having orgies  Nice  >with beautiful women  [X](https://youtu.be/ctDjnG8J9cY)
Thailand…. They might not be women
[removed]

Thailand was a weird choice to me tbh… anytime I hear a single guy going to Thailand it’s for one reason…
Who would want to trade Thailand for Omaha, Nebraska
I know this is a joke but these coaches that genuinely love football will always come back to the game. He can't feasibly take 4 years off and then just come back as an OC or HC. He will probably take the year and then see what he can get next year. If it's the right opportunity he probably will return to coaching because you don't get that high up without having a strong love of the game
Not sure on Kliff, but Rhule’s contract stated he had to be actively looking for work and at a market rate. Maybe Tepper is just more shrewd, but they’re still fighting him on a small portion of his buyout.
I’m sure he’d prefer all that corn over the beaches
He already came back within a month to interview for the texans offensive coordinator job and I don't think he got it so he's back in thailand
IIRC Kingsbury is a complete football freak, the sort that likely can't stay away for long
I would run for president then.  That's an attempt right
I would “look” for work but then ask them not to pick me
He should apply to Circuit City
My agent's voicemail box is listening to all offers
When a coach gets fired under contract and hired by another team, the new teams salary deducts from what the old team has to pay out.   So if his contract was $7M APY and the Jets hire him for $4M Arizona would pay him $3M until the contract is over
His salary wouldn’t double, there’s usually offset language so his new coaching salary would reduce the amount the Cardinals have to pay. So he’d make the same money doing nothing as he would working.
No, they offset.  >Guarantees in coaching contracts are offset guarantees, meaning the firing team’s financial liability is reduced if and when the coach secures work and is paid by another team during the term of the contract. While the firing team has an obligation to pay off the contract, the fired coach has a duty to mitigate, meaning he has an obligation to seek and find a similar coaching position with another team (that can be a college team as well).

The NFL team is often responsible for the salary they guaranteed. So if he picks a job that pays 100k a year, cardinals will still pay everyone above
I thought he couldn't.  Could be wrong
It’s contract dependent, but most head coaching salaries are fully guaranteed.
So he will apply for head coaching job in KC every year and not get it.
They would make him D coordinator
imagine being all stressed out because your in over your head at your job and you want to walk away but theres bills to pay then you find out if they let you go you get severance package for a few years haha thats awesome!
Jim Sorgi lived the life as Peyton’s backup
I mean...backup QBs are still really good QBs, just not near the top tier. There are expectations and you still have to put in a ton of work
I want to be a bullpen catcher in MLB.
Alex Moran?
Chase Daniels sends his regards
But that can all change in an instant, and the backup QB then faces the same physical danger as the starter.   I thought of David Humm, who was backup/3rd string QB for 10 years, and got two Super Bowl rings with the Raiders. He had actually retired after the 2nd Super Bowl, but the Raiders called him back the following season, after starter Jim Plunkett was hurt.  The Raiders were facing the Chicago Bears. It was a year before their Super Bowl run, but the defense was just as dangerous. Literally. Starting QB Marc Wilson was knocked out with a concussion after he was blindsided. Humm came in, was sacked, and lost a fumble. Wilson recovered his senses enough to return to action (this was 1984), and banged his thump on a helmet. Humm re-entered. On a third down, he was hit in the face and had two teeth knocked out. He was lying on the ground probably wondering why he agreed to come out of retirement. Fortunately, it was third down, and he had time to get his bearings. On the very next possession, Humm was hit low by a LB and tore cartilage in both knees. His NFL career was over.  During his pro career Humm had surgery on his shoulder, both knees and a hand. QB's definitely get protected more, but the defenders are so big and strong, that the limited hits can still do serious damage.    (As an aside, after Humm suffered the knee injury, the Raiders were out of quarterbacks. Punter Ray Guy was the emergency QB, but he refused to go in, after seeing the beating that Humm and Wilson were taking. Wilson was getting an X ray on his thumb, saw Humm's injury on TV, and ran out of the training room back on the field. He played the rest of the game with a broken thumb.)
Fired coach > backup QB > active coach
Ya, but they still have to show up and practice and contribute to meetings. Fired head coaches literally just get a fat check every couple weeks for absolutely nothing.
Todd Collins was my NFL hero.  15 years, $18.3M in earnings, played in 49 games.  Started 21.  Most of those came from one season when he was a starter for 12-13 games.
Unless your name is [Billy Joe Hobert](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1997-oct-16-sp-43372-story.html)     I would prefer to be a long snapper over a backup QB if I had my choice.
Nah. Watch the QB School YT channel and you’ll see just how much is expected of a backup qb
This is the crux of the show Blue Mountain State.
This man did both
Chase Daniel has made $40M and only taken like 300 snaps in an NFL game. Goat efficiency
You have to go to Blue Mountain State to do that
Chase Daniel is.my idol
Easiest job is up for grabs bow that Peyton Manning's offensive coordinater is no longer available
till you find yourself behind Brock Purdy in the NFC championship game
Not doing work > doing work though
I remember Doug Peterson being a very highly paid kick holder for the Packers.
Nick foles had one of the best careers in the nfl- career back up after a short time starting, come back get a Super Bowl mvp, couple more years as a back up, your rich you get a statue and you barely played in comparison to other qbs who started in super bowls
Tell that to Josh Johnson lol
Still sounds like a lot more work than Kliff is doing
You don't have to use coy terms for jerking off.
Cause they don’t affect the cap
Afaik the CBA's rules around guaranteed money don't apply to coaches, which means that teams dont need to have the cash in hand to put into escrow for coaches like they do players.  IMO the League and the PA need to try and create some sort of insurance system for the fully guaranteed contracts, where teams must purchase an insurance for their contracts so if they end up on hard times, players still get paid their guarantees, and more players can get more guaranteed money because teams only need to have cash on hand for that year plus the premium for whatever new guaranteed contracts, instead of the cumulative total for fully guaranteed contracts.
I'll accept a measly $300k annually
Bill Bidwill Sr. had to overnight ship a game/pay check to a player or executive back in the day and literally deducted the price of shipping from the check 😂
Cardinals are the type of org to install debit card-operated toilets at the stadium, then uninstall them two months later, spending several hundred thousand times as much money as they managed to successfully extort from the first four people who didn't just piss on the floor after realizing that the Cardinals are the type of org to charge a $2.95 "convenience fee" in addition to their 99 cent pay toilet transaction.
Washington is an 6-8 win team at least
Rams salary cap is also only bad this year. We have $60m next year currently
People seriously overestimating how bad the Rams situation is.  We have $55m in cap space next year and all our draft picks. It's not homerism to expect the Rams to be competing in 2024 if Donald/Stafford/Kupp are still around.
I think football wise Washington is good aside from QB because that's still a mystery like always. Our real problem is Dan Snyder and such as it's always been.
Rams have mcvay. That dude has done more with less before.
they can't really change QB's as they just paid one a ton and he's injured.  that's kind of the point.
Yes, let’s not forget the cards were a super bowl contender in 2009.
Respectfully, people were always wrong about Seattle. Pete is one of the longest tenured and winningest coaches in the NFL, we have made the playoffs 10 of his 13 years.
And it can be argued they weren't even the best football team either year
You might want to check your source on that one, I don’t know if Arizona was ever in Chicago
I’m a coyotes fan. Next time you go, hook a brotha up with some swag
The stadium itself is fine, it's just absurdly out of the way for the vast majority of people
Except it’s in Glendale and it’s pain in the ass to get to
Idk why the browns comments are getting downvoted. I agree haha.
I hope he gets flattened every play lol
kyler had one bad year though. I don’t see anyone they are getting at 3 being better when they go to the dumpster fire that is Arizona lol.
Popular take around my circle. We are going to be trash. Take #1 and Draft Caleb, Trade Kyler away since he’s evidently an asshole and start from scratch with Ossenfarts players.
It’s funny how badly the whole Deshaun watson deal has fucked them. Karma
The Browns have way more to work with compared the Cardinals. It of course depends on Watson returning to form (I pray not because fuck him), but I'd those odds over the Cardinals
Do go on…
The funniest thing about that is that the Mets thought they were going to make a huge amount of money off the deal due to Madoff managing it with the phony double digit returns. It was due to Madoff that they didn't just pay him normally but instead offered him 8% thinking they'd be getting 16% and laughing all the way to bank.
Right? Do you think I can convince my company to name the 15th and 30th of every month JPAnalyst day?
Didn’t end because he died?
Third-highest paid player on the team this year.
It made sense at the time!
The Mets released Bonilla in 2000 but still owed him $5.9 million.  Instead of paying him it all upfront, they convinced him to defer the payments over 25 years with 8% interest with a delayed start to 2011  They were heavily involved in Madoffs Ponzi scheme and thought they could make double that interest if they invested it.   Well, that obviously blew up but the team still owes him the money.    These deals really aren’t that uncommon and in reality, if he invested it properly Bonilla likely still would have been better off taking the lump sum up front. For instance if you invest 5.9 million, get an 8% return over 35 years you would have $87million at the end, provided you didn’t withdraw any.  This deal only pays 1.2 million over 25 years which is 30 million, remember the 10 year delay.   So he would have made almost 3x as much if he took the money and invested it.    Also note the S&P return over the last 20 years is closer to 10-12%, which would put a theoretical max value of $311 million.
Mr. Bad Cardinals
Joe Burrow is elite from the pocket. Kyler Murray is average from the pocket.
Kliff interviewed with the Texans for an OC job.   Height has nothing to do with recovery. Kyler is probably one of the most athletic dudes in the NFL.   I’m sure he’ll be fine
* What do you think using a tool means? * Why did you stop at height? Joe is also smarter, better looking, and has more friends * Why do you format your posts like this?
Hahaha saying Kyler needs his running and Burrow uses it as a tool is asinine. Literally saying the same thing.  When Kyler has had any sort of protection he has shown to be a damn good pocket passer, and an especially accurate deep passer. It’s like you all forget those times. The cardinals being a completely shitty team most of the time doesn’t take away from those skill sets. His running is a symptom of a broken team.  Ps I think Joe Burrow is definitely better. I just think the Kyler criticism is far overblown and mostly just shit from talking heads that people regurgitate.
Nah that’s not how it works. Coaching contracts are guaranteed so whatever salary he took from a new job would be deducted from what Arizona has to pay him but he’d still technically make the same amount of money until that contract expires with Arizona.  But you also have to prove you are looking for another job so Kliff can’t just sit in Thailand for the next 4 years and collect all that money. Arizona could request an arbitration hearing with the NFL to get out of paying him the rest of that money.
Except y'all are doing the same thing... like Adrian Peterson came back in 8 months. That is not the default now, that was one guy. Lots of guys have injuries like this nag them the rest of their career
True but it’s not like that’s a common injury for football players at all. That’s the type of injury you sustain in a car wreck, not during a sport.   There’s so few other athletes to compare the injury too outside of Bo
smh
ACL in one knee: doable  ACL in one knee, meniscus tear in other knee, re-tearing that meniscus a year later: not so much
Ugh
Or Lonzo Ball :/
Different position but Bakhtiari didn't exactly rebound quickly either.
Joe burrow tore his ACL started the next year at an all pro level
Yea, i feel people are worse in the reverse now, assuming everyone will somehow be back to 100% in 6-8 months in miracle heal fashion.
I present Jerry Rice. Tore his ACL, came back the same season…
Beckham's 30, though, Murray's 25. And yes, he runs a lot, but ultimately running ability is still more important for a WR than a QB (and Kyler still doesn't run as much as most people think he does).
Lonzo is obviously a complete outlier tho
I don’t think that was ever proven
Of course no one watches them. They suck
Kyler still doesn't have a 4000 yard passing season and can't stay on the field.
Given his resume, he’ll 100% have another coaching job in the next 4 years.
One game does not make an exceptional QB.  Full stop.  Actually it was just one half of one game.
Remarkable, right? I get that the NFL is a QB league—you need an amazing supporting cast if you're going to win the ship with a even an average QB—but for me a QB like Murray has yet to have proven success in the NFL. A couple of years, sure, but long term? Nope.
Murray is a run first QB. He will not develop any further. The only QB like him that I've seen make the switch was Randall Cunningham—and he only did it when his knees were shot. Lamar Jackson needs to make the switch, but I'm not sure if he has the arm. Newton couldn't do it. VY, McNair, Vick... they all failed.
I think you meant for this to be a counterpoint, but to me it's a supporting argument. Why do we need to guarantee contracts for people who aren't risking their future livelihood?  I understand there are salary cap implications that would need to be worked out, but they could figure that stuff out if they wanted to.
Name another player, let alone a franchise player that openly fights with their head coach in the middle of games that no one sees as a problem...
How is that garbage up voted.  Even if you don't like Kyler it's basically inarguable that it's worse than something like drafting Wadsworth, keeping Keim, or bungling the Arians situation.  It's really hard for an NFL contract to kill your franchise because of how owner friendly the labor agreement is. Even the worst case prob puts Kyler at mediocre level QB. Paying elite money for mediocre isn't the end of the world.
100%. The extension was just weird because I think sentiment was we still were unsure whether he was the guy after 2021.  Kk wasn't a disaster signing. Even his extension isn't a disaster since it doesn't affect the cap. His overall record is going to put him in a middle spot for Cardinals coaches.  Bigger issue is Keims AWFUL drafting anyway.
Both Patricia and Meyer were FAR more qualified to be a NFL head coach at time of hiring.
No bro.  Urban Meyer won multiple championships at the college level with Tim Tebow at QB and won another championship with a third string QB. Kliff Kingsbury was unable to have a winning record with Patrick Mahomes at QB.
Kliff's legend as a QB whisperer started with Case Keenum. Solidified with Johnny Manziel. And was venerated with Patrick Mahomes.   It's not like dude had one good player under him as a coach. He took three dudes no one had ever heard of and made them Heisman winning calabre QBs at three different schools in three different conferences.   Don't act like Kliff hadn't proven himself an offensive guru and QB whisperer...he had. The Cardinals just felt like they had an organization that could make up for his head coach shortcomings.  The NFL is going through a generational transition when it comes to head coaches. Examples being Mike Tomlin who started the trend, Sean McVay, Kyle Shanahan, Mike McDaniel... Ect... Ect....  Everyone was looking for the next young generational talent that they can lock into their team for the next two or three decades. Cardinals didn't want to be left out of the competition so they hired their own prospect.  Now....If we want to talk about systemic racism and how only a few privileged rich kids could possibly be in a position to be an NFL head coach prodigy we could have that conversation. But no. Kliff obtained his position based on his knowledge of the game and a demonstrated ability to get top performances out of QBs. Not because he is white and attractive.
Every one of those coaches were far more qualified than Kingsbury at the time of hiring.
Wayne Fontes? You’re trying to say the only Lions head coach to ever win us a playoff game was a bad hire?
2 completely different play styles between them as well
Now if you said Big Ben, Deshaun Watson, and Bill Cosby I can follow the narrative. (It’s a love for Jello Pudding)
Exactly, I’d argue *hard* that Mahomes by definition is a scrambler that’s also elite at pocket passing and we just saw him basically have a perfect accolade year for a QB
Lmao! That's over 3/4 of my yearly salary every week!  I'm laughing to keep from crying.
Lol his rap name
He's trying to become head coach of the Greendale Community College football team so that he can coach Troy Barnes but Pierce Hawthorne keeps getting in the way.
FYI you can do that stuff while you’re broke too tho. With other broke people.
The dream
Close, Ideally it would be on the Cowboys dime.
Kliff "I'm the fucking lizard king" Kingsbury
He's there with his Instagram model girlfriend, so I suspect he's not there as a sex tourist.
Quick rundown?
He could probably just do a border run to a different country nearby then come back
Reddit would have you think that there are no cis women in Thailand...

He is not single.

Well, he did voluntarily live in Lubbock for 5ish years
Damn imagine getting fired from an NFL coaching gig and still having to adhere to the same terms for unemployment checks that everyone else has to
That is a basic part of contract law but is also interpreted very favorably to the employee who had their contract broken.  I'm order to try and not have to pay the full amount the team would have to prove that there was another more or less identical to the cardinals that would not be an inferior or different job that wanted to hire him.
There is no confirmation he is back in Thailand after the interview. Why do people state things as fact, which they cannot confirm? Why do people make things up? Here's an article confirming he "wants to coach and is figuring out his options right now"  https://cardswire.usatoday.com/2023/01/20/kliff-kingsbury-weighing-options-but-wants-to-coach-in-nfl-again/  That was January 20th, when he was in Thailand. Then, on February 10th, not even 3 weeks later, he interviewed with the Texans *in Houston* for their OC position:  https://cardswire.usatoday.com/2023/02/10/kliff-kingsbury-interviewing-for-texans-oc-job/  No story since states he's in Thailand that I've found
The Connor Roy specialty
Lots of people do that to claim unemployment checks
That takes me back. That and compUSA
Yeah the idea that teams are regularly paying coaches to lounge around for years is mostly fiction. People on here act like it’s everyones dream to get paid to do nothing but these guys just aren’t wired like that. Not to mention the contract terms usually say the coach has to be seeking a job.
Not most, all are guaranteed, but they're also offset. Arizona would be off the hook for whatever his new team paid him
Now that's a name I haven't heard in a very long time.
He was almost Eli’s backup too but he got hurt lmao
One of my favorite Jim Sorgi stories is: I worked at the airport that Peyton flew out of. When he was injured one of my coworkers asked Peyton if he was worried about Sorgi putting up better numbers and looking better than Peyton. Peyton responded "the only thing Jim should be worried about is holding my fucking clipboard"  😄
He earned about $5m total. In other words, a third of what Charlie Whitehurst made and an eighth of Brock Osweiler's earnings. Hell, that's what Houston is paying for Case Keenum for a couple years. Sorgi didn't exactly break the bank.
He was no Billy Volek
He was the perfect back up.  He was a coaches kid so he always followed directions and knew the playbook inside and out.  He flat out said he probably wasn't good enough to be a starter when he was drafted so he had no grand illusions or goals of getting signed to some other team as a starter.  He put up solid numbers and didn't make too many mistakes when he did have to play.  Wisconsin has produced several of these type of low key second string quarterbacks.  Scott Tolzien went undrafted and turned that into a 7 year career as a back up in the NFL.  Joel Stave played with 6 teams in 3 years as mostly a 4th string guy.  Brooks Bollinger played 6 years as a 3rd string and did okay.
I wonder how many times the Colts thought about moving on from him but Payton said no
Fired head coach you don't even need to travel with the team, or have any kind of workout. It's free money for years.
Only job where you can be the 33rd best at in the entire world and people think you suck.
Hoyer was a big part of the patriots locker room culture. A real well liked personality
Don't many backup QB's act as the scout team QB? I know I've read stories about a backup QB being a big asset to a team's defense because they were able to emulate specific opposing QB very well.
Yeah, Geno recently said that his job wasn't just to back up Russ, it was to push Russ and make Russ better; which consequently, made him a better QB than when he joined the team.
That sounds like a tough job. I think you gotta give feedback and sorta be another pitching coach. And most pitchers are a little crazy.
Oil change time!!!!
The cap is made up though. The owners are the ones who decided that coaching contracts don't count towards the cap and player contracts do. They could just have easily decided that coach contracts also count towards the cap and coaches would have the same guaranteed/non-guaranteed shenanigans in their contracts that players do.
I'll do it for $100K and free coffee
I hesitate ever picking an NFCE team’s win totals tbh
Also you're still a somewhat competive team. Rams are fine.
Donald will be 32/33 and possibly be retired, stafford is sure to decline heavily if he doesn’t retire and y’all have kupp. 60m in cap space plus picks and 3/4 focal points to have slumped or retired (mcvay) doesn’t amount to much. Hopeful for you guys to come out the other side on both feet since it makes for good division football but I’m not positive
Its more a talent of the whole roster thing but people saying they'll be bad for a decade are being dramatic for sure.
Murray is definitely redeemable. He's shown enough quality.
Murray has the talent to succeed and hopefully the new coaching staff and admin are able to get his head straight
Ya I think everyone knew Pete was a great coach but they thought the squad was too weak to be able to have a winning season. Geno playing well and also having a really good draft alleviated some of those hardships which of course are down to good coaching too.
Don't even pass the eye test.
Getting there was ok. Leaving was a tragic nightmare lol
He doesn’t know. He’s just making up crap 🤣
Worst position in the NFL lol
it upsets me that people always leave this part out
They are still making out.  The average S&P return over the period in question is 12%.  Bonilla could have made a lot more money taking it all up front and investing it.    Though he wouldn’t have the security of not blowing it.
You never know if you don’t ask
I’ll mark my calendar
Yes
It *still* makes sense. It saved the franchise.
Oh wow, thank you.
Just say you don't watch any Cardinals games. Kyler had a ~72% completion percentage in 2021 before he got hurt against Green Bay. He was leading the league in passer rating at that time as well, and he had less than 300 rushing yards in those 8 games where he put up those numbers. He has more arm talent than Burrow; there's a reason he's the only human in history to be drafted top 10 in the MLB and NFL draft.
That’s exactly the problem. Great athletes oftentimes recover from injuries better than most, but when players star because of their athleticism, their game is more damaged by injuries.
I mean another guy I kinda look at is Nick Chubb. Tore his pcl,lcl, and mcl at Georgia and then proceeded to have back to back 1k+ rushing seasons there before going to the nfl and immediately becoming one of the best backs in the league for like 5 years now. Peterson is the example used the most just because of the mvp win and everything
Yeah, there’s a huge list of guys who either didn’t come back playing well or ended up with another injury because they were compensating for their knee
Right it took him 9 months with no set backs but he also doesn’t rely on his legs like Kyler does. Burrow rushed for 118 yards the year after his ACL. 257 is the most he’s rushed for in his career and that was last season.   Kyler needs his legs to make things happen and it looks like he’s not going to be ready to start the year.  The amount of players able to come back to full form in under a year is not a long list. Usually, they’ll improve as the season goes on and they’re further away from surgery. So I agree it’s not always a full year before they’re playing but a lot of guys are still getting back to form while playing
Joe burrow doesn’t rely on his legs to make him an elite level talent.
He doesn’t run anywhere near as much as hurts or fields but he still runs on a per pace for 100+ attempts per year which puts him around the top 5 Running QBs. It’s more of the point that his mobility opens up his passing and if that’s not there it’s going to impact his game as defenses play him differently
67% cmp percentage 107td to 41int is pretty damn exceptional now factor in that he’s had a well below average Oline his whole career and an OC/HC that couldn’t cut it at the college level. He’s been excellent even with a bad supporting cast
Because it's a higher risk that you're paying someone to not work for you. It's not compassionate, but business is all about risk/reward, not compassion.
your head coach was fucking garbage lol.
Been saying this for two years.. Once I saw how bored and annoyed he looked in the 2021 playoffs, I immediately wrote him off.
there’s so much hate against kyler it’s ridiculous lol
Look at my cousin. He's broke, don't do shit!
Yeah but they'll be just as fat and ugly as me. I do not look like Kliffy.
The broke equivalent is meth by the Motel 6 pool with busted hookers
You can straight up go on a months long bender in Thailand with a few thousand USD let alone millions lol.  Source: taught in Thailand for 6 months

Except the Cowboys don't get rid of head coaches very often. Even when they should.

The other dude in the Jared doc shacked up with a good Christian mom of two and a few years later she was banging horses and trying to let her bf sleep with her kid daughters.  You never know
Then why go there? There are other countries in SEA with similar scenery and culture.
Dude went to Thailand regularly to have sex with kids, to include letting a 10 year old boy fuck him.  Yea it’s a tough, tough watch.  That dude is a wayyy bigger garbage human than I ever knew.
He's a sick fuck and the audio tapes legitimately make my skin crawl.
Be careful where you store your sandwich.
Guy named Jared dropped a lot of weight by switching from greasy fast food to eating Subway all the time.  Was a big enough story that Subway made him a spokesperson and had him in a bunch of advertisements.  Few years go by and turns out he was a pedophile, using his fame to solicit pictures of underage girls.
Maybe, but I think you have to be out for  1 or 2months if I'm not mistaken... I'm sure a month or two and Vietnam wouldn't be so bad either

Connor Roy was interested in politics from a very young age.
Knew a few people from back in the day that would do the ol’ unemployment grift. Apply for jobs way outside their skill level as “actively looking”.
It all depends on what you mean by "nothing".  KK gets to pursue whatever he wants without the worry of where his next paycheck is coming from, that, IMO, is the American Dream.  With his salary, he can hire a couple analysts and set up a high level film study/analytics shop.  His work and pursuits are completely divorced from his income - he can do anything he wants.
Also he put up really solid numbers when he actually played too, surprisingly
He's got a TD:INT ratio most NFL qbs would kill for.   6:1  6 total touchdowns. 1 total INT
No, he’s not dead.  Not yet, anyway.
His return as Archie Jr.'s backup shall be glorious.
Oh yeah 5 mil, thats chump change. I don’t think I could even afford my 2nd yacht if I only had that much money.
$5m, but he also played long enough to get a pension and health insurance through the union. And got to start a second life at age 30. Many of us won't be that lucky after 30 years of work.
People go after like Kirk Cousins and he’s a top 15 QB
Bullpen catchers make $300k a year and never have to do anything important. I read a story about how most do not even go out until the 4th inning and just watch the game from the dugout
Yeah, I thought it would be a easy job too. Then i learned those guys are essentially coaches.
Imagine catching bullpen for Max Scherzer
Also having a ball thrown towards your face at 98 mph. It just takes missing that thing once…
Fuck, I'll do $125k and no coffee. I just crunched the numbers and that saves $30k each year. Just trust me.
The cardinals don't offer free food. Offer declined.
NFCE Div Winners from 2013-2019 and their record prior year   2013: Eagles 10-6, 4-12  2014: Cowboys 12-4, 8-8  2015: Washington 9-7, 4-12  2016: Cowboys 13-3, 4-12  2017: Eagles 13-3, 7-9  2018 Cowboys: 10-6, 9-7  NFCE is a crapshoot.
The only thing that's certain is that you guys won't win the division
In my opinion Stafford is the only question in terms of if he’ll still be like his old self.   Donald might retire, it’s true. But I have no problem believing he’ll be productive even at 32/33 he’s shown no signs of slowing down.   Like I said in my previous comment, if they’re still here it’s not out of the realms of possibilities for the Rams to be a contending team in 2024.   We also have a few key youngsters to keep an eye on.
We've got some promising young players and can pursue free agents at positions of need next year. Honestly, the only position on our team I'm worried about is Edge Rush. Obviously there's Stafford's health question but I'm not going to lose sleep over that. If he's cooked he's cooked it is what it is we owe like 50m gaurenteed in both of the next two years so nothing to be done about that.
but what about my personal bias that Kyler doesn't care about football
hes not even redeemable. He has a cannon for an arm and runs a 4.3 and at one point either this season or last, he completed the most risky tight window throws in the entire league. Kyler Murray is a top 10 QB and I am not even a cardinals fan.
The problem isn't his talent. It's his injury that's going to sideline him at least half of the season while still being paid $40 million and a team that has a lot of holes to fill.
How so?
It's the best part of it to me. The Mets thought they'd make something like $60M if they could convince Bobby Bonilla to do this but instead they lost tens of millions while Bobby Bonilla is able to ride off into the sunset having champagne wishes and caviar dreams. Oops!
Sure, but even banks can loose all your money
How though? Instead of paying him 5.9 million they chose to pay him 29.8 million later. Is that just because it allowed them to keep good players in their cap?
You’re acting like Kyler can’t throw. His entire game isn’t his legs, it’s just an option.   He has a cannon for an arm and led the NFL in deep ball accuracy like a year ago lol
Ojabo tore his achilles tendon at a pro day and played 7 months later. Basketball Durant tore his achilles and looks like he never missed a beat. Like yes it will vary between guys but medicine is getting much better yearly
Kyler doesn't rely on his legs as much as you think he does. He's a pretty great pocket passer when he has decent protection.  He ran (scrambled) more last year because the OL was awful, just like Burrow's Bengals in 2021.
You do use your knees quite a bit tho lol
Kyler shouldn't need to either, he's that talented as a pocket passer, and yes, he's really a pocket passer first and foremost. (Source: Am lifelong Sooners and Cardinals fan).  This might be a blessing in disguise for him. Just needs to study a bit more and they need to get him protection, so that he can get through his reads without being forced to bail and rely on his unreal speed for a QB.  Study more and get him protection and there's no reason he can't be the next Aaron Rodgers. Kid has a lot of talent.
Kyler Murray will be out out of the NFL in three years.
But then why guarantee coaches contracts instead of tying to incentices like years actually coached? The owners seem to totally disregard the risk reward calculation for them.  Ultimately, I understand why owners want to be able to get out of players contracts whenever they want, but there's enough money to guarantee a good chunk of players contracts and the NFLPA should be embarrassed they haven't been able to achieve something like that.

Oh fuck, that's sick af. Yeah I'm a pass on that documentary
That's five dollar fucked up.
How does that tie into kingsbury or Thailand, I guess is my question
I know that for some countries you can leave and come back the next day, idk how it is in Thailand though. Would really be a shame if he had to go spend some time in Singapore or Koh Samui.
I knew people who spent years I'm thailand doing border runs a few times a year.
Yeah to be clear I don’t feel bad for him lol I just think the idea of him sending copies of job applications to the Panthers so he can get his payout is funny
"I just need a quick $100 mil"
>  ol’ unemployment grift.  I am hesitant to use the word "grift" for something, in my experience, barely hits $100/week.
He actually can’t. Most (all?) [NFL coach contracts](https://www.si.com/.amp/nfl/2022/01/19/business-of-football-end-of-season-coaches-fired) require the coach to look for a comparable job in order to receive the offset payments. It’s difficult to prove but also rarely needed because most of the guys who become a head coach are going to try to get another coaching job, regardless of contact requirements.
The best QB to wear #12 for the Colts
That’s what everyone misunderstands. To be a career backup you gotta still be a top 50 player at your position and incredible in the film room.
Now I half hope he has a nephew who will be Archie’s backup.
5 mil ain’t going far in the yachting world
More like bottom 15
You wear gear even as a bullpen catcher they dont take it away from you lol
Even with a mask, that's going to leave a mark. Or a concussion.
😂 sadly I think I trust your numbers over whatever the hell the Cardinals are doing…..
No it's not, in craps you can actually roll the same number twice in a row
Damn the giants really haven’t won it since 2011.
Why y’all downvoting him, he’s right 😂  NFCE Chaos Voodoo will not be denied!
I have no clue about the reality of the Kyler situation, but Hard Knocks did not do him or Kliff any favors. I can rationally understand it's a TV show, but my brain still thinks Kyler doesn't care at all and that Kliff puts in 140 hour work weeks, but can't say anything but "you played hard" when the team loses.
You’re not just not a Cardinals fan, you’re a 49ers fan. Means a lot, thank you. It’s hard to show him appreciation toward him around these parts. People really hate him.
Employing a criminal as Qb to a fully guaranteed top of market contract when he also sucks. Oh and the entire viewership of the league, including some of their own fans, hate them.   Anything else?
I would think having a serial sexual assaulter as the face of the franchise would qualify a team for the discussion.    I've seen teams with far worse rosters than the Browns not have to deal with a mass exodus of fans.
KD also took a year off after he tore his Achilles.  Being able to come back to form eventually vs. Coming back to form under a year are two different set of expectations  Sometimes it's mental too. Even if a joint, lig, tendon, etc. can return back to strength, the athlete may not trust it or feel the same, and have a hard time getting their technique back
Ojabo playing last year was crazy I was sure when we picked him that he was gonna be out the full year. KD kinda gets hurt with more regularly than he used to since the torn Achilles but every time he’s out there on the floor he still looks like old KD which I was worried about when the injury occurred so it’s a great sign. Kawhi looks great again as well after tearing his acl in 2021
KD tore his right Achilles tendon, which is his non-dominant foot. It's not a coincidence that the only other good NBA player who was able to recover from their Achilles to their pre injury form was Dominique Wilkins, who also tore his Achilles in his non-dominant foot.
If he was healthy he’d be in the top 5 of rushing attempts for a QB each of the last 3 years since he had 133 in 2020 and was on pace for 100+ rushes the last two seasons he didn’t play a full schedule. 2020 was the year he ran the most by far with 11 tds and 800 yads . I’m not saying he relies on it, but it’s a big part of how defenses play him and if they’re not going to worry as much about him leaking out it’s going to change the coverages he sees.  Either way I expect him to recover since he’s so young, but he tore that knee in December so expecting him back at the start of the year is a bit overly optimistic.
I mean he’s averaging like 90 attempts for 550 yards and 6 TDs per year on the ground. That’s a lot of production with his legs, regardless of his pocket passing ability.
RemindMe! 3years
Wtf are you smoking
Look yes kyler has maturity issues but he is a good player outside of last year. Im not saying he’s perfect but there is so much wrong with Arizona blaming him is just not fair lol

He flew to Thailand to sexually abuse minors and would regularly boast about it to people. Its recorded and awful. A documentary on him came out recently so there's been a lot more visibility in to his level of fucked upness.
I get your point, but Koh Samui is in Thailand.
1% keeps him in the conversation
I was unemployed during the first 7 months of the pandemic, but I was getting like $900 a week from the unemployment.  It was amazing.  I was applying for jobs daily but that kinda money in my mid 20's was insanely good.
In Washington, it depends on what you were making at your most recent job, but goes up to $999/week.
The absolute disrespect to "The 20 yard man" Jim Bob Taylor. Literally 0 of his career pass attempts touched the ground.
Surprised to see he only played 6 seasons.
Arguably I think if the starter likes you and is successful that could be even more important. If it’s a marginal starter, yeah you’ve got to be topnotch in breaking plays down, but if Peyton likes you and suggests keeping you, the org might take a “if it ain’t broke don’t fix it” strategy and keep you signed even if you aren’t a film savant.
Yeah, I’ve got 5 mil(ligrand) 😎

At this point its a tradition
I think its washingtons turn around the sun too so they supermax howell before the field kills him
The hates overblown. He's a good qb and the only reason I like playing him is cause he's not colt mccoy
They’re still not in a worse position than the Cardinals. Watson’s also a piece of shit but we’re talking about how well the team is situated, not their moral failings.
That makes their team bad? No, their roster is very good and same with their coaching staff. They’re in a good position to succeed. Just cause you don’t like the Browns because of Watson doesn’t make their team suck 😂
> I would think having a serial sexual assaulter as the face of the franchise would qualify a team for the discussion.  The discussion is about their competitive positioning, not their obvious moral failings.
To your last point, two ACL injuries in a row ended Jamaal Charles' career
I didn't like the players they brought up when talking achilles injuries because most on the list were past their primes
Yes, because he has a bad offensive line and Kliff over-relied (in part because he had to with a bad OL) on his legs to get things going. He's done it plenty in AZ, but it's not really who he is, it's poor OL play and poor playcalling, not allowing him to sit in the pocket and utilize his amazing deep ball. At Oklahoma, he was at his best as a pocket passer with the threat of an occasional called run or scramble.  I don't think we're talking about the same topic. No offense intended, but you're telling me what *he's done* in the NFL as a runner, and I'm talking about *what he's best at*, not what he's done/how he's been misutilized. Kliff abused him as a runner because he couldn't call good plays, get receivers open, or protect him with subpar OL. At OU, he was basically Aaron Rodgers in the pocket, and Michael Vick for 2-3 called runs a game. That's how he's best used, he's way more talented as a passer than Vick or Lamar Jackson.  I don't doubt that a week 1 return is overly optimistic, just saying he's less of a runner at his best than people think. I'm a lifelong  Sooners and Cardinals fan, fwiw.
Three years ago how did you feel about Cam Newton?   And now?  Lamar Jackson unless he changes his game is on the way out as well.
He’s not the problem. He’s just one of many
Hell yeah!

I did a six-month webdev bootcamp that I graduated from basically the moment lockdown started in 2020. Took me 9 months of applying during lockdown but eventually I got a dev job at a state university that I've had for over two years now. Pay is modest (but much more than I was making before), benefits are excellent, I could definitely make more elsewhere now that I have some experience if I really cared to, but meh. The job's pretty chill.  So yeah, bootcamps can be good, you can also see if your current job will pay for one (though they will expect you to become an engineer for them if they do, you're not legally required to tho), otherwise you can self-teach with free resources like codecademy (to a point) or Khan Academy etc but then you'll need to put together a really robust portfolio for prospective employers.
Don't. Chatgpt is going to take many of these jobs in the near future

Those greedy fucks are squeezing his percent
To get to that, though, you have to have had two quarters of pay and then multiply them by .0385.  To get to $900+ dollars, I will have had to post two quarters of around $80,000 each.  That's 80 **per quarter,** not yearly salary.  So, I could have spent a half a year and made 160k in that time, and I'd be able to receive, potentially $900 a week in unemployment.  All of this is suffice to say that I don't think a lot of people in Washington state are pulling $900/week in unemployment after making 27k a month.
Show me where I can buy a nice boat for 12k and I’ll buy it right now
Football players get injured. When was the last time you heard of a catcher getting injured by a pitch?
A ball to the facemask hardly ever happens. These guys are pros. The only time it does is off the bat which isn't happening in the bullpen.
It’s worked out pretty well for them tbh
Exactly, we've got a SYSTEM

Seriously the guy was considered an MVP candidate in 2021 before he got hurt. A good coach and decent supporting cast and he’ll be contending for MVP. People should at least be open-minded.
The post was about a team buying out their nfl coach after recently extending them and having a big contract injured Qb a which puts them in a bad position. I’d say the browns situation qualifies personally.  Owing Kingsbury money doesn’t hurt the team, just the owner
As a Vikings fan, I can personally tell you the browns coaching staff is not good.   Also I mentioned elsewhere I was talking specially to the entire organization, in addition to the browns being poorly set up from a roster standpoint.
if kyler was in a well run org the story would be so much different lol

The problem with bootcamps is that a lot of employers do not like hiring bootcamp grads with no other experience.  There's such a wide variance in quality of camps (some are absolute dogshit), and even a lot of better ones are pretty laser targetted on what businesses want *now*, which won't be what they need 2 years from now.  One of my best workbuddies from my last job went the bootcamp route and he said that most of his fellow graduates never actually got a job in the field when he looked em up on linkedin years later.

Not sure how you're getting these numbers but that is wrong. You need to be coming off an annual salary of about $104k to get max benefits.  Edit: guys, this is all really easily verifiable information. Go [here](https://esd.wa.gov/unemployment/calculate-your-benefit). You can do the math yourself--divide the max benefits, $999 per week, by 0.0385--to see that you need to have averaged $25,948.05 in income per quarter over the last two quarters (in other words, about $104k annually, like I said above and like how normal people talk about their salaries) to receive max benefits.   Or just use the handy calculator that the other poster is pointing out and apparently didn't bother to test.
12k is like a 16' boat used needing tons of maintenance if that. If this man is getting a 28' boat I need to know where.
Trick question, baseball players get hurt in stupid ways like playing guitar hero or tripping over their dogs
In 2018 MLB commissioned a concussion study for the 2017 year. Among other things the study found that catchers had received 21 concussions the previous year from being hit by balls (reminder that the MLB has 30 teams). Backlash was so bad that the MLB designed new catcher helmets to help protect the players.  Or was that a rhetorical question?
Yeah but I’m not a pro, so if I was in a position to either be a bullpen catcher or a journeyman quarterback, I’m gonna probably die either way, so I’ll take journeyman quarterback and pray every week for my starters health lol

> The post was about a team buying out their nfl coach after recently extending them and having a big contract injured Qb a which puts them in a bad position. I’d say the browns situation qualifies personally.  OP said they were in the worst position in the NFC, and someone else suggested the NFL, which is what the discussion is about. Obviously Watson is a piece of shit, but that doesn’t hurt their position in terms of the teams placement competitively. Watson also hasn’t played very well, but he’s not injured and the rest of the team is better than the Cardinals.
As a Vikings fan who did you guys have besides Stefanski? Just curious cause he was also your guys OC not HC. So I’m not sure what point you’re trying to make. And what issues do you see with their roster? I’m curious.
Chicks dig dudes with money.
It does the same thing lol
There's literally a calculator on their web site.  Their benefits don't go by year, it goes by quarter.
People fail to understand having one player who’s a bad apple doesn’t make their entire team bad. They have a great roster and solid coaches. They just hate the Browns because of Watson and just like saying that the browns suck.
I would rather be the cardinals on or off the field , personally, for the next few years. I still feel like the spirit of the post calling out Kingsbury and OP responding in this thread suggests it isn’t strictly being measured in wins and losses, and is more so which teams is generally in the shittiest position and a “mess”.    The browns are sunk with a mediocre coach, expensive roster, no draft capital, and for the off field things I mentioned. So we can disagree just my opinion.
He doesn’t have any answers. The second you actually look at our roster people should be able to see the decent potential there  All he knows is Watson=bad
Pats have an extensive history of trading back from their first pick. Getting Gibbs in a trade back scenario is pretty realistic.
Also known as the "Piss Off the Patriots Fanbase" Speedrun
They could also be scouting these guys as "the bar" to compare later round RBs to.  You can't really understand a draft class without having an idea of who's at the top, even if you aren't necessarily targeting those players.
The Pats have quietly [invested much more](https://www.patspulpit.com/2022/5/9/23063480/nobody-loves-drafting-running-backs-as-much-as-bill-belichick-patriots) into the running back position than most since Belichick became coach there, he also was with the Jets when they went all out and took Curtis Martin from the Pats.  If Bijan goes before 20 it feels like New England is the place
Is "quietly" the new descriptor for anything that people aren't talking about ad nauseam? "So and so is quietly having a great season." "Team A is quietly interested in player A." Just say the thing without adding quietly. It's quietly an  unnecessary part of sports media.
If it’s leaking out like this, it’s probably not happening.
If we use our highest first rounder in I don’t know how long on the least valuable position in football, which is also one of our few positions of strength, I am hopping on the anti-BB bandwagon
ok... what the hell does blue chip mean? I thought I knew, but now I'm not so sure.
Showning
Bill is just going to limit Mac to three throws a game like he did against the Bills.   Somehow they will still go 7-10
We will not draft an RB in the first two rounds, that’s just ridiculous. Our entire offense ran through Rhamondre last year, he’s extremely talented. We also took a few vet trades with RBs. Our RB room is fine and we have much bigger needs in WR / CB / OT.
Idk if they will select an RB at 14 but honestly their defense was pretty good last season and its hard to see them not doing more to build their offense this year
Maybe they mean someone who likes blue corn chips so much it's part of their personality?
Patriots gonna draft another Bama RB? As a Bama fan it’d be cool to watch but watching the Patriots these days is like dragging nails on a chalkboard
Tank Bigsby is gonna end up with the best career after multiple teams spend top 40 picks on Bijan and Gibbs lol. That’s how this shit often seems to work
Cool so they’ll have no OL to run behind.
Bijan on the pats would be pretty badass ngl
Jahmyr Gibbs makes a LOT of sense
Bijan would be the best RB Bill has had since Corey Dillon and when he had Dillon he gave him 360 touches to the tune of 1,700 yards and 13 TDs. People say Bill hates RBs but I think the reality is that he just hasn't had a lot of great ones since Dillon
Great. I just saw his highlights and read the comments on youtube and now I'm going to be disappointed when we don't draft him lol.
That would be a killer pickup.
They probably trade down and draft a safety.
No
Gibbs is absolutely the kind of back that Belichick loves
Gibbs makes a ton of sense but so does most of the rb depth of this class, guys like tank bigsby are bill belichick specials
What intrepid and brave journalism this is
Bill is well known for stating and telegraphing his draft moves. Trust me bro.
who was their first blue chip back? like ever?
Pats boutta reach on an RB
At this point, the Pats should take the field with an o-line and nothing but RBs.
This is some Nike shit.
Nobody knows who the Pats are drafting. This is speculation, not news .
Bill still thinks it's 1989. My goodness if he uses another top 40 pick on a running back he should be fired on the spot.
I could see the Pats trading back into the 20s and drafting a guy like Zay Flowers and then using those extra picks to draft Gibbs in the second round. I wouldn't love it since offensive tackle and CB are much bigger needs than running back, but I wouldn't hate it either.
They have too many needs, a blue chip RB is a luxury they can't really afford.
Lions trade up and nick Kincaid out from under Green Bay? Yes please
idk, I kinda like the idea.
Honestly getting an awesome playmaker on offence wouldn't be a bad thing.   If they don't like the avaliable lineman at that spot, I don't hate it.   Personally I don't trust any of the first round wr prospects
Bill and Nike have been doing that for years now in the war room.
I mean picking a running back prior to Day 3 pisses off every fanbase these days.
That’s not hard to do
Yup, same thing with the Pats meeting all of the top WR prospects pre draft. Could mean that they’re going to take one, could mean that they’re trying to determine how much of a drop off in talent there is between day 1 and day 3 of the draft.  The Pats have had contact with most of the prospects that are projected to go from 10-25ish. Definitely just doing our due diligence here.
The problem is that the Patriots have much bigger needs at tackle and WR (something that is shown through the Top 30 meetings the Pats have had) and we already have Rhamondre so we don't need another high level back.
Honestly think it'll be the Falcons. Huge believers in BPA, love running the ball, Patterson is getting old, GM said they needed to add to the room but no additions were made in free agency.
They haven't really. Sony Michel was a late 1st and Damien Harris was a late 3rd, otherwise every other back has been 4th round or later. That's not much to commit.
Lots of that analysis is based on Sony Michel.  When there's only been 7 first round picks in the time period, that's a big chunk of value according to the draft chart.  Other than Michel the Patriots have taken  1 3rd rounder, 2 4th rounders, 1 6th rounder  That's not exactly a king's ransom.    A later round pick is a cheap way to get a cheap player who can then be discarded once they start showing signs of breaking down.  We let Harris walk after missing half the year.  Before that Michel was traded after year three for a 5th and 6th.
This is quietly the best comment in here.
Sports reporting is the same twenty buzzwords/phrases being regurgitated ad nauseam. Not a ton of creativity there
There are a lot of really annoying words reporters use to report nothingburgers for clicks. “Rumors,” “mumblings,” “talks amongst scouts/executives,” “wouldn’t be surprised if,” “not ruling out the possibility of,” etc.
If doing something "quietly" just means not outright talking about it to the media, then go ahead and add that descriptor to everything Belichick has done since he took over as HC/GM of the Pats. He's as tight-lipped as they come
Patriots have been a sieve lately. So many leaks from Bill, Kraft, Patricia, Jones, etc
Typically refers to a 4* or 5* HS recruit, outside of that it's just an synonym for "highly-coveted." I haven't ever heard it in the NFL to refer to a specific set/tier of players, as the tweet implies. 🤷
I was very, very confused by that one.
I too have Rhamondre in dynasty and am trying to cope.
I mean, only two teams can get Bijan and Gibbs, technically that is multiple.
It doesn’t though? We drafted 2 RBs last year and signed Robinson…drafting an RB early would be such a waste.
Rhamondre just put up 1400 yards on less than 300 touches. Not quite Dillon numbers, but he had a damn good season on a dysfunctional offense. Spending a first-round pick on a rb would be such a waste of assets when this team has more glaring needs.
A while back, a reporter asked Belichick about not having a workhorse and relying on running back by committee, and why he preferred that.  Bill sarcastically asked the guy if he remembered Corey Dillon from 2004, and the guy said yes, and Bill said something like "Well, if Corey Dillon from 2004 was on the roster, he'd get 300 carries.  Haven't seen him out there on the field lately, though, have you?"
Heard the same thing said about Michel and Rhamondre lmfao
Only positive there is we have some success with later round/undrafted CBs and OL
I wouldn't worry about CB. This is a deep CB draft and Belichick already has a track record of developing late round CBs.
ZAY ZAY ZAY ZAY
They have running backs coming out of their ears for Christ’s sake.
I don't think we're going for Kincaid, we'll probably draft another defensive player because eventually that will work out right? Lmao
Maybe one day the Bills will get a ring and you’ll be less salty.
The Patriots have shown they can win with any kind of offense, defense, etc. You get them great players and BB will find a way to make it work.  Bijan is a great player. He would thrive on that team, and it would take a lot of pressure off of Mac Jones.
Bills fans should be hoping that the Patriots have \*just\* a good enough draft to keep Belichick in the GM slot.
On one hand I agree. But our best player on the team is already a RB. So from that perspective it would be a bit of a waste.
The value just isn't there for RB's. They have solid running. The passing game is what sucks.   Even if they got Robinson  1. They won't shift from their RBBC mentality 2. He isn't something that puts them over the top.  3. Even if I'm wrong on the first two, there is a a better chance of me shitting out a new lighthouse for Gillette Stadium than there is of Bill bothering to pay him after his rookie contract.
>Definitely just doing our due diligence here.  "Definitely"??? How would you know. Seems like you're "definitely" trying to cope with the idea.  Patriots have a history of over-drafting the RB position.
As a Falcons fan how would you feel about that? From what I understand Bijan is perhaps the best overall player in the draft.
Lawrence Maroney, signing Antowain Smith, trading for Corey Dillon, taking running backs in the second and third round of the same draft, etc.  In terms of investing in running backs there aren't too many who've done it more since 2000 then New England.
2 is indeed multiple lol
Gibbs has more talent than any of the RBs on our roster IMO, and his style is different than Stevenson. He’s a great pass catcher too. He also already has done work under a BoB scheme since he’s from Bama.
I think the best use of our picks would be on OL/WR and then after that either Pass Rush or CB. Ideally we address the OL/WR with the first couple of picks.
Rhamondre needs a better 4th quarter nickname. That bar is a high one, though…
Yeah Thuney was a 3rd, Onwenu a 5th, Shaq Mason was a 4th. There’s obviously no guarantee but we have a decent track record there.
I was gonna say, no way BB does this. Those 2nd rounders are reserved for DBs lol
Evan Lazar also brought up an interesting idea that maybe the Pats would gravitate towards drafting CBs in later rounds that fill roles they are deficient in instead of trying to find a Gilmore/Revis type that can do it all.    Taking Riley Moss for a bit of length and potential to transfer to S and then getting a press man guy like Trice Jr. to fill that gap on the defense.  Hell, given their track record there's a pro bowl CB bagging groceries right now that's going to get a call after the draft.
The reason they allowed players to wear jersey number "0" was so Buffalo would feel included by seeing representation of how many super bowls they have won.
"With any kind of offense"  You mean with Tom Brady
They’re flush at RB.
I feel like Bill values talent over "need" in most cases but man, RB's in today's game are just not worth a lot of draft capital. Even if we didn't have Stevenson - putting a 1st or 2nd towards a RB seems foolish to me personally.
Dugger is better than Mondre.
Literally the entire league has a history of over-drafting at RB
It's not my dream pick by any means, but I'd be excited to see what Arthur Smith can cook up with 2 fantastic running backs + top 5 rushing o line. It would also mean both Bijan and Allgeier have less injury risk, and in addition, Bijan is an extremely safe choice. He's essentially guaranteed to be top 10 at his position, which you can't really say for any other player
Fucking hate it and I want the rest of the fanbase that wants bijan to share their drugs.
Now you're moving the goal posts.  First of all, that article only mentions **drafting** and it only goes back five years, conveniently stopping before 2017 which had two RBs go top-10 and another two go in the 40s.  But let's *actually* break it down:  Do you know how many RBs Belichick has drafted in the first two rounds of the draft? Three. Make it the first three rounds and that number goes up to six. That's it. I'd hardly call that investing.  Also, do you know how many RBs Belichick has drafted in the top-20? Zero.  And that doesn't even go into the financials of it all, considering Belichick doesn't pay running backs.  They really haven't invested much in the RB position at all.
We need other positions so much more than we need RB. Drafting a RB anywhere in the top-100 would be a waste.   OL, CB, WR, TE, LB are all way bigger needs. Adding another DL guy also never hurts.
The issue is that all that success has come on the interior of the line, and our needs right now are clearly at OT, which is exponentially more difficult to fix with a later pick.
Scar turned Stephen Neal into a solid O lineman and he didn't play a snap of college ball.  I'm not so sure about late rounders now.
Those guy aren’t tackles though, and frankly interior lineman talent is leaps and bounds more available after the first round or two of the draft than tackle
That's one of the benefits of a shit draft for S and a good draft for CB compared to the other way around. If you're willing to take the gamble, it can work out quite well.   Granted, I'm still recovering from my own team moving players out of their actual position and that failing so ymmv.
Yeah can you imagine the embarrassment of losing that many in a row? It’s almost comical. More sad than comical though.
I'm thinking of that game recently in the snowstorm where they ran it....every play. BB has had a few of those, more than any other coach I can recall.
He for sure does. And I'm good with that in most cases. But damn, RB is just different. There's way too many good 2-3-4 round backs. Bijan might be the exception as he can catch as well. But he's still mainly a runner. So we'd still have to take Rhamondre off the field to use him. And yeah people shat on taking a guard in the first round. But a really good OL can make a mediocre RB look good. A great RB will still struggle with a bad OL.
I'd literally rather sign the corpses of Melvin Gordon or Ezekiel Elliott to back up Mondre than spend a first or second on a RB while Trent Brown is our left tackle.
As a massive Texas fan I can’t wait to see you eating crow when you absolutely adore Bijan for the next 5 years
>Now you're moving the goal posts.  >>The Pats have quietly invested much more into the running back position than most since Belichick became coach there   I said invested, not drafted, although even by just drafting standards Bill has put more resources into the position than most.  I provided the article to show the draft part of it and subsequently mentioned the Curtis Martin mega signing his mentor Parcels orchestrated.  You're on some insane level of denial right now, you might as well say their interest in Bijan is a smokescreen
Don't think any Bills fans are embarassed losing 4 in a row.  The accomplishment of getting to 4 in a row outweighs any embarrassment.  No other team has been to 4 in a row, so that helps alleviate the sting a tad.  I honestly think losing back to back, or losing 3 would be worse, 4 is just like "alright, you're committed to this storyline, well done I guess"  Obviously there's sadness, and then even more since it was shit for a long time after that, but embarrassment def isn't part of that.
They threw it three whole times.
Yeah that works if they get to play against our horrible run D every game
The people shitting on drafting Strange in the 1st don't realize he would've been gone shortly after to either the Bucs or the Rams who both had interest in him.   I'd rather we draft for a position of need and get the guy we want even if it's a "reach" rather than have to settle for the 3rd-5th option that we might have to settle for the next time we're up to select our pick.
> although even by just drafting standards Bill has put more resources into the position than most.  This is factually incorrect, though. I gave you the numbers above indicating Belichick does not spend a lot of valuable draft capital on RBs.  >subsequently mentioned the Curtis Martin mega signing his mentor Parcels orchestrated  Belichick is not Parcels.
Either you’re lying or you’re extremely optimistic. Any normal Bills fan would have gladly traded all the runner up awards to have one win.
Getting a 25 point lead in the superbowl is a great accomplishment. How many other teams have had a 25 point lead?
The problem with drafting for need is you might pick up the 5th best option at that position, instead of the second best player at a position you don't need as much. I'd rather go with best player, with RB having some sort of downgrade in that formula
>> although even by just drafting standards Bill has put more resources into the position than most. > >This is factually incorrect, though. I gave you the numbers above indicating Belichick does not spend a lot of valuable draft capital on RBs.  You might be the most in denial poster I've come across recently.  >Do you know how many RBs Belichick has drafted in the first two rounds of the draft? Three. Make it the first three rounds and that number goes up to six. That's it. I'd hardly call that investing.  Traded a second for Corey Dillon, four picks in the first two rounds at running back is a lot.  He's also has gone out and signed running backs and prioritized re-signing guys.  >Also, do you know how many RBs Belichick has drafted in the top-20? Zero.  How many times have Pats picked in the top 20 last 23 years?  4?  C'mon man
That's not what I said.  I said we aren't embarrassed.  We would def trade it all for 1 win.  No doubt there.  But it isn't embarrassing.  Disheartening for sure.
>You might be the most in denial poster I've come across recently.  Everything I said was factually correct.  >Traded a second for Corey Dillon, four picks in the first two rounds at running back is a lot  Four picks in 22 years is not a lot at all.  >He's also has gone out and signed running backs and prioritized re-signing guys.  Like who? Which backs has he not only re-signed but paid above market value for?  >How many times have Pats picked in the top 20 last 23 years? 4? C'mon man  Doesn't change what I said.
Bruh just admit you were wrong and take the L

the hardest part about eating healthy is that you can blow it all in one meal, which takes like 10 minutes to eat. 23 hours and 50 minutes of responsible eating and restraint isn't good enough. like, usually I imagine someone who is overweight as eating poorly all day long, but when I'm trying to lose weight, I find it goes more like:  Breakfast: oatmeal with blue berries, banana on the side. 400 calories  Lunch: Greek salad, 500 calories  Wow I'm doing great! I'm easily on pace to hit only 1700 calories today  Dinner: Fried chicken sliders and chili cheese fries, 1600 calories  Damn, so close!

Today in our quarter wrap-up retro, my scrum master asked "where is your 'battery charged' percentage after this quarter?" My two team mates answered about 70-80% charged, and I said about 10% charged.

They aren't even allowed to say my name in the presence of their boss (who was my ex-boss); he got tired of hearing "key_lime_pie did that" whenever he asks who is responsible for a task.  He never once asked me what I did or what any of my employees did; all he did was bark orders, which is all he does now, only he doesn't have someone who can translate Idiot into English for him anymore, and he doesn't have anyone with the experience to do the stuff he needs done.

It’s just me and 2 other coworkers here. No management or anything, we are all the same title/role. Never been so tempted to go out for some beers during lunch hour lol.
I didn't realize Boston Scott was so good at Rocket League. That's pretty cool
I say I love long drives but holy shit does the last 30 so minutes till you get back home on the drive back take forever.
Just your regular reminder to please be civil at all times in these threads.  No matter how... out there... some people's posts are.
The top post on /r/unpopularopinion is some peak niceguys shit lol
Had a short Friday at work. Only could work 3 hours and then left to get some Dunkin for breakfast. Playing Rainbow Six to relax. Happy Easter y'all
Listening to ambient BOTW sounds while I work in my silly little spreadsheets this morning.  Very excited for next month and Tears of the Kingdom.  Kinda wanna play something in the meantime though. Looking at Chrono Cross, never played that but I love Trigger.
After further review, it would appear that the compressor in my fridge is dead. And apparently it's not really something worth fixing instead of buying a new fridge.   Yay...
Downloaded MLB 23 for Xbox 1 and its a complete joke of a game.  Load times are HORRENDOUS and the frames are between 15-20 most of the time. Also I struck a dude out swinging but the Ump decided to call it a ball. Input lag out the ass as well so pitching was a real chore.
Sure AI is a thing and it's impressive, but the mass produced ones we all have access to are still shit and haven't progressed in a decade.   Alexa, Siri, Cortana (is that still a thing?), Bixbi, And Ok Google.....they all sucks.
People who take bites out of string cheese should be jailed.
Me as a Jets fan in 2019 treating myself to a few jerseys. “I’m gonna get Adams and Darnold. It’s a no brainer. They’re going to be cornerstone players for years to come.”   I’ve since stuck to my Chrebet jersey. Sauce will be a safe play soon though.
The show Beef on Netflix with Steven Yeun is so good.
It's not as good as  Terminator 1  or 2, but T3 is really enjoyable.
What are other teams opinion on the Pat McAfee show?  As a Lions fan, I don’t really like him because he came off pompous when talking about our team.
Imma bit torn on the legal merits of the charges facing Trump. But the fact that nobody running for President against him will let loose and attack him for illegally concealing hush money payments to hide his sleazy affair with a porn star from voters is all the proof you need that none of these chucklefucks running for the nomination can beat him. Trump is going to easily waltz his way to it because none of these cowards are willing to take him on.
Why is it that the NPCs that spawn at my gym never spawn at any other locations
I've got a week off work, my wife is pregnant, and my time of doing what I want when I want is nearing an end.  So, I ask you, the people of r/nfl, what should I do with my time over the next 10 days?
Gonna go against the grain here but man is there a sporting event more far up its own ass than the Masters? Make it so nobody can afford to go, kick people out for cheering. Like if you're going to force people to spend a long weekend in Augusta at least make it fun.
I love how one of the highlights of the most exclusive sporting event is eating $1.50 cheese sandwiches. The Masters is so weird and cool
I'm probably more southerner than Kid Rock will ever be and I've never spoken with an accent or [fired a weapon like an idiot.] (https://twitter.com/KidRock/status/1643090302410936323) This dude is such a wannabe southerner for a guy that grew up in Detroit fucking Michigan.
In true Kansas City fashion my in laws will be serving ribs for Easter

Sam Bennett has such a cool story. Would be awesome to see him win the whole thing.
Got invited to a birthday of a girl ive never talked to in my life lmao  Well friends are going so i won’t be too mad lol
Starting to feel like even taking an hour or two off work actually feels better than a taking a whole day off just for me time.  When I have a whole day off, I often wind up sleeping in too late, so I already feel like I wasted a chunk of my time off. Then my indecision about how to spend my time winds up spoiling the satisfaction I get out of anything.  Past couple days I've taken an hour off in the morning and an hour off in the afternoon, technically because I have a cold, but also because I could use some me time. That way I still have to get up at a reasonable time, but a bit later, so I still feel more rested than usual. Then I have a bit of me time in the afternoon, but not so much that I'm sorting through a dozen different options for how to spend my time.  Today I just have the one game I've been focusing on right now, so that's what I'm going to play once I get off in 15 minutes until it's time to pick up the kiddo.
I’m supposed to be at the gym.  Instead I’m running a fever and wrapped up in all the blankets.   Hopefully it passes soon and I can lift tomorrow
Do I buy an extra TV for the Masters and return it next week?   Yes or yes?
The right wing rage machine is in full force after the last week.   It’s kind of insane the outright lies that gets passed off as facts in right wing circles; The Tennessee lawmakers got expelled because it was just like Jan. 6th, Trump is only under indictment because democrats are afraid to run against him, Clarence Thomas didn’t accept bribes because he was “friends” with the GOP mega donor, etc etc etc.   This is just things I’ve read on this site (which is *very* lite compared to most right wing social media). It’s not confined to the right wing “news” subs either, I’ve seen the same things posted on this sub, in this thread.   How the hell can we have a functioning country when half of the people believe in fairy tales?
I am so sick of hearing about Angel Reese and her attempt to, for whatever reason, feud with the First Lady over a harmless attempt at being kind to the losing team. Why has this nonsense been headlines on CNN for the past four days? We truly do live in the stupidest timeline.
I shared this last night, and it's so damn funny, I had to share it on the new post.   Here's the two reactions I got from my cats when I gave them catnip:  Chill   https://imgur.com/YHNu855.jpg  Fiend   https://imgur.com/NHTKtWj.jpg   Not only was that cat fiending, I had to kick him out for attacking the other cats if they got near his catnip pile. I left a window open & he quickly made his way back in
I love that The Master’s app has natural sound instead of commentary for a choice. It’s like ASMR but better
Ravioli Ravioli Give Me The Formuoli
What's everyone listening to?
New kid at work had to get trained on the program which only runs on XP.   Kid had no idea how to run it. I show him the basics but it shouldn't be this hard. Besides Windows 8, it's all been the same general thing.   We chatted a bit about older tech. It blew his mind that the enter key used to be the return key and there were two of them.
Dragon Age Origin Companion Tier List:      Dog: Dog   S: Alistar, Morrigan, Leliana   A: Wynne   B: Zevran, Shale, Loghain   C: Oghren   D: Sten
Question: is there any rule regarding trading a player after you’ve signed them? For example, if the Broncos wanted to trade Jared Stidham after just signing him, could they?
Decided to try and eat really clean through April and get my bikini body in shape. That means no booze except for cheat day, which is Saturday. Getting through a stat holiday and basically back to back Friday nights without a beer is quite a challenge.
I really need to make the time to watch the newest Jack Ryan season
Last night my daughter was with her mom so I did a pickup order at Walmart for all her Easter stuff. But the minimum order is 35 for pickup and an Easter basket, a dozen eggs, and dye wasn’t very expensive…so now I have waaaayyyy too many Reese’s Easter cups lol. Talk about a first world problem tho.
The best coworker I have is the guy in charge of the pizza station at the cafe. Big smile on his face, serves you a slice with a laugh, super friendly and personable. Great change of pace from all the engineers and programmers I gotta talk to all day.
So being Jewish, I didn't know about Black Friday.  I was just at the office for almost four hours with nobody else there and just learned why.
Got about halfway through The Martian today. Man, what an absolutely fantastic book! I'm tempted to just power through and knock it out tonight, I can't get enough of it.  Been sitting on my shelf for a couple of years now. I regret not reading it sooner!
You know what, In n Out fries aren't even that bad.
It took until college to get over my fear of wearing sweatpants in public. I noticed that all of the kids that peed their pants in elementary school had this same fashion choice in common, and I didn't want to be guilty by association.
For the guitar people out there: I bought a used Tonewood Amp off of Facebook marketplace. It's basically a mini amp that attached to the back of your guitar, and uses the reverberations from the guitar to produce cool sound effects with no amp required. I'm really enjoying it. Cool piece of technology.
I bought some athletic shorts with built in compression shorts and they are a game changer. Easily the most comfortable athletic shorts I own
No thoughts, head empty, Miami Boys Choir music
So my new years resolution was to journal my day, and write my goals for the next day down its been so fucking good for my organizational skills and emotions
New Path of Exile league launch today.  Not going to lie, I plan on playing it like a massive degenerate this weekend.
Been at my job going on 6 months and I have to say I'd be dead in the water if I didn't use OneNote to organize the myriad amount of projects I have. Hate that they are dropping support for it as I love that I can just embed PDFs, spread sheets, docs, and images.
Do employers usually give Monday after Easter off?
I'm convinced that the Star Wars fans who say "Legends was better than Canon" have never read a single Legends novel. Yeah Legends had some great stuff that people talk about to this day, but then there's the other 70% that no one ever talks about that was complete dogshit
I don’t drink much pop but today I was needing a little boost and got a fountain Coke with a couple shots of cherry syrup in it and oh my god that’s good

Just filled out midyear evaluation and I think I've already accomplished all the 2023 goals that I listed (our fiscal year starts October 1). Now to see if I can get every category to "outstanding" or whatever it is and get a bigger raise than last year (6%).
Yo is it normal to go through a panel interview for help desk job?
Meth heads keep buying chickens & ducks from us, and while they may take care of em, it weirds me out, cause meth heads get up to some sick shit
Its 9 PM and im motivated af and so fucking happy for no reason. Guess ill be up until the sun comes up…
Went to the store to window shop Gunpla yesterday hoping not to find anything I want but then I saw they finally had new stock of the [HG Gundam Aerial](https://www.hlj.com/productimages/ban/bans63030_7.jpg). I've been wanting to get my hands on one without paying jacked up prices for months. Super excited as the second part of The Witch from Mercury starts up on Sunday.
[Watch the Mario movie with this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4qRp4OfUn8&t=236s)
The Mario movie is doing insane numbers, way above expectations. Looks likely that this leads to a lot more video game adaptations from big IPs in the future. Might be entering a new era for blockbusters.
Happy Good Friday to those that celebrate.
"You got my \[insert info here\] wrong."  "I literally just used the application you submitted online."  \*Stares  \*Stares
This is the worst Friday because it's the first Friday where it's 70 degrees outside and you're stuck inside the office.
This morning I got some sample tasks to do in advance of my next interview on Tuesday. Gonna be a busy weekend.   Also I’d like to bring a cooked vegetable to an Easter potluck. I doubt I'll have access to the oven to reheat. Any suggestions for something that serves at room temp or chilled?
Are we seeing a Lamar holdout today?????
This might not be true anymore, but as of a few years ago, the only country in the world where Starbucks opened locations and did not succeed was Israel  I knew a guy from Israel and he said it's because they already had a similar but cheaper chain
Trust tree time : tho my playlist I listen to while getting rad is wu-tang heavy I have a chris issac song on there.
Randomly dipped from 85 degrees Tuesday to 50 degrees yesterday and today. What gives. I thought this winter menace was rid of.
The James Mangold Star Wars movie looks interesting      Watch the SW Fans rip it to shreds for trying something a little different
It still has moments where I really enjoy it but so much of Mandalorian S3 feels pointless and silly. Worse than an early Trek reset they have things happen in the plot and then undo them less than a season later.
The lemon Kit Kats aren’t too bad
Final bday present from my GF is tickets to the Between the Buried and Me: Parallax II show.  playing the whole thing front to back.  hope they play Parallax I. It's short I'm sure they can fit it in! Only time I ever heard them play those songs live is when the EP first came out.
Daily reminder that Joey Wheeler was robbed in the Battle City finals
Breaking my observance of Orthodox Lent to celebrate Catholic Easter with my family. This whole experience has affirmed just how little I want to go plant based full time. Can't wait for that ham and cheesy potatoes.
Tried changing it up and sketching a [car](https://imgur.com/a/khAm6dD) today   I kinda like the middle and back but I think the perspective on the hood/front is kinda fucked and makes it look a little funny
ace ventura is overrated as hell  its just jim carrey walking funny and yelling nonsense.
During this dead time - our sub now has two posts per day suggesting we should draft JSN at 10. We have two (imo) top 25 wide receivers and a top 5 tight end locked up through 2025 and have lost valuable starters and depth on the defensive side and offensive line.   Anyone else have any painfully dumb draft takes circulating in their subs?
Both of my parents have the zodiac sign Virgo, and it took me quite a few years to realize the hilarious irony of that
Road cycling rules because it's one of the few sports where you have both the elements of a team sport (5-8 riders working towards a common goal) and the elements of a racing competition, with many teams (18-22+) out on track at once all influencing the race.  It introduces some gamesmanship that gets lost on head to head or individual competitions   Anyway this Sunday is probably the biggest of the single day races, Paris-Roubaix, and I highly recommend you check it out if you have some spare time in the morning

If Zeke goes to a team I marginally like, I will buy a Zeke jersey. He's a good dude.
Earned myself some brownie points with the girlfriend. Went home for lunch, and made a bucket of hummus. She's going to be so excited when she sees it in the fridge.
Wasn't able to finish my plate of brisket and sides yesterday but the good thing is yesterday's dinner is now today's lunch.
My old ass is going to the Unknown Mortal Orchestra concert but the opener doesn't even start till 9 pm. Good god that's gonna be late. Like I said...old.
The New Star Wars content makes me pretty excited. Ahsoka should be good.
The Succession episode S1E6 hit me in the feels. I mean we all know what is probably going to happen, but the way it happened was stunning. Still in a state of shock over it.   Loving this show so far.
r/nfl minecraft server when?
Today is a day.
Made jackfruit al pastor crunchwraps with cilantro lime rice last night for my jackfruit hesitant girlfriend. I get way too carried away in the kitchen making dinner during weeknights. It's getting a little out of hand...

I'm normally pretty calm about my Pixel phone but POS is making 30MB images of videos now in order to "find the right picture to use". Yeah, every other picture is 4 MB or so and then wow, a 30 MB PICTURE? Something ain't right.
Vince McMahon ain’t the greatest of human, what billionaire is?  His stranglehold on internet wrestling fans is a case study of how you shouldn’t have a fandom as your identity.

Might be time to get a new phone. The iPhone 12 I got a couple years back keeps crashing on me. Anyone else been experiencing this?
I really loved AIR, watched it last night and thought Affleck did a great job building tension to something we knew was going to happen but in an organic way. Great ensemble cast where I didn't feel there was a  "weak-link" and Chris Messina who plays David Falk was hilarious.
My mom's gmail labels, both on the android app and desktop, are missing emails she previously sorted. The app and desktop version are showing the same things, but emails that once were in the label are no longer there. thoughts on possible explanations?  closest thing I see after searching is a sync error, but I don't think that will solve it. You get 15gb - my other idea is that she is close to that limit and gmail is selecting emails to delete

Damn y'all see Jeopardy? Crazy shit. Awesome.
Someone tweeted that him announcing he cheated was the most correct thing he's ever reported and I felt bad for laughing
I cannot stand Allbright so this makes me laugh pretty hard.   [For those who can’t find it since he deleted it](https://twitter.com/respectmycos/status/1644211259603312645?s=46&t=NdaK9Nu0zKzOeX50PjDg7A)
I can’t stand the dude at all, but I think the dude has trouble with the drink. He posts a lot photos of random cocktails at bars and his photos of himself at random outings he always looks absolutely terrible. Maybe this is me making things up, but his tweets are sometimes….odd like this
I’m barely familiar with dude but airing this out in public is not the way to fix it
Did you remember to pack your anal beads?
Nice town. Lots of tea places there if you like crumpets.
Beat those dirty brits
Eat more protein for breakfast and lunch, will help you feel more full so you don't blow up on dinner. I have the same issue.
Me seeing a box of cheezits in the cupboard "I'll just have a handful"  500 calories later "damn why did I do that"
1700 calories in a day what the fuck
Thats why you don't have something that heavy for dinner. Although I continue to eat under 2000 per day and still notice no loss even with exercise...
Dude told the world he was having boner troubles and sexted his ex. Absolutely wilding
There’s still time.
Social media is a double edged sword. It allowed us to fix ugly sonic, but also made all of our worst moments public.   Truly a monkey paw moment.
I think about chocolate rabbits.
I'm way too far from my Catholic school days because this post made me go "fuck, did I somehow forget today is Easter? Did I somehow forget today is *Sunday?*" And then I remembered the whole thing about Good Friday being a thing and the whole thing not just being one day.
I'm Jewish so I've been spending the day jokingly apologizing to all of  my coworkers.
Seeing Jesus as a target of the political, economical, and religious institutions of the day and how those themes are still very relevant 2000 years later? That’s good deconstruction
What he say
Dude's a fucking clown. He's notorious in Denver for being wrong about everything.
It's wild because there's an element of fan engagement to being a beat writer nowadays for most folks out there. You have a twitter account, it's where you post links to your articles, and you do a bit of fan engagement. It's a little bit personal because it has your name attached to it... but it really is a professional account.  You know what you shouldn't do on a professional Twitter account? Whatever the fuck Ben Allbright did.
so that's who ben allbright was, i thought he was one of them poilitlcal pundits who argues with college kids like ben shapiro and jordan peterson
reading that thread is why I sometimes find social media so strange. that is something people in the past would've kept in house.
It’s pretty much the biggest tournament of the year this weekend, so casual fans are interested
As soon as all of my peers hit their 30s and bought a home, they all got into golf. I think it's a combination of the popularity of places like Top Golf and the fact that it's a less intense sport where you get to spend the day outside.
Remember: golf spelled backwards is flog.  Makes ya think...
I've always been a big fan but I think any sport with a Netflix documentary gets a boost
Golf is the ultimate rich white guy sport. I grew up an upper middle class white boy so we didn't golf.
What happened?  Hahaha nvm I found it. Dudes brain broke.
If he hasn't lost his late night radio show on a second tier station already, they won't fire him for this. He's always been an idiot on Twitter  Hopefully he loses his weird culty fanbase on Twitter though
You know it's bad when even the conservative sub is saying things like, "This is fucked up and he should be impeached. Because that's what we'd be calling for if this had been a liberal justice."
I know bijan robinson, JSN, and stetson bonnett.
Rebels is definitely a more even beginning-to-end serialized story. Clone Wars is often more of an episodic monster-of-the-week/random-excursion-of-the-week series. There's probably a "just the essentials" viewing guide out there for those who want a straight shot through the essential arcs of Clone Wars. I just used the official chronological order when I watched it for the first time myself a couple years ago.  One thing Rebels should get more credit for is conceiving of a compelling cast of original characters and unique locales, whereas obviously Clone Wars is more often building off the existing prequel era characters and settings. Really excited to see more Rebels folded into the live action shows.
It's a close contest for me. Clone Wars had higher highs but lower lows while I found Rebels to be pretty consistent quality all the way through.  The trailer for Ahsoka looks really good.
A lot of stuff that seemed amazing in grade school just seems cool because it’s something you’ve never seen before. Like those big ass tarps the whole class would hold… what the hell is the purpose of that 😂
In elementary school after school daycare we had a game where they taped a colored piece of paper to your back and another kid’s back and then everyone watched you two while you tried to see what color the other kids paper was without giving yours up. I thought it was fun as hell, but looking back I realize somebody was like let’s do a gladiator sport for kids lol
Hundreds lol
Nine games. Thanks, Steam sales.
Games that I've bought, but never finished?  Toooooo many  Games that I want to pick up right now?  Basically none
I have a bunch of free/cheaply bought games, including the Uncharted series, Horizon Zero Dawn, Evil Dead, and a few others. I got pretty far in Uncharted 1, but the controls are so bad, I quit & haven't checked out the rest
Growing larger and larger ever since I started working a steady job again.
Several on PS5. Several on PC which I don't have time to get around to. Number about 7
Too many to count.  I started playing Classic WoW when it came out in 2019 "just for a quick fun nostalgia trip" and 4 years/3 expansions later I'm still here while my switch/other pc games weep.  I'm done after WotLK though. This needs to end lol.
It's endless.
I could go on forever, but the ones at the top of my backlog are: Half-Life Alyx, Back 4 Blood, Halo, Banjo-Tooie, and Teardown.
I deleted my steam wishlist long.
My backlog right now is:  * Halo 6  * Hogwarts Legacy  and I think that's about it currently.
Last I looked, about 50 games. Many come bundles and I have been making some progress of trying those out. But I am at the point where I don't have so much regret and pick up more games at the next sale.
It’s like naming your kid Jeeves. They are gonna end up being a butler.
The head IT guy at my undergrad university had the last name "Hacker"
and she just texted me, thanks buddy i got you next time....and she misspelled my name ha
I'm always struck by how many generic ass cooking channels there are. I have a few that I follow, but mainly because they're more personality-driven and have a unique style. But there are so many that come up in my FYP that use the exact same editing, exact same speaking style, and always open their views the same way with some generic, "I can't believe how easy this blahblahblah recipe was" statement. I know they're just playing to an algorithm, I just can't believe how many people I see doing the exact same thing. How do they not cannibalize each other's views? Or do most of them just work at content farms?
It’s jarring that the owner of Twitter has suspended some journalists from Twitter for being critical of him, even though he claims to be a free speech absolutist.
Get it, my dude
How do they compare to AJ Dillon?
Question: what exactly does an SM do?  I've looked into it since my last two positions have been PM focused and it looks interesting. I'm not in IT but have some dev experience and some of my projects do involve the IT team (although I'm more of a liaison to other teams in those, not managing an IT/dev team).  From my understanding it's like a PM but more hands off in the sense that you're more of a shield between the dev team and all the other noise and are there to make sure they can get thru their sprints with minimal distraction?  If you can't tell I don't have any formal agile experience lol
I imagined them really saying "key lime pie did that" and made me laugh hard.  Way to go!
it is really fascinating that the higher up the chain you go, the more you get to people who just go "you do this thing, figure it out" and they have no actual understanding of how the sausage gets made. Bill Burr had a joke that Steve Jobs wasn't that big of a deal because all he did was go "I want all my songs in this rectangle" and then a team of engineers figured out all the actual math and engineering. Like "haha that's funny... but also yes I feel like that's true."  Middle management gets shit on a lot but I feel like they are actually extremely valuable. They're the people who are actually able to translate "big picture ideas" into workable plans on a quarter-by-quarter/week-by-week basis. They may not have the technical ability that their employees have, but those employees wouldn't have any direction without someone translating between the top-level and the actual workers.   Good luck to you, man! Hopefully the next place you land won't be as idiotic, but it does seem like there's always some of that going around.
Taco bell no doubt
Get some chili fuck it

Go to the original Chipotle  Chipotle started in Denver
Woke up early to go to the gym today and was swimming in warm humidity. I hope winter is finally over.
I want to see some iteration of the Yuuzhan Vong war. Even if it’s not exactly like the comics. That sounds like a much cooler villain than just the Empire rehashed again.
have to find a happy medium with your program and goals...dont quit though finish out the 6-8 weeks!
> It’s just me and 2 other coworkers here. No management or anything, we are all the same title/role. Never been so tempted to go out for some beers during lunch hour lol.  About 10 years ago, I worked at a job where my boss flew in Monday through Wednesday and was remote Thursday and Friday. Once my two team members and I discovered the $1.99 happy hour Sapporos at a nearby Japanese joint, Friday afternoons basically became a bitch session over beers as soon as we were done with the Friday 12:30PM video check in we know he scheduled at that time just to be a dick.
In vet school we would sometimes have “fluid rounds”. Pretty much if the rotation was slow we’d go out to a bar.
I miss burger mondays. we used to do that around 2015. whole bunch of colleagues just went out for an hour and drank beer and ate burgers. then it ended.
It's when you get super close and hit traffic. Brutal.
on a cross-country road trip, the last hour of the return trip takes easily 6 hours
Yesterday some guy said all beers are the same. Today, I saw a person in this very thread who doesn’t like Peeps. How am I supposed to handle these types of comments? There’s a limit to what deserves civility. C’mon, even you have to agree.
Sadly this thread does attract some wackos so the best course of action is just to report and move on if I see anything out of the ordinary. We are all pals here, and I think people have forgotten that.
"The sad reality is that confidence will get you much further than intelligence."  Yeesh. What these guys don't seem to get is: Everyone has to learn how to be confident in the world. It's not always easy, You're not special, you didn't get fucked.   Kids who have coasted through school on their raw intelligence think it's so tragically unfair that just being smart with zero extra effort doesn't get them everything handed to them on a platter. The real world is always a wake-up call for these guys.
> The sad reality is that confidence will get you much further in life than intelligence  The perfect statement to people who feel like they're smart regardless of the reality, want to blame their problems on a 'lack of confidence,' and look down on those who are successful, pretending that success is inevitably undeserved.
I love Chrono Cross.   But just don't go into it thinking you're going to be playing Chrono Trigger 2. It's quite different but really good, IMO, in its own ways.
Link to the Playlist plz.
Makes sense, tbh. The compressor is like 90% of the fridge. The rest of it is just an insulated box.
Gotta get a fridge you can use reddit on
Lots of manufacturers have 10 year warranties on compressors, so call the number on the fridge if that applies to you. The bigger problem I had was finding an appliance repair company that both worked with the manufacturer and wasn't full of total scum. Literally no such company exists in my area, so I just bought a new fridge.
nah. it's a great game. Old console? It's been 4 years, games are optimizing for the new ones now.
I believe for the ump call, that was intention. If it is like previous iterations, there should be sliders for that as well as 100 other settings. Don't know if there is calibration for input lag though.  Edit: Just reread that and you specified it was a swiniging strike. Now maybe that is just advanced ump accuracy, but more likely a bug.
Should add I own two of the older games and in both of them they had a dumb errror that if it was raining in one game, it would rain for the whole series. Not a big deal, but the fact that it lasted multiple generations says a lot (I believe they fixed it in a more recent generation). Just funny that it is a bug that can be easily fixed in terms of setting a flag.
I actually disagree with the premise that AI is a "thing."   The technologies we've been calling AI are lots of _different_ things, none of which are as intelligent as [Clever Hans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clever_Hans).
But the voice generating AI are pretty damn impressive. Think of all the memes...
This is how I feel about movie theater employees who don't layer the butter when dishing out popcorn.
Hope he doesn't use too small a slice for his sloppy mudpie
That's the first one to come out while I was alive. Saw it in theaters with my dad as a kid. Don't they straight up go to NORAD in that one, or at least a fictionalized version of it? I thought that was pretty cool since that Colorado Springs theater we saw it at was like 15 minutes away from actual NORAD.
I don't particularly care for the guy so whenever I see something about him on social media I can't help but roll my eyes.
Overgrown frat boy with mediocre to below average intelligence
I can't stand him. Nothing to do with my fandom.
Honestly I just get bored watching his show. I just personally don't find him or his crew very compelling podcast/radio/whatever they are personalities   Also because all the news/rumors broken on his show immediately get picked up and posted everywhere watching his show feels kinda pointless to me because I already know all his noteworthy content
I listened for a bit just as background noise. They didnt take themselves too serious. Then they started taking themselves pretty serious and it just wasnt for me anymore.
I think he's an entertaining guy and a real asset to any sports adjacent production he's involved in where he has a strong producer that can rein him in and keep him on focus. His show is decidedly not that -- surrounding him with buddies on his payroll means the show can take on whatever tone he wants, and increasingly often that tone is anti-intellectual and petty in a very self-serving way. Comes off as a bully.
It's pretty solid and honest. It doesn't sugar coat anything like most media
Biden v Trump Round 2: Electric Boogaloo  Except this time Trump is gonna get hit with the “at least I’m not a fraudulent criminal lol” from Biden at every opportunity. Important not to get complacent and get out the vote though.
I see it more as Trumps base doesn't give a shit about any of this and if a Republican comes out swinging against him they'll be seen as cooperating in the liberal "witch hunt" so it behooves them to just ignore it.
It's insanely disappointing. Even avoid attacking him for the legality. Just go after "hey you've lost and also I never paid a porn star hush money because I'm in a faithful relationship with my wife remember when we cared about that stuff?".    But they won't. They aren't attacking him on _anything_. They seem to think they'll somehow be able to constantly defend and praise or ignore him but get elected over him somehow. It's just staggering. They want to be president but they're actively afraid.
what's really amazing to me is how seemingly EASY it would be for any republican to sweep independents by dropping the culture war bullshit and just going back to tax cuts, tax cuts, and permanent tax cuts (not this sunsetting bullshit they tried last time)  the people who supposedly care about 3 trans athletes? Rs won't lose their vote anyway.   maybe it's too late with the abortion flip.
Most gym goers are geofenced to that location in my experience
In Houston they spawn in 60k SUVs they can't see out of. It's madness.
Sit on the couch playing video games for 18 hours a day while eating junk food.
Enjoy using the bathroom in peace. Once that little human comes out, you'll never have a moment alone in the bathroom.  The biggest adjustment for me with having a kid, is the absolute loss of your free time. Being a parent, at least for the first few years, isn't that hard. It's more about making sure that the little human doesn't commit suicide. They just don't have any sense of *danger* about anything.
Hah. The comment before this is raving about the Masters.
I went in college as a poor undergrad. It was like a 500 dollar weekend. Expensive, but not outrageous. The tickets and food were way less than an NFL game. Hotel and gas to get there was the large majority of the budget.   Cheering is a bit misleading. Clapping and saying something after a good hit is fine. Nobody cared. It was those who yelled at top of their lungs that got kicked out. As they should. Just because the guy you are watching hit doesn't mean the guy on the hole behind you isn't in his back swing.   Not all fun is high octane.   Not seeing up its ass in any of this.
I don't really watch golf but I do love the idea they enforce their own culture and their own norms  I've gotten into it with people about similar stuff in hockey about waiting for stoppages in play before leaving/returning to their seats  Really not important at the end of the day, but if you don't like it you don't have to participate
> Gonna go against the grain here but man is there a sporting event more far up its own ass than the Masters?   Wimbledon, maybe? The Monaco Grand Prix?
Hah. The comment after this is ranting about the Masters.
There are also plenty of pictures of him partying with gay celebrities and drag queens when he was popular.   Kid Rock doesn’t give a shit about LGBT people. They don’t offend him. He’s just pretending they do because his time is a pop star is over and he knows his market now is with reactionary weirdos.
He grew up a rich privileged upperclass Northern kid who started cosplaying in his teens as a salt of the Earth redneck. [This is his childhood home.](https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/macomb/2016/11/04/kid-rock-macomb-county-house/93299716/)   > The four-bedroom, four-bath, neo-Georgian colonial house is steps away from a private stable with two horse stalls and a tack room, a tennis court, and the estate sports the name “Apple Crest Farm,” Milstein said.     "Grits Sandwiches for Breakfast," my ass.
Being a southerner wannabe is a major identity category for rednecks from Michigan to be fair  To be less fair, Kid Rock may be the biggest panderer of his generation
I'm definitely more southerner than him, and have spoken with an accent while firing a weapon like an idiot.  That being said, fuck this guy. Southern hospitality requires extending courtesy, compassion, and the social graces to any and all people, regardless of color, creed, or gender. The only exception is if they're being selfish asswaffles, like him.
Is she hot?
I love the occasional days where I start two hours late and can get a leisurely morning in at the gym or end two hours early (and my wife is cooking dinner) so I can get a couple hours of uninterrupted gaming in.  If I'm taking staycation days I'm like you, I need a structured activity or set of tasks to complete otherwise I won't do shit except move at a glacial pace.  What game you playing?
You can't sit at work all day so sometimes I intersperse some time off to lie down next door or use the twitch computers but I always try to come back before the workstation auto locks
Get well soon friend!
If you can afford it keep it and use it on football Sundays, having one TV going with your game of choice and the other with RedZone is a truly life changing way to watch on Sundays
> The Tennessee lawmakers got expelled because it was just like Jan. 6th  Saying this out of one side of your mouth while also saying that the Jan. 6th events were nothing more than people calmly touring the halls of the Capitol.
I’m sure one of our local apologists will be right along to explain to you how you’re obviously overreacting and that none of this is a big deal.
> The right wing rage machine is in full force after the last week. >  >   Probably helps that they ate a lot of fat fucking Ls
Yea, this is kind of cringeworthy at this point. I had no problem with her taunting Clark or any of that and I do enjoy watching her play but this is where she loses me. She's complaining about how Jill's idea of inviting Iowa violates the idea that Jill is supposed to have all of their backs as women despite the fact that LSU declined to have Jill into their locker room prior to the game because Joe's bracket didn't have them getting to the Final Four. So, apparently, Angel's idea of supporting other women also includes holding them responsible for the decisions of the men in their lives? Weird flex but ok.  I thought Jill's idea was dumb but people are getting entirely too worked up over it and reading entirely too much into it.
it seriously is ancient news at this point. it happened a week ago. at first it was good for the women's game to have that kind of rivalry but when the media keeps talking about it and won't let the story move on it may hinder women's basketball  reese for her part does play a brilliant heel, she's been doing that since her days growing up in Baltimore
We don't like participation trophies as a culture even if you're someone who is deeply part of the establishment
Dang he looks ready to throw paws
No lie the calmness of how the sport is covered is my favorite part of watching it
Spicy meatball!
I've been staying with my mother for a few days. Every day, she listens to the same radio station that plays the same songs multiple times every day.   So I'm listening to Kokomo by the Beach Boys around 5 times a day, against my will.
*Florence + the Machine* thanks to some guy in here last week who recommended it.
The new boygenius album, didn’t get around to listening to it on release.
Gorillaz - Cracker Island. I'm obsessed with it after watching a video essay on Plastic Island right before it came out.  Mix that in with random garbage Youtube adds because I listened to it before. Like "I Believe In A Thing Called Love" by The Darkness.  I also have a [716 song playlist of Space Jam mashups](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuaeheJGTPc_uCpwF0_p3qZy_XB4DQhK3) queued up to listen to while I play Path of Exile. Because someone described my build as "Playing basketball" and I hate myself.
I’ve been going back to my high school/early college days and been on a Black Keys bender lately.
Discovering 80s music lately. Right now I'm listening to Scorpions Love at First Sting
I've got tickets to take my niece to see Taylor Swift at the end of July so I'm perpetually in pregame mode right now.
Taylor Swift. I’m always listening to Taylor Swift.
Its warming up here in Southern California so I'm back on my Slightly Stoopid, Sublime, Long Beach Dub Allstars, Stick Figure etc mixes.   Spent the winter on Every time I Die revisits.... damn that band was so good.
As soon as it starts warming up I go on a Clutch kick.
Right now I'm listing to Higher by Sleep Token
Any player can be traded within the valid trade window at any time for any reason unless they have something written into their contract preventing it.
I finally got back to bikini body (under 125 pounds), but all it takes is a big dinner and I'm back over and have a prominent gut.
Just hope it isn't as bad as 2
> waaaayyyy too many Reese’s Easter cups   No such thing, friend.
Bruh, the other day I was trying to order a pizza for delivery and I had a coupon for a 1-topping large plus breadsticks for $14.99 and it said the minimum order was $15. It dead-ass would not let me order it with a $14.99 order sitting there lmao
~~Black~~ Good Friday lol
People are dunking on you but Black Friday is an alternate name for it, though not common anymore and has been co-opted by another day of the year dedicated to shopping. Certain denominations still do the Black Fast on Good Friday.
Black friday lmfao
Black Friday is the one after Thanksgiving.
It's so good. Movie is solid too (Not quite as good as the book though in my opinion).
It's good as is the film
People complain that their fries are too potatoey. Is that supposed to be bad? That's what they are.
They taste like my grandma’s fresh french fries, so it’s a different kind of nostalgia. Just potatoes and old fryer oil.
Nah, they're kind of bad.  Most restaurants use frozen fries that have already been fried once at a lower temperature in a factory to cook them through. Then restaurants fry them a second time at a higher temperature to crisp them up on the outside.  In-N-Out cuts their fries in house, but fry them once. That's why they come out drier with an almost leathery exterior.  That said, they're still a salty, potato-y treat, so they're alright, especially if you get them animal style. But they objectively use a cooking method that produces a less crispy French fry, which seems to be most people's preference and why In-N-Out's fries get so much flack.
They never were bad
TIL I like wearing sweats cause I peed my pants.
I still don’t like wearing sweats in public. Feel that it makes me look like a slob.
I haven't gotten it off since public school
Usually it's Good Friday if they're exceptionally old school, but generally nothing for Easter.
It's a public holiday in France.
In the UK, yes
no
Especially now since there are some bomb ass novels that are canon  The new thrawn trilogy is sick
70% sounds about right. What really got me were the series that alternated among a few different writers, like the Caedus novels. I got whiplash from the quality difference.
Cherry Coke is amazing
I used to love getting flavored Coke or Dr. Pepper from Sonic. Probably one of my worst college habits, of which I had many. Always got their massive Route 44 size too. Terrible.
Good for him. Movement should help his recovery.
Depends on the org. Big corporates have become hideous in recent times for stupidly bloated interview processes for roles that really don't need them.
I mean, if you can't trust a meth head with chickens and ducks, who can you trust?
Yeah meth will have them choking their chicken all night lol
You know what they say, all toasters toast toast.
I feel like a good Pokemon movie and a good Zelda movie could both put up crazy numbers.
my son saw it today, he said it was entertaining  (he generally has no patience for bad movies).
Smash Bros Cinematic Universe incoming
the reviews were so mid at the beginning it's nice to see the movie rebound
Thank you!
As much as I like Jack Black, Lizzo, and Christopher Lloyd, I couldn't stand the latest episode. Why the hell did we need a Mando buddy cop story where they literally just pieced together every cliche and trope imaniginable and slapped a star wars coat of paint on top? And having a bar for droids doesn't make any sense at all. There was only one scene in the episode that even mattered to the plot, and it was also a series of cliches.
Looking good! Cars are really hard to draw, especially from weird angles. I even like cars, but still hate drawing them, lol. Also, I don’t think it’s so much the perspective as it is that the line of the car itself is not straight. So it’s less that the perspective warps, and more that you drew a car under a pretty consistent perspective but its body shape curves slightly, if that makes any sense. You can avoid that by lightly sketching a straight line skeleton following perspective lines when you first start, then building on top of it (but freehanding can also result in sometimes delightful results).
oooh do adam sandler next
What team?
I've never seen an offensive linemen score a touchdown kind of a worthless position
I do think you guys need another WR with a top 50 or so pick probably.  Our team has converged onto the two main guys so the draft takes aren't as painful as usual on /r/panthers
Looks like Hi-Chew.
Large scale, for the whole country? Not much at all.
As someone who lives in the LA area and does not have a car its miserable using the mass transit system. It is not as bad as it use to be but it still hot garbage. The last bus that gets near my house enters the station at 8 PM. If I want to stay out later I get assed out. Uber and Lyft prices have got up so much as much as I do not want to I feel like I have to get a car again (of course CA is overall one of the most expensive states to drive). You get screwed any way you look at it out here.   Also the people and security of the buses is another issue on its own.
You probably could earn even more brownie points by making brownies for her. Just sayin’.
It's a good day.  And it's a Friday.  Seems like it should be named something...
Read this in Chris Collinsworth's voice.  "Today's a day..."
Where do you get ideas for these? I've been thinking of cooking but I just don't have that angle of creativity.
I loved it.   Especially >!everything in the last episode from the point they get lost in the wilderness together to the end. It's probably my favorite sequence in any show I've seen in the last year. I worried it was going to peter out and overstretch the premise and then they delivered right up to the end.!<
Wait why would it end today?
is it wild? it's gotta end sometime
What’s happening?
You're gonna say this every day until it happens, right?
wild that it is a day indeed
rodgers too!
I have a pixel phone too and it's so annoying how inconsistent google is. They're very good at doing remarkable things but are very bad at doing basic things.
Pixel phones are incredible, not sure what you mean haha
> shouldn’t have a fandom as your identity  That would help most people on this sub
He’s a genius.
Separate the art from the artist
This is a bad take. I can acknowledge my Tribal Chief while also acknowledging that elements of Sunday and nearly all of Monday night's show pretty clearly have Vince's fingerprints all over them, thus signaling the likelihood that we're stuck with his shitty booking again.  If you watch someone's work long enough, you develop a feel and it really doesn't take gossip or rumors or dirt sheets to clue you into what's happening.

don't know about a 12, but my 2018 iphone 8 is *truly* shitting the bed
i've been hard on the film (no jordan anywhere in it) but i may have my mind changed  heck even the mario movie looks watchable
If they still look and taste fine I don't see any reason not to use them. The best by date isn't an expiration date it just means the food will taste the best before that date. After that date the food might be stale or lose flavor.
Mmm I’d say you’re pushing it, but they’re so many preservatives in those things I’d probably eat them Ngl. I am not a doctor or dietician.
[They aren't gonna stop you from jerking off.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_cracker)
What happened?
I’m glad the girl won. The dude looked like Hitler and it was creeping me out.
LMFAO Bro wtf??? Keep that in therapy
Holyyyy shiiiit. That man really had a full breakdown on Twitter for the world to see
So his "apology" is to announce publicly that his ex has trauma? Idiot
Maybe that's why he accused Herbert of being an alcoholic pre-draft
I’m sure they’re buried somewhere in his duffel
that's a good call-out. I was trying to do this for a while but then what would happen is I would start off with too much (protein for breakfast, so I can eat 10 hot wings to get the day started!) and then just keep going.  Today I had a chicken breast and asparagus for breakfast, about 500 calories, and I think that's more like it.  Two things that I know work are intermittent fasting and calorie counting and I've been slacking. But I'm trying to get back to it!
well sure, I'm noting a mistake, not like a "hmm weird why isn't this working?"
For those who have had trouble in the past, as I have, I have some advice.  **Do:**  * Improve your diet and exercise.  * Have good, healthy dialogue with your partner about your concerns.  * Find ways to relieve stress and anxiety.  * Lay off the porn.  * Accept yourself for who you are if you're gay and/or weird but harmless stuff is sexually arousing to you.   **Do Not:**  * Do what this goomba did.
Nah. Peeps bruh.
Here’s a great piece on a visit to the Peeps factory if you’re interested and can get past the firewall. https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/06/magazine/peeps-factory.html?referringSource=articleShare
Sunday is the dividing line between those who believe that Jesus was the incarnation of God and those who think he was just a man.  Today is the day when, details aside, it's broadly accepted that Jesus was crucified if only because the Romans killed a *lot* of people and the Jewish leaders didn't exactly take up arms every time it happened.
My dad's Jewish, though I was never interested in converting; I enjoy bacon too much, I suppose.
Thanks, it's not as though there's a 1:1 parallel with our society today, but I've noticed that there's a lot of lip service about serving people in government and religion, but both seem increasingly disinclined to actually do so.
He posted a whole thread on Twitter last night about how he cheats on his wife except not physically but emotionally because he can’t because he has ED.  Not kidding
Dude is always hyping up the most mid signings for the Bears too
It's a tradition unlike any other... <cue music>
Yeah, I don't watch golf, but I always watch the last round of the Masters.  I really just want to walk barefoot on that grass.
It's a combination of:  * physical activity you can do for the rest of your life  * outdoor time  * flexible enough to give grown up/buddy time (I take my kids to the simulator/lounge, but not full rounds yet), or you can play solo  * you can drink/smoke/play as loose as you want, or you can buckle down and take it as seriously as you want.   * relatively inexpensive - 18 holes and a cart on a Friday afternoon is only $35 for my local course  * you can be just absolute trash at the game and still enjoy it as much if not moreso than someone who's much better
You make a good point, I never thought about it that way
I played golf in high school for my public school. The private school kids kicked our asses
Yep. Guys that don't want to get sweaty and play a real sport.
His ex is also destroying him and its awesome
I needed to read up on it myself I thought fans were clowning him for a bad nfl take before I saw what happened
Idk how you come back from that. Even the ex is trashing him
Sooner people realize we're on the same fucking team the better.
>stetson bonnett.  As a UGA fan, this bothers me more than it should.
parachute time!
We also had a game where you ran around with a pool noodle and hit people with it. It was called Pool Tag.
I’m so guilty of this. I buy a game cause it’s 50% off but then I proceed to never touch it lol
I'm surprised people still play WoW, it was my drug of choice in the early 2010's but I faded from it especially when anyone could get purps during dailies
I played TBC and the first phase of Wrath but launching with just Naxx as the only raid killed my enjoyment so quickly. I haven't even loaded up since like November because it feels like I'm just getting on a treadmill. I did my time in classic TBC and I don't feel the need to come back
Scrum masters run the ceremonies of daily stand-ups, storytime (planning for next sprint) and retros (reflecting on last sprint). They make sure everyone has a chance to talk, and that the rules of scrum are being followed (each ceremony usually has rules/norms to follow.)  It's not PM or PO work, in fact a scrum master really doesn't have to understand the work itself at all. It's all about helping the team work through their own problems by giving them space to talk within the framework of the scrum meetings. So in that way you're right: it's very hands off. The line I've heard is "a scrum master's goal is to work themselves out of a job." Because if a SM is doing a great job, they're helping their team be super high-functioning to the point that they don't need the help.  It's not clear to me if this is still a viable career path, honestly. Scrum was very popular 7 or so years ago but I don't know how much companies value it anymore. My own company used to value it much more. Scrum masters by definition are not supposed to wear multiple hats, but at my company it's exclusively team members, POs, and managers doing SM work as a side-gig.
But I’ve already been shitting nonstop for like a day. Although…I’m a big Crunchwrap slut so it’s a good choice
Peeps are awful
Tbf, they’re spot on about peeps lol
Peeps are understandable, I don't want that sugar anywhere near me, itll have me shitting liquid for weeks
Just report their posts, block them, and move on. You can't let them get into your head and drag you into an argument.
What the actual fuck? That would make my blood boil
"I don't want to put in any effort, people should conform to me".  That's how I read that.
I don't think anyone could've summed it up better.
Yeah my brother has been trying to get me to play it for years. I've been itching for some classic turn based goodness lately.  Was thinking of getting the Switch version until I found my old PS Vita and have it on there. Gives me an excuse to actually use it lol.  Cool side note: like 3 years ago I actually bought brand new sealed PS1 copies of FF9 and Chrono Cross straight from the Square Enix store for like $10 each lol. Kinda neat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Foe8Jet8TVA  just on this one rn
I'll settle for a fridge that can play Minecraft and then I can go in and play Doom.
Yeah I read about a lot of bad experiences seeking repairs. Apparently it requires welding so a lot of repair companies don't bother. We're also not the original owners.  Ordered a new one that Lowes can deliver tomorrow.
I'm sure its great on the newer consoles. But if I'm expected to drop 60+ on these games that are still being released for X1, I expect them to work properly on that console. If they can't be assed to optimize it for the previous gen then don't put it on there.
All these games leave legacy bugs in and it just shows how bad a yearly release is for these games. Madden had a similar thing with many franchise bugs that carried onto the *new* consoles.
To be clear, I am very unafraid of Trump in the general. More afraid than I am of DeSantis, but that isn’t saying much
Interesting. In Cleveland it seems they just despawn after leaving
So my normal life then.
Lol thanks for the tips.  I'm pretty big on my free time, but I'm also ready to lose it if it means I'm going to be a Dad.
Yeah I mean I'm very much a "let people like what they like" guy. I don't understand the appeal of golf and think that golf courses should be razed and replaced with forests or other natural fauna. But I'm not gonna hate on folks for enjoying the game.  I find it funny that their massive event is in fucking Augusta of all places. If you've ever been there you'd know how silly all the pomp and circumstance is.
Monaco for sure lol. That’s a different level of money than even the Masters
Oooh Wimbledon is a good one.  Monaco GP is actually not that hard to go to. My parents went a few years ago and said tickets were pretty affordable and they let you bring your own food so you just go to the grocery store beforehand. They also don't do shit like ban cellphones or kick you out for clapping.
This is exactly it. When people need a lifeline, all they need to do is be deplorable as possible and 33% of the US will eat it up.  You can be relevant by having talent, brains, ideas, or hard work. Or you can be like this and still be relevant. Which is easier? MTG knows which is easier. George Santos knows. Lauren Boebert knows. To keep it regional to you...Cawthorn knew.
Someone should tell that stupid fucking poser that nobody eats grits on sandwiches
its not her im going there for lol   But not really my type
Remnant: From the Ashes. Finished the main campaign yesterday and wanted to get started on the DLC.
My man cave (The loft in the barn) has a 4 TV set up for football and all the other goodies. I just like pissing off my wife
I know people who do that. It's amazing.  Even crazier is I have an uncle who bought a professional video mixing system and hooked it up to a projector so he has a 100" screen were he can split screen and picture in picture things as he wants for various sports events.
Yes, but, excess is fun!
KBXGazelle quit and unsubbed several weeks ago.
I bet it will be a brand-new, randomly-generated Reddit account, too.
No, they're going to link it to one of their safe spaces and bring a brigade in to downvote everything to -70
I get that this started out as schtick. But at this point Reese is just making an ass of herself.   Her exact words on I Am Athlete, when saying she wouldn’t go to the White House and asked about Jill Biden’s clarification was “I don’t accept the apology because you said what you said. You can’t go back on certain things that you say.”   Then today she was saying she is going to White House and literally said she was “just going back on it” when asked about her previous comments.   I would love for the White House to be like “To quote Angel Reese, you can’t go back on certain things you say. LSU is not invited.”
I mean, the Clark/Reese stuff is, imo, great for the sport. Angel Reese trying to pick fights with Jill Biden is just strange and exhausting.
It makes me feel like I’m mentally on the course instead of at work and that has definitely helped today lmao
Absolutely. I don't give a shit about golf, but I love the way they broadcast it.
Lmao that's the stuff of nightmares.
If you like that 80s hair rock vibe you’d dig the band Europe. Everyone knows “The Final Countdown” but they have a whole list of bangers
Perfect mix for that weather.
I was bumping 180 at 5'7", but I've been lifting a lot recently so was happy to put on some pounds. Hoping to get to around 170 by the end of the month.  I should for the sake of clarity mention that when I say "bikini body" I'm speaking figuratively, no one wants to see me stuffing my junk into an actual bikini.
It makes no sense to call it good Friday anyhow. Why is it a good day if Jesus was murdered?
in my experience they usually want the simulated beef tallow flavor and perfected in a lab crispiness of a major fast food chain fry.  Gotta give in'n'out their due, those fries enter the building in raw potato form
It threw me off at first but I actually like how potatoey they are. It’s different from every other fast food fry. They are the single worst fry to eat after they cool off though, I will say that.
We already had Detective Pikachu
definitely the type of movie that will be critic-proof. as long as it's fun it's going to have a huge audience, even if it isn't "good".
I mean it's a Mario movie by Illumination, those reviews were probably 3/4 of the way written before the movie even released. Seems like the kind of movie that you already know whether or not you'll enjoy it.
Especially because Jack Black doesn't disappear into his roles at all. He's entertaining but he's always Jack Black.
Thanks for your feedback! I've always struggled with drawing complicated shapes correctly in perspective and I'd never thought about it being a problem with the shape of the object not the perspective itself  I'm not sure if what I do counts as freehand because what I generally like to do is start from a defining line and work around it(when I draw portraits I like to start with drawing a hairline for example) and I do sometimes draw skeletons for parts of the drawing I'm having difficulty visualizing the perspective of🤔

That's true, but I was on my lunch hour. I had the time to  wash and drain two cans of chickpeas, put them in the Food processor with 6 tbsp of tahini, the juice of one lemon, salt, pepper, about a quarter cup of olive oil, and a small handful of peeled cloves of garlic before blitzing. Whipped it up in the 15 minutes between finishing my lunch and when I needed to leave to make it back to work on time.
Decent Friday?   Adequate Friday?
Part of it is ADHD. I get bored with certain cuisines and move on to new ones. I'm always looking for new things to try. I also watch a lot of YouTubers who introduce me to new dishes and cuisines. Since I cook so many different things I'm able to take ideas, ingredients, and techniques and mix and match. The more influences you have to draw from the more creative you can get. Honestly, I use recipes to get an idea of what I'm doing, but I primarily just wing it.
Oh, they nailed that & it’s my favorite moment of the season. >!Episode 9 is probably my favorite episode of the season, though. The chaos of it all had me on edge. I didn’t think they’d go that far with Jordan being split in half.!<    It’d be interesting to see if it gets a second season & where it’d go.

I would hesitate to call Vince McMahon an artist in any sense of the word.
These fans are more upset at Vince not creating a story they like or having their favorites win a SCRIPTED wrestling match than his hush money cases. I’m talking like mental breakdowns online.   Priorities
This is EXACTLY what I mean.   You don’t know “Vince’s fingerprints” you only claim you do because of the cess you read online.   Fans like you are prisoners of the moment and pretend one show is how the rest of the shows will be because fans like you can’t see the forest from the trees.   Think for yourself and think like an adult here. Vince ain’t in creative. He said it. High officials have said it. The bad man can’t fake hurt you anymore.   You people PRETEND like Vince has been a bad Booker for over 50 years and that’s a lie. Like seriously, think critically and think for yourself.  My take is bad because you’re afraid to veer from the groupthink the IWC laid in place for you. It’s mental to believe falsehoods as true because you’re too afraid to live in reality.   Once you grown ass fans can consume WWE television like a television show instead of being a prisoner of the moment, come back.  Nobody is forcing you to watch WWE. Shit

I actually like they didn't have Michael be in the movie especially since Shoe Dog, a few of the jordan Bios I read and The Last Dance mentioned it was Deloris and Falk who did most of the negotiating and >!when they did Vaccaro's speech at the end about his greatness to him. It really deified him in the proper way as this man destined for greatness. I think if they did cast anyone it would have been too distracting.!<

****SPOILERS AHEAD****  Final Jeopardy, the two-day returning champ is well ahead and two other contestants are trailing. One of whom, at one point, had $200 while the others had around $6k. Returning champ is $15000 in final Jeopardy, 2nd contestant had $11,000 and the third, Rachel who had been trailing, had 10,500. They all get the answers wrong. 2nd contestant bet like $4000, knocking her out. Rachel bet enough to drop her I think $4k, returning champ bets an amount that drops him $100 below Rachel, leaving her to take the throne in an upset the likes of which we haven't seen since 28-3. It was amazing

Classic has been awesome. I played originally vanilla-wrath but never really raided.   Being able to go back and do all the things I never did/get the items I never got has been awesome. Getting Legendary orange hammer in MC, clearing OG vanilla 40man Naxxramas, going into TBC and killing Illidan and the Sunwell, now Wrath. Finally just got Algalon down in Ulduar like 2 weeks ago.  After 3ish years or whatever definitely starting to get burnt out but at this point I'm so close to killing the Lich King might as well stay and see it thru.

That would fuck so hard
it's a fun game, but when a game is a copy and paste, I will be more critical of bugs. So I stand by you with your expectations.
Hell yeah brother, cheers from the couch.
Can only speak for my experiences with kids, but the bulk of my hobby time has come when my kids are asleep. And video games (being something you can do at home) are actually a pretty decent hobby to have when you have young kids.   Other stuff though -- stuff that requires sunlight, or you to leave the house -- is gonna require scheduling and coordinating with your wife (or other childcare situation) in a way that it hasn't before. So I would say if you have hobbies like that, those are gonna be the ones that I think you'll have a tougher time doing in your new post-kid life, so maybe give those some time while you can?  Of course, if you're like me, video games are basically the only hobby I have, so in that case go ham until your eyes bleed. But I realize some people have more varied interests than I do.
Being a dad is the best.   Enjoy it.
There is a reason they don’t have blimp shots at the masters, and it’s because they don’t want to show where the course is in relation to Augusta (right in town)
Nah I agree. Golf is a fake sport for unathletic men to cope with the fact that they can't play a real sport.
Yup. Most of these people are just performance artists too. They don’t believe half the shit that comes out of their mouths. Tucker Carlson’s disbelief in his own bullshit is a matter of public record even
“No. There is another.”
We have a few more around.   One person actually choose to defend guns, somehow, when kids got shot that day. Another who seems too afraid to admit they don't care about others, but pretends to.   There are a few here.

*A sense of sacred irony, of eloquent mistakes, has for centuries enabled Christians to call the Friday of Jesus’ tortuous execution “good.” This is not a matter of putting a happy spin on a grisly, unjust tragedy. Good Friday, and all Christian life, is about embracing paradox. Jesus’ teachings and his death reveal sacred contradictions. The truth that you and I may try to avoid, the pain we’re loath to face, point the way toward our freedom from captivating lies that perpetuate our suffering. When you and I embrace Jesus’ essential paradox—that to lose is to gain and to die is to live—we come to God, who gathers up the broken pieces of the world and makes them more complete and beautiful than they were before they broke. God integrates all fractious dualities into the wholeness of life that Christians call eternal salvation. It’s a life we get to live here and now, by grace and faith. It’s the life toward which Lent has always pointed.*  https://cac.org/daily-meditations/the-divine-paradox-2023-04-07/

I'd say that counts as freehanding, yeah. I find it very hard to work that way because you always have to keep the entirety of what you're drawing in your head. So I pretty much always draw the shapes first then focus on the details without worrying about how they relate to the rest of the drawing, haha. There is this glorious book called *Framed Perspective* (Vol 1 and 2) by Marcos Mateu-Mestre that teaches perspective tricks to draw just about anything, if you're interested. It actually kind of broke my brain a bit because it's... *dense*, but it's very, very thorough.

My dude, I've watched Vince's product since I was a little kid. Trust me, I know his fingerprints. Not going to bother wading any further into your drivel so I'll just leave it at that, mark.

[removed]
yeah mine is...not.  so it's probably my fault!
yeah, but tbh i don't know how much of it is my fault and how much is the phone not being able to keep up with what's expected of it.  the front facing camera is completely washed out, but there's a crack in the glass a few millimeters away so it's probably a question of dust getting in and blocking the sensor.  the back facing camera has this perpetual...i donno, *wiggle* to it? the image sorta bounces around as if my hand is shaking, even when the phone's on a stable surface.  plus the camera app occasionally just freezes and goes black, and i can't take a picture.  on top of the issues with the camera, the earpiece speaker is basically inaudible--and from what i understand the mic is also more or less useless and i'm incredibly muffled--when i'm trying to speak on the phone. and it feels like it's like 75%, 80% top volume when it's put on speaker, so i can only really take voice calls on bluetooth.  then the battery drains *incredibly* quickly if i'm using *any* kind of data, pretty much.  like, 5% every 10 minutes or so, maybe double that once it gets below 50%, and double again once it's below 30%.  it's kinda just limping along, and i'm trying to stretch it out til the end of the year because it's the longest i've ever owned a phone.  but i suspect i'll have to bite the bullet and get a new one sooner than that
I just can't shake that they literally left out one of the most important people in the story. It'd be like telling Star Wars...hey we forgot Luke. Nobody can take Luke's place. Nobody on screen could do it.   "Hey let's make a movie about say George Santos. But let's omit George."
Not randos, in his words he “sexts his ex” occasionally
> people just staring out probably dont have the disposable income to afford it.  Yeah but pretty much any type of hobby or sport costs money upfront. Once you have the basic equipment it's not unreasonable that you'll use it for decades.  I got my first set when I was 12. The woods were made of actual wood. I got new irons when I was 22, but I played with the woods until last year, when I was 38. I got 26 years of use out of them.
Before the days of cross realm or Instance finders you actually had to beg people in area chat or /1 for help. It was not pleasant. I would hope classic wow had area or instance groupings.   As much grief as the game has been lately the best thing they've done is cross realm zones. I used to play at 7 am. Who the fuck else is up at 7 am? They're all at school or work.
Honestly shame because it’s the only way to fly. Maybe I’ve drank the kool aid too hard but I believe in it. It’s a good way to work if you actually follow it. Higher ups don’t usually like it because the value isn’t “hit you over the head” obvious

Tucker on Trump:  > described Mr. Trump as “a demonic force, a destroyer” in a text with his producer
KXGazelle was at least the most independent thinker as a conversative where it didn't seem like she was just regurgitating from Bablyon Bee or the conservative sub. With the other users, I can't make the same claim.  For example, when it was found that the missiles that hit Poland were from Ukraine, two known conservative users made the same joke about how we should invade Ukraine now. They probably aren't aware of what the issue is with that joke. Same with how they both have an increased admiration of Musk.
I mean, it was just a kind statement. Like “both of these teams deserve a visit.” It’s not like she said it should happen at the same time or tried to implement it. She was just be conciliatory. What is the First Lady supposed to say? “Fuck Iowa, dem bitches got slaughtered! Fuckin’ losers”?
The only problem with her kayfabe is that it’s a mess. She stated they refused to meet Jill before the title game because Joe’s bracket didn’t even have them making the Final Four. So it seems she’s penalizing Jill for her husband’s actions.   But she then cited her complaint over Jill’s suggested invite as that women are supposed support each other and Jill isn’t supporting them. Seems pretty at odds with calling Jill out on account of Joe’s bracket.
Amen to that, sister. Maybe I just will.
Book looks cool I'll check it out!  I usually only have pretty vague idea of what I'm gonna draw when I start and I like to sorta let the drawing evolve as I draw more of it and try different things  I have drawn on and off since highschool but I used to get frustrated by doing things like working with strict vanishing points and full skeletons for everything because I would be unhappy with them and because they're the foundation I'd end up redoing and changing them until I just got sick of the drawing lol
Enjoy Smackdown tonight.

Wooooof
Yep that is how classic has been lol. They even took out the random dungeon/group finder that was in OG Wrath. You are spamming trade/gen chat for groups lol.  All BGs and and I think now recently Arena are cross realm. Classic tried to keep the whole "server identity" thing going but the same thing that happend to retail happened in classic, everyone transferred to 1 or 2 mega servers. So there's like 2 servers (each being either 100% horde or 100% alliance) with 30k+ people and the rest are pretty much dead.
Never understood the dick measuring over the "quality" of a metal stick, like wtf????? And we need to commit a shit ton of deforestation so we can have millions of golf resorts.

The game was actually more difficult because of all that. The old Naxx? or whatever in that region under goldshire was pretty dangerous for 40mans. I haven't played in nearly a decade. But I remember the first days of BC before WotLK (LK being what I continue to believe was the climax, apex of WoW fandom, it just went downhill from there)
I’m a sexual assault survivor. Take that back. Wrestling that serious that you need to make a sick joke like this?
[removed]
Wrath is definitely great because pretty much all classes/specs are viable for a raid comp. Vanilla and TBC had too many classes/specs where you just would not take one to a raid because they were useless.  Absolute peak WoW for me though is like the first 2 phases of Vanilla. MC, BWL, and ZG are fantastic, after that with AQ and Naxx it's kind of a slog, especially AQ.  Nothing beats getting 40 people together, getting your world buffs, then having to fight your way into Blackrock Mountain to raid MC or BWL and praying some other raid isn't there waiting to wipe you. Because then you lose your buffs and can't pump in raid lol. Or if your guild is sweaty you get benched for losing buffs lol.
>I’m a sexual assault survivor.  And yet, you're somehow more offended by my comments than Vince himself. Weird flex but ok.

the Nagy Revenge Game in Munich
Guten tag, I have depression
Kansas City is one of the 4 NFL teams that  have international marketing rights in Germany.  [Germany: Carolina Panthers, Kansas City Chiefs, New England Patriots, Tampa Bay Buccaneers](https://operations.nfl.com/updates/the-game/nfl-announces-additional-international-home-marketing-areas/)
Damn the bears going to fly out to Germany just to get blown out. That’s animal cruelty.
Missed opportunity. Amon Ra speaks German and his mom is from Germany.
For the first time since 2003, the Detroit Lions will play in Kansas City.   Was hoping to make it an even longer streak because it's hilarious.
The Germans are some sadistic bastards so I'm sure they will love being put through a 65-0 blowout.
Nice to give the Chiefs a bye week with that extra travel.
That will be a really fun track meet to show off to the international fans
It'll be the first Mahomes vs Fields matchup which will be interesting. We only play the Bears once every 5 years or so.
Superbowl Preview. Germany is lucky.
This is a win for both teams considering how much they enjoy hot dogs and sausages.
Super close game incoming. Chiefs never blow out bad teams. They play down to, and just ever so slightly above the level of their competition. Andy Reid teams rarely blow out anyone, but he knows how to squeak out wins in the most frustrating fashion.
All these comments, watch it be an upset or close game lol
Really wanted the Lions in Germany. This is going to be the first game I’m able to watch in person with Family back home and it’s the Bears?
Damn sucks to be a fan of these teams waking up at 10am and the game is half over already
Man they gotta change that logo lol it looks like Goatse.
[In other words](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/002/503/625/9d2)
Germany is gonna geek out to watch Mahomes   Mahomes gonna have more German fans than Hasselhoff. (Look it up)
This is days old news, my friend.
jokes aside Mahomes vs Fields is a fun matchup for them to see live. Went to the Bears-Cowboys game last year and Justin's speed is even crazier to see in person.
That bears logo is pretty sick. I think more teams logos should have an emblem look like that one. Which makes it ironic that I hate the Jets emblem logo, and always have. But if done right it could be so much better, like the Winnipeg Jets logo
wtf i wanted to go to Arrowhead for the first time in my life :'( Am I seriously gonna have to wait until 2031 for a regular season bears game there again??
Literally Super Bowl Champions vs the worst team in the league   Truly bizarre decision 🤌🏻
Does that logo have a bear with tits on it coming through a window on a ship.  So many questions with that.
I’m sorry Germany. Such a shitty match up.
I think the Bears are gonna be different this year. Beat the Chiefs? Maybe not, but I don't think it's gonna be that big of a beatdown.
chiefs are going to run over the bears like the nazi’s into poland…   too soon?
...... I'm not salty
Lucky Germans getting to watch the Chiefs
how is everybody convinced this will be a blowout?   It’s a single game in a new season, anything can happen.
Is there a reason that the NFL always schedules the worst matchups for Europe games? It seems like it’s against their interests if they’re trying to promote enthusiasm for the NFL, but schedule the worst matchups internationally
What a great way to punish the fans in Germany.  Rather than having the Lions vs Chiefs. The NFL chooses the Bears.  Way to go NFL. What a bunch of stupid idiots.
Should’ve been in Berlin
Was ich liebe
Die Bären hätten Mahomes 2017 einziehen können
This should be a great opportunity to grow the NFL in Europe.   I imagine there are tons of Chiefs fans there and the Chiefs typically play to the level of their opponent, as we can see from the Broncos and Texans games this year.
Not sure why everyone is saying this will be a blowout. The Chiefs always play down to their opponent (and then win in the 4Q).
Lions vs Chiefs is going to be a Monday Night, Sunday Night, or Thursday night game (wk 1?)
So the leak from a German newspaper 2 months ago was correct.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/1188ypw/german\_newspaper\_rumor\_both\_international\_games/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/1188ypw/german_newspaper_rumor_both_international_games/)
What a waste of an opportunity to showcase the NFL. Can also be seen as a gimme to the reigning NFL champs.
I did t know we were mad at Germany.
Please be an away game. They're the best fucking team in football
Schadenfreude Bowl
Best to move this game out of the country.  Chicago fans adore this game and a whole weeks worth of , “Hey the Bears totally could have had this guy. He was right there, right when they were drafting, and they wanted a QB, and they didn’t take him! They took some other guy! Look Chicago, this could have been you, the team that wins all the time, they even have your old head coach, and they are in a harder conference, and they win all the time. But it’s not you, you lose all the time, but you could be winning. You just had to pick this guy, but you didn’t do it. Man, what a bummer it must be to now be playing this guy who wins all the time while you yourself are losing all the time. Gotta be hard to watch, right?right?right?”
YES!!!! I’ll finally get to see a lions game (lions fan living in KC)
We’re on the Germany 🇩🇪
Bears + Oktoberfest? Sign me the fuck up. Now if only I had money.
Germans getting ready to stuff Andy with whatever their favorite bratwursts is.
How many times last year did the Chiefs cover last year? We always play down to our opponent.
I’m visiting Chicago for a work trip in early Nov from the UK and was semi-hopeful of going to Soldier Field for the first time to see a Bears game.  It’ll be just my luck for it to be *the same week* that the Bears/Chiefs game happens…
Mahomes going to pour ketchup all over his schnitzel.
Oh shit, schedule leaks are already starting!
Booooooooo
DAS BEARS
Das Bears
Thats... a really shitty matchup. I didn't realize germans liked watching bears get slaughtered.
The worst thing to happen to Germany in 76 years.
Is this the NFL’s night of Long knives? Is the nfl purging the Bears?
$5 says it counts as a Chicago home game. The NFL would never take away an actual home advantage from KC.
That time of the year for fake NFL schedule BS!! LEEEETTTTSSSSS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Ach, Scheiße...
Don't forget the annual Jags game to go along with it.
Well last year it was Buccaneers Seahawks, which sounded lopsided on paper but ended up being fairly even...  I see the Bears as a team with potential to make a decent jump
The Bears area a helluva lot better than their record and I expect a big step forward for them this season.
To be fair, the Chiefs generally play to the level of their competition so it could still be close.
We went to OT with Houston this year so you never know
Bears have an exciting offense on paper at least, especially if they draft OT round 1. Could be a high scoring game.
Nah, Chiefs always play down to their opponents. It'll be a lot closer than it should be.
The Chiefs will underperform, as usual, against lesser competition, and they will eke out a win either on the last play or in OT
It'll be a long flight home, for the chiefs!
I got to see the Rams absolutely batter the Bengals in Wembley and I loved it.  This sport is conducive to serious boozing
watch it end up being the game of the year
Getting these two fan bases to Germany was a concerted effort by the Brewing and Bäckerei lobbies.
This should be a close game, Germans! Enjoy!
They're used to witnessing atrocities over there already...
On a serious note how are the chiefs the Super Bowl champs being punished by losing a home game
Tbf even though we had the worst record we were not the worst team. Most games we played were competitive, just had a ton of bad breaks (lost 3 separate games due to a WR fumbling in the final minutes for example)
It could have been the Lions :(
Narrator: She did.
She absolutely can and will get mad at you for drinking at 830 am and you can and will still do it.
Hell yeah. Beer and brats at 8 am. Please God make it be an Oktober game.
I think it's supposed to be in Frankfurt
One sports related tragedy in Munich should be enough.
That's exactly what all the Europeans were clamoring for.
2022: Bucs 2023: Chiefs and Pats  By process of elimination, this means the Panthers will host a game in Germany in 2024.
I'm shocked the Packers, residing in probably the most Germanic state in the union, aren't on that list.
At least it’s an away game.
Hey, don't lob factual statements at us as if they're insults!
Lol we never blow anyone out because Reid is too much of a nice guy. Honestly pisses me off. Blow out the bad teams if you can and get all that confidence. No reason to let the Texans force OT.   We will go up 2 TDs on the Bears and then go ultra conservative and let them back into the game just enough to give everyone a heart attack and then probably win on a Butker FG
This gonna age poorly. Someone do the remind me thingy and post this for karma for me later after the game
Yeah this *exact post* will be what causes the Chiefs to drop this game like 24-23 on a late game fumble, and that loss ends up giving the Bills the number 1 seed or something. You’re asking for it.
I love these off-season takes because there is a non zero chance we beat your ass. Any given Sunday (in germany)
Agree. However, his brother plays for Chicago as of now. I think the fact that their last road game against KC 8 years ago was played in London may have played a role.
Chiefs have a cooperation with Bayern Munich, I can’t understand why they‘ll play in Frankfurt tbh.
Fuck it, put us in Arrowhead week one you cowards!!!
Out of context, this is a buckwild sentence to read.
All of this is true for Equanimeous too, and he's on the Bears. Granted, Amon-Ra is a bigger star
What a fucking family
The casual German NFL fan does not know about the two or three German descendent player out of the other ~1600 players and even if, they don't care that much.
Week one, make it happen NFL!!
Have they really not played in KC since 2003?! I'm pretty sure that was the first game I went to, it was snowy af!
Come on down Midwest bros, let's party
"Ja, ja Patrick. Shpank ze naughty bear again!"
Come on man, it'll be at least 65 to 30 with all 30 coming in the 4th quarter
You joke but you guys never really blow anyone out. I’m sure you’ll win but I don’t think it’ll be a blowout
Don’t worry we’ll take it easy in the 4th on you guys
Now I know the refs will be throwing flags like crazy to cash in on Chicago +900 moneyline
It bothers me you said every 5 years or so instead of the objective 4 years lol
Y’all can win but I need Fields to stay untouched and throw for 3-4 TDs in front of Nagy
Why will Fields and Mahomes be interesting?
Is there a significance to the 5 year comment? I don't get that reference.
People in here acting like the bears didn't show promise last year, I expect a good game
Ha! Suck it, Packers.
Not sure why this is getting downvoted. Last year they lost to the Colts, went to OT with the Texans and beat a Malik Willis lead Titans by a field goal in OT.
The Bears played some really good teams really close last year - lost to Philly by 5, the Dolphins by 3, beat the 49ers (in a monsoon, yes, but still a W.) I have no doubt the Chiefs will win that match up, but I think it's going to be a much better game than people in this thread expect.
Yeah it’s real tough to be a Chiefs fan right now
Anyone who actually watches much KC football should already be expecting as much tbh
da bears?!?  lions have a good following in germany too from what i saw
10am? Get a job, hippie.
You guys get to feel my pain for once lol
Haha glad I’m not the only one who saw this
can you link me to a post about it? I couldn't find one
I was at the Lions blowout win at home over the Bears and even in a loss, Fields was scary on the ground.
But you can be your ass that sausage buffet spread they’ll have laid out for them in Germany will be.
Especially since the Chiefs frequently play down to their opponents, and the Bears played some close games against good teams last year (they lost to the Eagles and Dolphins by a combined margin of like 8 points).
The rating for European games are generally worse and they can't be scheduled for prime time. They are the only games on the schedule where the NFL cares more about the fans attending the game than watching on TV
Hey that’s not true. Sometimes we win in OT instead
That was my reaction to this well. I think the NFL schedules a Superbowl rematch for opening night but I think we're getting a prime time game in Arrowhead
It is. Obviously I'm a Chiefs fan, but I think the NFL wants to showcase the offense of Mahomes/Kelce/Reid over there to gain interest, and they threw the Bears in there with the intent of a high powered, blowout win. Unfortunately everyone outside of KC forgets that the Chiefs always underperform against lesser competition.
It is considered a road game for the Bears
Acceptable in Germany, execution by breaking wheel in Austria.
Hey! We actually look competent for the first time in like six years!
The Jags are good now but watch them end up playing the Cardinals
Well the Bucs had a clown at HC to regress them so
Chefs linebackers will have their job cut out for them with Fields. They'll have to treat him much like they did Hurts in the SB with a spy just glued to him.
Lmfaoo sure buddy
Still gonna kick our ass
I dunno, I watched em play and that team wasn’t “put a good fight but lost games” they’re defense just straight up gave up on games   That’s not usually something that gets fixed one off season without coaching changes
Thanks for lubricating.
The real Goku of the nfl.
I think Mahomes just gets bored out there and wants to challenge himself and make the game interesting. Kind of like a cat playing with their food.
1-12-1 Houston who was splitting snaps between Davis Mills and Jeff Driskell at QB. Spicy.
True. Bears could be the 2022 Colts.
Well yeah KC is further away than Chicago is.
Got to make it a little challenging for a repeat.
Supposedly the Chiefs are incredibly popular in Germany for some reason.
I don’t know specifically about your team last year but I get what you are saying. I’m sure most browns fans would tell you that the 1-15 team was worse than the 0-16 team. Not always just more wins = better team
Crazy reaching. The bears were pretty damn ass
Bruh. You literally had the worst record, gave up the most amount of points, and were 31st in point differential.  That's pretty much the worst team in a nutshell.
Jesus Christ. The Bears fandom produces a special kind of delusion
WRs fumbling is not bad luck, it shows that your WR corps has bad ball security. Only the Colts had a worse point differential this year (by two points). You can argue that the Bears were on the same level as the Colts or Texans if you want, but that just makes them jointly the worst at best.
I'll smooth it over with a mimosa for her.
BEERCULES
And by Oktober game you mean late September right?
Rumor has it that both games will be in Frankfurt next season (I’m from Munich and SEA-TB was off the hook, no way Frankfurt will move the crowd like that 😉😂)
I laughed but felt bad about it afterwards.
There's already been the air crash involving Manchester United in '58, and the '72 Olympics, so it's two already.
Germans don't care as much about Wisconsin as Cheeseheads probably care about Germany.
At least it's not Lambeau.
I’m sorry. I’ll always love the bears for giving us Mahomes. ❤️
Nice guy Andy. Big red loves all.
The last time we blew someone out would probably be the Cardinals week 1 last year.
Lol you overestimate our ability to score two TDs
Absolutely. Acting like the Chiefs will score more than 20 points against a non-Top 3 defense is pretty bold.  I predict a 20-17 game. Winner tbd.
I'd say sure, but this is KC we're talking about. They don't really lose to bad teams(outside of Indy)
(X) Doubt
The Bills or Bengals or someone may hold the 1 seed for a bit, but they'll either lose it by Week 18 (Pats, Bills) or lose in the divisonal (Ravens, Titans) as is tradition
The Lions haven't played in KC since '03
Being from Munich I wish they would have picked this city again but I think they didn't like the turf so much :shrug:
Yup I can that’s why the bears got it because they were the worst team in the league and the NFL probably wants the Lions vs Chiefs in prime time at arrowhead.
You know what? They should put us on Thursday night football to start of the season right
Yeah I want this game early and warm
Is he even a lock to make the roster?
Strangely I can see that being a real possibility.   I don't think we get more than 3 primetime games though and one will probably be Lions/Vikings on SNF.
'03 at Kansas City  '07 at Detroit   '11 at Detroit   '15 in London  '19 at Detroit
[Andy Reid interacting with German supporters ](https://y.yarn.co/3aa3e4a8-790d-4fd1-aeb5-180c78d7cc65_text.gif)
Fact. The true Chiefs way to do it is to go down 21-0 in the first quarter, then come back to win 48-28 in Q2-Q4.
Andy really does have a tendency to take his foot off the gas and not show people up. Last time we actuall blew someone out that I can think of was against LV in 2021 where it was something like 48-9. Even there it was 35-3 at halftime and second half had a lot of backups in.
100 percent.  I’d never say we would blow you guys out.   I bet it will actually be super close, with either Chiefs getting up early and then slowly losing the lead as the game goes on, until it comes down to who has ball last.   Or Mahomes makes comeback from down 10 entering 4th Qtr.   Those are the ways we win.  Not the blow out.  Plus, we could totally lose. We are bad vs running QBs
That’s because we’ve had a pretty hard schedule as of late. Next season is pretty easy tho so we might have a few.
Don't forget that potential super bowl match up 👀 it's like you don't even believe in the ability of the Chiefs to make the big one
Fields has thrown 3 passing TDs exactly once in his career, and never 4
*run for 3 TDs
Maybe he thought Fields was the QB the Bears passed on for Mahomes? That was, of course, Mitchell Trubisky
It's not a reference, I'm just saying we don't play the Bears that often so this matchup will interesting to see.
Because afc and nfc teams only matchup once every 4 years due to the schedule rotating.
Nah not people, it's mostly Lions fans for some reason lol
???? They lost 10 in a row to close out the season
It wasn’t meant to be a negative post about KC, but rather that the Chiefs rarely blow anyone out. When they do it’s often against a good team.
AFC South always giving us heart attacks.
Agreed. But, we also don’t know what the teams will really look like after the draft and Chicago has a ton of capital to improve their team.
Not only that, but the Bears had like a 5 week stretch where they scored almost 25 points a game, but only ONE game was a win
Didn’t insinuate that it was.
We’re going to play a good team next year right before and win 54 to 14 then win in OT against bears 19 to 16
Cause of AmonRa
I have a better job than one that has me working Sunday morning
I know that it's been posted, but I can't find it in a search, so it may have been deleted/removed.  Here's an older post from a different source: https://old.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/1188ypw/german_newspaper_rumor_both_international_games/
We don't play the NFCW this year so it can't be the Cards but some of my theories as to who it will be Any NFCS team. If Lamar is no longer in the Ravens, the Ravens The Steelers
Fluke season
We all know the Jags will play in London
Some might even say they'll have their jobs minced for them
Luckily they have a stacked LB room.
I worry Fields may end up being schnitzeled now. Mmmm... Schnitzel and Spätzel.
Our defense was absolutely horrible talent wise, don't think you can really blame the coaching too much.  Maybe the worst front 7 I've ever seen a team field after our mid season trades. And even then....I disagree that we didn't ever put up "good fights". Our offense found a way to put up points, mainly due to Fields, and 7 of our losses were one score games, including our first loss to you guys, despite our terrible defense. We have definitely improved our defense this offseason, even if we are still bottom half, and our offense got better too, including a star WR (and hopefully a 1st round OT)  I'm not saying we are super bowl bound or anything, but it's not unreasonable to expect a leap forward this year, especially if Fields makes the year 3 jump.
I'd like one game of Ultra Instinct Patrick Mahomes please.  That would be a sight to behold.
Only in one direction   *taps noggin*
Agreed, the 2009 1-15 Rams were way worse than the winless 2008 Lions...yet the one win the Rams got that year was against none other  than the damn Lions lol
I don’t think it’s that crazy. The worst team in football doesn’t usually end up leading the league in scoring for a month.
I mean yeah, we were, but we also traded Mack, Roquan, and Quinn so we were pretty obviously tanking and still almost beat lots of playoff teams including the Eagles lol. Next season we won't be tanking
And y’all still barely beat us! 😂  Our defense was definitely the worst in the league, but our offense was dangerous towards the second half of the season (#1 rushing team in the league)
We were one 4th and 20 conversion by the Texans away from not having the worst record and it’s delusional to think we aren’t the worst team? Okay bro
It’s not delusion to say we weren’t the worst team in the league. No bears fan is arguing we were close to being a good team. We all know we were a bottom 3 team.  All dude was saying is we might not have been the worst team in the league just cuz we had the worst record. Luck was a big reason we ended up with the first pick. We literally had the same amount of wins as Houston and got lucky that they had 1 tie and got a miracle Hail Mary on 4th and 20 and then converted a 2 point conversion. We also beat Houston and they were 28th in strength of schedule. We were 4th and kept most games competitive.   If you wanna say we’re the worst, sure you can very easily make that argument and I wouldn’t take an offense cuz it’s a valid opinion. Just use more than the record. It’s just not delusional to say we weren’t the worst when Houston had the same amount of wins, played a significantly easier schedule, and we beat them
It's always the "bright future" teams
If I get mad at you, will I receive a Mimosa?
Ah yes, Frankfurt fans, usually known for their calm demeanor and passiveness
Typical bavarian behaviour, acting like they‘re better than the rest. People came from all over if they got tickets. Ive came down from northern Germany, met people from England and even people from Texas sat right next to me.
Lots of Germans in Wisconsin, our ancestral land will get quite a show.
In return, you must lose this game!
Niners in Week 7. Won by 21. Second biggest win of the season behind Arizona
Wait they’re playing this in Frankfurt, and not Munich? When the Munich game was a ridiculous success last time? The fuck?
If you have to play a Thursday game the first one of the season is the one you want.
He's like their 3rd best WR behind Moore and Mooney
He's still a decent blocker I think.
The Chiefs play the Eagles at home next season so I think it is all but guaranteed that opening night is going to be a Superbowl rematch  I do expect Lions at Chiefs to be in prime time when it happens though
Damn, that was definitely my first NFL game. I remember it like it was yesterday.
Why was it two times in a row @Detroit, like did the scheduling get fixed to not cause that any more just recently?
☹️
We blew out San Fran this year. Blew out the Cardinals too. Both by 21+ points. Wasn’t nearly as bad as the Raiders game in 2021 but still crushed them
Fields has had 3 NFL caliber weapons around him exactly once in his career, and never 4.
And no Lions QB has ever played in a Super Bowl, so I guess that's impossible as well
It's because Mahomes is Mahomes and Fields looked promising last year.
Usually it’s four years unless they share the same position in the standings on the second year (think of Bucs chiefs last year)
last time we played them was when pat counted to 10 on his fingers as a TD celebration- think he was still salty about where he was drafted with respect to trubisky lol
It’s because Fields looked pathetic against the Lions   He had 21 attempts for 75 yards and got sacked 7 times for a loss of 45 yards which puts his passing yards per attempt at 1 yard. Also he threw 1 interception and had 1 lost fumble. Then we have to sit hear with him being ranked as a top two qb in the NFC
Sure, but if I assume the Bears suck, it hurts less when they end up living down to my expectations.
ah, this was when i was in germany well before ARSB was a lion, or even a trojan.
I can’t sleep past 7am from years of conditioning.
thanks, this is a different report so I feel confident saying it is relevant
No they haven't
Couldn’t the cardinals be the 17th game that’s added in?
ive seen some talk about it being us vs yall there
Jags play the 49ers this season. That could be in London
Well you would know
Yes, we do all know that
Lions fans just clawing at the idea of not being worst in the division.
You’ll get the one game where Claypool lives up to Mapletron and LIKE IT!
And despite that we were still had the 2nd worst point differential. You can cherry pick stats to make any team sem good but if you look at production as a whole the Bears were extremely bad.
For a month? Weird ass stat  Let’s think though. If a team was really good at 1 thing, and still managed to lose a fuck ton of games, what does that say about the rest of their game?
Bears have a lot of potential IMO.  Depending on how they draft this year, I could see them being a serious competitor in 2024
Almost beat means absolutely nothing. We’ll see how much that tanking works out
The average NFL game comes down to one score. Almost doesn’t mean shit.
So, your argument is the Bears weren't really that bad because they were intentionally trying to be bad? And that's better than teams that were actually trying to compete and ended with a better record?
Shhh, history won't remember that ... But I will.
Unfortunately rushing offense doesn’t really correlate with win percentage
No, he said they weren't the worst, not that they maybe weren't. The latter is a valid opinion even if it's not probable, the former is delusional
Will I get a thank you kiss?
Randalemeister 2011!
But we had the first game, you can’t repeat that 😂  Just kidding, I‘ll do everything to visit the games next season as well.
Lots of Germans in St. Louis as well. They could host the Rams vs Packers
Tbh Wisconsin is America’s Bavaria.  It’s full of beer, cheese, and [hate groups.](https://www.splcenter.org/states/wisconsin)
If that was the deal we made with Nagy I’m fine holding our end of the bargain up.
I completely forgot about that game ngl. Still feels kinda strange that we just beat them with ease, that defense was *really* good.
It was planned from day 1 that both Frankfurt and Munich will be hosts for one game a year, it was published that Frankfurt will be the city for 2023. But with the success and the 2nd game next season I thought Munich would be a host again and not Frankfurt for both of them.
Well, we play a Thursday game in November every year.
Bill O’Brien was a football terrorist
San Fran was extremely close most of the game
Matthew Stafford
Salty damn lol you couldn't even refute his comment
They’re up there as 1-2 for the most fun highlight reels to watch no doubt.
he barely cracked 2000yds as a passer and had one game with more than 2 passing TDs. Meanwhile, he ended the year on a nine-game losing streak before being benched in Week 18 to prevent him hurting himself on the run because he has the self-preservation instincts of a lemming
If looking promising was results Zach Wilson would be a star
It’s the 49ers
6 AFCS  4 AFCN  4 NFCS  1 #1 AFCE (Bills)  1 #1 AFCW (Chiefs)  1 #1 NFCW (San Fran)  I kinda lied when I said we don't play the NFCW. We do but we play by seed in division which in our case would be San Fran.
I think you would know 😂 Mr 9-8
Well yeah we had the worst defense of any team in the last few years
It means nothing for that season. It means room for improvement for next season. So it does mean something to the bears
I would argue that “almost” means literally everything if what you care about is a watching competitive game, which most people watching it would…  All I’m saying here is that I don’t think we’ll get blown out
We beat only one less total playoff teams last year than the Giants did so maybe be careful about your shit talk, lol
No, their argument is that they weren't the *worst* team in the league.
I have no issues touching butts and make out.
No flopping weiners here. I'll take my mimosa and the kiss now.
Europameister 2022 :)
Inb4 Niner fans claiming their defense was hurt that game even though the injury report lists nearly everyone practicing that week.
I'm just glad we got them before CMC got a chance to really get integrated
That field in Munich was slippery. I hope they address it.
Needed to leave the Lions to win anything
lol he's not wrong, Fields hasn't shown much as a passer. It's just banter.
I mean this is conveniently leaving out the fact that he was dealing with ;   > Not a single reciever ranked in the top 55 by pff  > The least offensive spending in the league  > On a team that led the league in snaps by rookies and TDs given up  > While learning a new system with a new coach in his first full year of starting .  > Meh pass protection (rated 21st overall in passpro by pff)  He still has flaws, but no qb *has ever* (or will ever) succeed with those limitations .  That's literally the 5 main things that could sabotage a rookie qb doing well, and all 5 of them ended up happening at once.  And then in Weeks 5-18 (with arguably the worst team in the league around him) he was  -	17th in Adjusted Comp% (removing drops/throwaways) -	7th big time throw % -	17th in Y/A -	T-13 in AY/A -	15TD/7INT -	12th in passer rating -	14th QB Rate - 7th in ADOT  He's got issues. He's almost definitely not going to be a top 5 qb in terms of passing in this league. But he could very easily be a top 7-15 guy with a good offense while being a top 2 running threat .
Fields goes out of bounds or slides on most runs. Never seen a play where I thought "god I wish he wouldn't do that"
Again, they haven't said this or done this. Superbowl rematches have historically been rare anyway because teams from the AFC and NFC used to only play once every four years in the regular season, but that possibility has increased thanks to the 17th game (which is why KC and Philly play this year) so it will likely become more common
Browns were 7-10 and if Pack/Lions wasn't flexed, Lions were playing for a playoff spot instead of crushing GB's dreams. Lions also got that dog in them more than the dog pound does.
The difference between shit teams and contenders isn’t that large. The 0-16 browns had 1 possession losses to playoff teams 3 times. They had 6 games against playoff teams that year.   You’re really not special here. Close losses are not an accomplishment
Dude, that guy is just salty.
Exactly, we lost plenty of games because of critical errors but we also didn’t play ourselves into 1.1, it took a 4th and a mile touchdown throw into coverage AND a two point conversion and then defense from the Texans to get that. Luck has a very big role in how these things go down. We got unlucky with our games and very lucky with how the season turned out
Yeesh get a room you two
Cheers for that one on behalf of all Celtic fans
Commerzbank Arena in Frankfurt has the field like Munich, 100% grass. But maybe it was a different grass species, I don’t know but the slippery could be the same 🤷‍♂️
Are you joking? His sack rate is sky high because he runs around in the backfield trying to keep lost plays alive, only to take unnecessary hits
😂😂😂😂  Laughable take  1. The dawg pound is where it's at 2. Deshaun was suspended 11 games, of course they weren't gonna play well 😂
Okay so then what’s your point lol. Are we super-ass or are we not.  We also beat the 49ers
Yeah a couple awful calls went the wrong way and caused us to lose/not have a shot to win multiple games. Missed PI in the endzone cost us against Washington, missed PI against claypool may have cost us the dolphins, missed late hit against Atlanta may have cost us the falcons game, awful hands to the face call on what became a pick cost us a game against the lions, etc. We were bad last year, but a stretch of awful officiating and bad luck ended up being major factors as to why we lost so many games
The type of grass definitely makes an impact. The Eagles used the same base grass for their field that was used in the Super Bowl. But because that grass was seeded with a second type of grass (that wasn't used in Philly), the field ended up slippery as hell.
you said his injury risk was "hurting himself on the run", that's different from getting sacked on passing attempts. If by "on the run" you also mean scrambling behind the LOS, then that's not really the case either - most of his sacks were due to a combination of him holding onto the ball too long in the pocket + poor OL play.
simping for a team stupid enough to sign a rapist who has never even had a season as good as Jared Goff's best season to a franchise crippling contract
My point is that you were the worst team in the league last year and your “we played some good teams tight” argument to act like you weren’t the worst team last year is dumb, because even arguably the worst team in NFL history could do that commonly  Gratz on your one good win in week 1
The 0-16 Browns didn't have the #1 rushing offense in the league. And the 1-15 Browns were probably a worse team, they just had one fluke game where they won - record and talent aren't perfectly correlated.  Are you basing this on anything besides record? Because we were one 4th and 20 conversion by the Texans away from not having the worst record either.  If the difference between the best and worst teams is as small as you claim I don't understand why you care to argue about who is the worst in the first place, since according to you there's barely any difference.
Keeps low effort garbage mocks off my subreddits. Phenomenal business maneuvers from PFF 👏
Cool, I'll use it just as much today as I have in the last 2 weeks, and since it's release.
Company charges for a service they provide and everyone loses their mind. This is how DARE told us drugs were supposed to work. Free at first, pay later.
There's literally so many mock draft websites why would anyone care about PFF
Seems like some of you are intentionally missing the point because you don't like mock drafts   PFF advertising a free mock draft Friday two weeks after monetizing it when it was free everyday for years prior is kinda silly and makes sense why some people are mad
Ya know it’s not the same as it was As it was As it was
I like pfn better. Pff has wonky projections
They probably noticed their SEO value plummeted, lol. They were first for "NFL mock draft sim" then dropped a week after.
This is so silly. This mock draft simulator wasn’t all that great to begin with
Mock drafts gotta be one of the most pointless things nfl fans do in the off-season
Guess the subscription model didn’t work out to well
[Redditor] Makes passive aggressive post to complain that they sometimes have to pay for things
Why do people waste their time with mocks?
I'm debating getting the all22 for next season just to shit on PFF. Anyone interested in assembling a shit-on-PFF counter analysis team? 😂
I’ll use this today as much as I used it the last two weeks. Bring it back free period or don’t bother.   The fuck is one day going to do to incentivize people to pay tomorrow that years of it being free didnt already do?
Most subs have a sticky for these to get them off the page anyway.  Well, most subs that care at all.
That won't stop my brother with his PFF subscription from emailing me one every 3 days as I have any clue on whether some 6th round guy was worth trading up out of the 7th for
I can now once again bother my friends with them
The real mock draft is all the shit talk people do after every pick.
Right?!  Now our sub has so much more real estate to bitch about Jets fans.
"Here's my mock draft where I trade up into all top 5 picks, take all QBs, and then barter those later on for more players."
Had the same thought. Seeing Bears fans trade down to get 10 day 3 picks to pick all first round talents in rounds 4-6 is just absurd
If you're a fan of the draft it's honestly a pretty fun thing to mess around with every now and then.   I think one of my favorite things about doing mocks is that you start to get a feel for how you think the draft may actually go, cause you constantly see the order of picks, learn team rosters as you decide what pick or trades to make, and gets you excited for who you think your team may actually draft once it gets to you!  Doesn't always have to be for content. You can do it for yourself. It's just a fun little exercise in prep for the draft. It helps me get more involved and interested in NFL and my team that way. Who knows, you might feel the same!
Hiya kids. Here is an important message from your Uncle Bill. Don't buy mock drafts. Become a pop star, and they give them to you for free!
I never did find those free drugs.
It's just like when people lose their mind over somebody posting an article from The Athletic
It’s more consumer response to a dumb business decision.  Sure they have the right to charge for it. People are allowed to react, call it stupid, and say they’ll never pay. Capitalism.
Eh, it's not like PFF announced the mock draft simulator and had a demo version free for a month before paywalling it.  The mock draft simulator had been fully free for years and then they paywalled it out of the blue. It's their product their choice but it explains why people got up in arms about it.
Never charge for what you used to do for free, 9/10 it ends poorly in business
These idiot capitalist think that their product is so good that people love it enough to pay for it. They don't understand that people only love it BECAUSE it's free.
It has some nice features that others don't do as well. You can trade players for picks, you can view some in-depth analysis for each player mid-draft, and I like that when you trade it'll actually estimate the value each side is getting relative to each other.  (Counterpoint, some things I hate about it. They order players by their Big Board, but by default the AI prefers public big boards, which means that if PFF ranked a player higher than other sites, they'll get stuck at the top in mock drafts, resulting in every mock drafter seeing this *great steal* and picking the same players. Also it'll let you do some wacky trades.)
I care because they tell me what the player is especially good at for higher end prospects when I have yet to see their tape. Plus the grading system is really cool. Not everyone has time to see tape of every single draft eligible player of the top 3 or so rounds.
Someone correct me if I’m wrong but PFF is like the only one that allows you to select players in trades. So you can’t really mock an Aaron Rodgers trade unless you use PFF.
Although I generally don’t agree with their big board, it’s a solid tool with great settings and probably the best trade ability out there (even if it has questionable value issues)
They have _much better_ analysis and player stats available before you make your pick. You can ignore their rankings because they’re often crap, but the cold hard numbers don’t lie and they’re the only mock site I’ve found that has them.
It’s also a clear sign locking it behind a paywall did nothing to improve subscriber base
Yeah, ignore their rankings. But I love having player stats available.
What's silly about it? They're taking something they normally charge for and giving it away free for a day.
i don’t think it’s meant to have a point i think it’s just meant to be fun
It’s only free for today, so I think they’re doing fine
OP is clearly not alone in this to be fair, a lot of people have been griping about it since they locked it behind a subscription. Also PFF+ is not exactly the cheapest service
Commenter makes a passive aggressive swipe to feel intellectually superior. But since we're doing that...  Turns out, putting a service that has been *free for years* behind a paywall pisses people off. Who knew!
You realize this is an NFL sub right?
I think they're a fun thought exercise
Same reason you’re wasting time on this subreddit
Our sub tried that and it didn’t work. No one would use it and with the lack of moderation it died fast and we were right back to “look at my 15 trade mock where we got the 1st overall pick for 3 7ths!!!!”.
Fair. Wouldn't mind if they stayed in those megathreads but I've seen some folk think theirs is way more important than everyone else's
I have a friend like this, and it's exhausting. If I just write back "Looks good!" then I get grilled on what I would do differently, and I mean grilled. Every comment is met with 10 more questions, no matter how many times I say I don't care for mocks and it's all bullshit. This happens with the NFL and NBA, but I find the NBA potential mocks and trades to at least be a bit more manageable, yet still utter horseshit.  The thing is, I don't want to be negative and dampen someone's good time, but I just can't bring myself to give a single shit about mock drafts. And this cycle repeats itself every year. I love my friend, but he really needs an outlet for this mock draft shit. I tried to get him on reddit so he can find his people on here, but he has tiktok and won't get reddit, like downloading an app is too much or he has to pick a side or some shit? So odd...anyways, that was a ramble. Mock draft season is here again, yay.
That makes sense. I dont really worry too much about the draft. I just hope my team picks good people and look them up once they're drafted. I can see why it's fun though.
Yeah I just got 30min out of playing around with it at work and had fun. I don’t seek out much mock draft content but it was cool to sorta figure out what trade downs might be there for the eagles at 10
I've never understood the hate for mock drafts on Reddit. I could grasp it if the mindset behind the mock was predictive with the poster saying, "here's what WILL happen," but it seriously seems like the collective NFL Reddit fan base will engage with every other type of statistic, analysis, fandom-related posts, news, etc. EXCEPT for hypothetical thought-exercises related to drafting future players. It confuses me a lot. Does the collective just not want to engage with the team processes at that level??
Wow free mocks? Christmas really is...all around
if you really love *MockDrafts*, c'mon and let it shoowwwwww
Yeah and it turns out quicksand isn’t nearly the existential threat we thought it would be either.
*and* complain out the other side of their mouths about clickbait
Almost all of PFF’s revenue is from actual NFL teams. In no way does this hurt them.
Nah it's simply entitlement. People want things for free and act like they have a right to use said things for free, then get mad when that fake right gets taken away.
>Also it'll let you do some wacky trades  Do you mean to tell me that the Panthers won't trade #1 overall for Kyler Murray? And I can't get any picks for Jeff Gladney? (RIP)
You can toggle how much you want the AI to weigh the PFF board and how much you want it to weigh what picks real people have made for the teams at those spots
If it's so important to you then maybe pay for it?
PFF grades aren't even serious to begin with let alone for lower rank prospects that just sounds crazy
They’d never charged for it before this year, and even then it was completely free up until about 2-3 weeks ago.
It's just like a mini version of any sports video game's franchise mode. Like, I want to try *my* hand at building this team, that sounds like a bit of fun. I really don't think it's much deeper than that.
You can also get mad when your team doesn’t take anyone from your “perfect” mock draft
They probably wouldn’t do this if they were. I don’t care either way, but if it’s only free for today I assume this is to try to bring in more people.  They just started charging 2 weeks ago.
look, you're preaching to the choir--i'm not begrudging anyone being bummed that it's not free anymore! i used to love fucking around in pfref play finder, and then they started charging a subscription fee for it, which was kind of a bummer.  but i'm also not begrudging them charging for it, nor pointing out that it because it *used* to be free it...should be in perpetuity, i guess?
My favorite was all the trades involving Austin Hooper who was not under contract. Little effort fellas
MFs were getting desperate and screencapping Madden franchise mode trades
That sucks. I like seeing what prospects are being talked about but mocks themselves are really only fun for the mocker.
As a Bears fan, I would've accepted that on behalf of Ryan Poles. Unfortunately, Carolina was faster. Sorry.
I'm with you.  The one on ours is just the same 2 people posting each one they do non stop with little to no comments.  I don't mind reading discussions on prospects or seeing some of the big draft experts, with their reasons - but I don't need a copy/paste of Mock #83 you've done with 7 trades.
Mock drafts are like fantasy football but with absolutely zero stakes and zero results.
Start replying with trade add ons like a ham sandwich, a golf cart, or his mom.  Maybe he'll then realize you don't care to take it as seriously.
Just don't respond?
At least NBA mocks end at 60 and you usually only make 2 picks. NFL mocks are just insanity - 7 rounds of college players across 30+ positions is far beyond what any non-professional could hold in their head.
I respect that. For as much as I love the draft I ironically can't get too invested in CFB, so similar deal
I think Sam said about half of their revenue is NFL teams
It hurts them enough (or they care about it enough) to monetize it (and now offer it for free again temporarily).
That doesn't make any sense.  People were using something for free. Company saw dollar signs and tried to charge. People voted with their wallet, as they're so often told to do in capitalism, and stopped using it. Somehow that makes them entitled? Make a product people feel is worth paying for. Or don't offer it for free than suddenly start charging later with a bait and switch.  To flip it around, the company isn't entitled to consumers' business. Capitalism works both ways.
No it’s a bad business decision not entitlement. It’s like how Subway charged $5 for their footlongs for a good while and when the prices went up they lost a ton of business because the $5 footlongs conditioned their customer base to think the product is worth $5 and nothing more.   PFF had conditioned their customer base for the mock draft tool into similar thinking by not charging for it for years, so the customer base acts accordingly when they see PFF charging for it now.
What? You offered something for free for years. Conditioned people to it. And then charge for it. People have the right to not pay.   If Reddit started to charge you to visit, are you not going to complain? It’s capitalism. It’s how it works. Consumers run the show.
Sounds more like the free market whipped them back in to shape because nobody was buying what they were selling lol
Nah it’s just stupid. There are dozens of other free mock simulators I can use that are just as good, who’s going to pay for theirs when we can just hop over to another site? It’s just a dumb business model
I got the Packers to give me their entire drafts in ‘23, ‘24, and ‘25 for Chase Claypool.
They really need to make the trade values more strict. The Bengals can trade up from 28 to about 12 by just giving up various R6/R7 picks. Moving up from 28->22 only takes a single R7 (trading with the Ravens btw), and then afterwards it gives your trade a C+.
The feature they are referring to is a paid feature. They are paying for it.
Or wait 2 weeks till it comes back for free, evidently
Why arent they serious?
Free trials are a pretty common strategy for any subscription service. Doesn't really suggest that they're doing badly or doing well.
Profitable companies run sales and specials all the time. Wanting to bring in more doesn't mean they're doing bad
What people are they expecting to bring in after only 2 weeks of switching?  Usually things like this are done to entice new users...but I don't see a large portion of people that didn't use it up until 2 weeks ago that now suddenly want it after only 2 weeks of Sub model.  Maybe like 2 years later?  But 2 weeks doesn't really fit the "See what we offer!"  ...oh you mean what you offered 2 weeks ago when I didn't choose to sub then??  If anything they prob drove more people to alternatives and they're like "meh this works better than I thought, I'll just stick with this now"
The best in the Eagles was people using Mac McCain or Josh Jobe to guarantee high return trades 😂
Here's the thing, I feel like FF mock drafts are infinitely more interesting than one for your team.  Like what can you do to effect the outcome of your team's draft why do you care that much lol.
Or be like, "Damn, I would have taken Bryce Young with that pick in the 6th. What do you mean he wasn't available?"
Sometimes your friend is just so into it you feel straight up bad just by not being as into it. It's hard to purposefully joke with it because they might take it personally.
Not buying the product is totally fine, like you said, it’s a consumer choice. Whining about how it should be free, despite the fact that it costs real money and manpower resources to make and maintain, is being entitled.   Also, offering a free demo that later becomes paid isn’t a bait and switch. No one was tricked into paying for something they didn’t want to, and getting to try something for free doesn’t make people victims lol. It’s like getting a free food sample from the grocery store and complaining that you’ll have to spend money to get more.
Oh lol no it's a free perk for only certain players. I love that perk so much.
It was free until recently. So these people are complaining about it no longer being free
Because they said something bad about a player on his team
It was totally free 2 weeks ago. No one needed a trial.
This is exactly how I perceived it as well. Moving the mock draft option to a subscription service was a bold move and there's enough options in the market who will make ad revenue money to disempower the consumer enough to force subscribers.
It's not hard at all.  If you can't joke about it they aren't a real friend. lol
Consumers have the right to whine about whatever they want to whine about. Netflix is a good example with password sharing. Consumer whining drove change.  I don’t get the PFF bootlicking here. They got it wrong, paid for it, and are backtracking.
Just because something costs money to create and maintain doesn't mean it's worth paying for. Maybe it just shouldn't exist if they can't figure out how to monetize it properly.  Of course, there are other options than charging for it directly. We do, after all, live in a time where lots of things are free but ad supported. Or are free but drive traffic to a site where money is made some other way.
The feature to have analysis of each player and their ratings was always paid-only. The draft itself and getting your mock graded were the free aspect.
They do suck pretty bad.
PFF has written like 6 articles the past two weeks talking about how the Steelers biggest loss this off-season is James Daniels. He never left. PFF is garbage.
But now it isn't, so they do?
Of course they *can*, that doesn’t make it not whiny. It’s not bootlicking to point out that people often act entitled to shit. Of course for some people on Reddit anything that isn’t wholeheartedly deepthroating consumers or the working class is corporate bootlicking, which has been so run into the ground it’s become an entirely meaningless accusation here. It’s okay to criticize people on your side.
Lol. Consumer feedback is whiny now. All of you PFF interns don’t get paid enough.
It just dawned on me that the Dolphins rarely ever ran it on 3rd
Interested to see this graphed along with average 3rd down distance they faced.
Would be nice to add yards to go in some manner.  Could start with median.
Rather surprised to see Singletary that high on the list.
Interesting that only 28 teams are represented out of 38 qualifying RBs. Jets (Breece?), Dolphins, Steelers (Harris?), and rams all missing.
Wow, I'm surprised to see Henry so high up on the list. [FootballOutsiders](https://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/nfl/rb/2022?check_logged_in=1) (free account required to see the table unfortunately) has Henry 32nd in the league with a 48% success rate. That includes all downs, so combining this chart and that table would have me assume the Titans run game with Henry was terrible on early downs, and very good on 3rd downs.
Saquon getting the ball every time the giants are in 3rd and 15
Not shocked about where Dalvin Cook ranked. It seemed like 3rd & short as kryptonite for the Vikings
Harris really didnt have 10 attempts?
Man, CMC, Cook, and saquon are bad players
You can tell Arthur Smith likes to run the football huh?
Would like to see the yards after contact average, this says more about the offensive line.
Gus the Bus.
Hmmmm  I guess the Steelers never run it on third down
Brian Robinson is ranked 7th and Antonio Gibson is near the bottom. Guess who dumbass Scott Turner called on in clutch situations? So glad he's gone.
Lamar’s not even on here.
I don't see Najee or Warren on there, that must mean they did so good the chart can't contain them! Right? Right?!?
Of course Henry is high up there. He’s usually sitting on 3rd and long.
I think Zeke still has use in short yardage and in pass pro. He looked good at the beginning of the season, just can’t make it all 17 games.
Pittsburgh RB's getting the props they deserve
I don’t know what to make out of the fact that my team isn’t on the chart at all…
Washed Zeke #8 on the list.
Pittsburgh’s offense being so bad on the first two downs so that they’re unable to run on third down so they don’t make the chart 🔥🔥
Zeke haters in shambles.  This'll be great fuel for NFCE meme war tho.
For this analysis I pulled play-by-play data from last year's regular season only and filtered it for third down rushing attempts only, and ranked the RBs by the percent of third downs they converted (minimum ten attempts).
I gotta be honest, I'm surprised AJ Dillon is that high up. I've always thought he was a decent 3rd down play maker but didn't realize how impactful.
Lol oh Dalvin. You were horrible up the middle but you could always break a huge on off once a game or two
Latavius Murray is a wonder. 33 years old and still producing better than a lot of young starters
Where’s Lamar?
The details are a little fuzzy so bear with me, but the Chiefs were either the worst or 2nd worst team on 3rd and 1 in the NFL, and either the best or close to the best on 3rd downs overall
I love Tyler Allgeier. Can’t wait to see how he does this next season.
Where is Lamar?
Where's Lamar?
This seems like an odd metric to judge a RB with.
This is going to make the Titans subreddit explode. They'd swear that Downing pulled Henry out every single third down last season.
legitimately shocked
It’s funny seeing backs that get used more often in 3rd down situations getting ranked above the lead back.  As much as I love Quadzilla I’m not confident he’s better than Jones unless it’s a short yardage rugby-scrum-type of situation.
I kind of want to see the third down conversion rate of running with Jalen Hurts vs our running backs
Where’s Jalen hurts
Yeah we all know Danny Dimes ain’t throwing that shit lol
I thought Gus Edwards was a likely cut candidate but I’m glad we were able to work something out to keep him on the team. Even when I think he’s about to get stuffed behind the line of scrimmage he still somehow always manages to grind out at least a yard or two
Was shocked by CMC, but then read it excludes passing.
So surprised teams aren’t trying to grab Gus Edwards…man literally is just another Derrick Henry…hand him the ball and run straight up the middle. (Also alligeier is a beast…ATL might have a top offense next year)
So you’re saying we never were in 3rd & short this season? Lol sounds about right
No MIA running backs??? 🤔🤔
Man, Derrick Henry’s really high up on that chart! Surely we’ll give him the ball on 3rd down instead of 1st and 2nd, right?
Why is Gus there and Dobbins isn't?
#7 💪  AND the mf got SHOT before the preseason! 🤯
CMC being on here twice is funny as hell to me. But it makes sense that behind a better Offensive Line he had a much better conversion rate.
Impressed with Stevenson considering our 3rd & Long strategy was to run the ball up the middle.
Ouch (in Viking)
For Green Bay, if Dillon gets the carry on 3rd down then it's 3rd and 1 or 2. If Aaron Jones gets the ball on 3rd down it's 3rd and 4 or 5.
not surprised to see Henry top of the list, the man is a beast and unlike some of the backs at the low end of this chart he just pounds to ball right between the tackles and drags defenders with him instead of dancing around in the backfield trying to find the perfect hole
R. White was the only person on our team to complete a 3rd down conversion last year
Excluding passing plays lmao okay take away half of CMC's game sure
What’s wrong with Barkley?
All of D. Cook's failures were probably 3rd and under a yard. Seems like the Vikes never converted that last year.
You telling me Najee Harris who had 272 rushes and 45 first downs, didn't have 10 runs on third down?  Jaylen Warren who had 77 rushes but 20 were first downs...didn't get 10 thrid down runs?
Not one Dolphin, not surprising
How does Fournette keep getting touches? By god he sucks.
Be interesting to see the average yardage, or even the distributions (although that would be hard to fit on this graph) e.g. which guys were getting 3rd and a foot vs 3rd and 3, or which guys were getting draw plays on 3rd and 15...
we just gon forget steelers?
That Derrick Henry guy might be good
Number one is not surprising at all Derick Henry is a beast 👑👑👑
Gus Bus!!
What about 4th down?
Damn, Mixon at #6?
Uh oh.
Woah! Apparently Saquon = bum
Jets didn’t have one RB with over 10 attempts on 3rd down?
What's interesting too is the guys that usually get put ahead of Henry in the best RB convo are in the bottom 5 of this list. (Barkley, Cook, McCaffery)  Shows a lot about how TN runs the ball like crazy. Henry might really suffer if he gets traded.
How is the performance of the line considered?
Monty is only so low because they just put the ball in Fields' hands on 3rd downs lol
If you want to know if a RB stat is good or not you basically just need to see if Chubb and CMC are top-5. If yes, potentially. If not, no.
Man this is a bit depressing to see.  I will say, Saquon healthy vs Saquon not healthy might be the biggest gap between the healthy version of themselves and the playing through injury version of themselves I've ever seen. The guy looks like a Hall of Famer when healthy and the guy sitting on the right side of these graphs when not.
BRoB!!!
This concerns me. Montgomery is supposed to be an “upgrade.” I’m growing more and more concerned about the Lions being the off-season “darlings.”   If they whiff on Bijan Robinson in the draft I’m giving Brad Holmes an “F.”
damn we got Singletary!
Zeke did pretty good for a center
Mia?
Devin Singletary; goodnight sweet prince. I know some of the fans didn't appreciate him, but he was usually always gaining positive yards every time he touched the ball.
Interesting to see who got the most 3rd down short yardage carries I guess
TIL that Brian Robinson Jr. of the Commanders ranks #1 in 3rd down conversions by RBs shot in the leg Pre-Season.  there's not another RB that is even close
Dalvin cook second to last
Right, but where does Jalen Hurts with three men's hands on his ass fall on this chart?
Bengals guy excluding Pittsburgh. Makes sense.
I’d be interested in seeing number of total conversions
Did you adjust to the mean?
James Connor, still good
Dang Saquon
They do CMC dirty, not updating his uni, when he’s played for the 49ers for uh *checks notes—11 games.
R. White 1.1 is all I see
I'm gonna add first down conversions as an extra scoring category for running backs next year. Think this would help even things out in ppr?
The most convenient thing about being a bears fan is I always know where to start looking for our guys on these offensive charts. Have a blessed Easter.
Can confirm, Swift is pretty ass on 3rd downs. Not sure if it’s scheme related or him (probably both but I trust Ben more), but from what I remember he almost always got tackled behind line of scrimmage on 3rd downs
Woulda thought JJ28 would be higher
I would be curious where QBs who ran 10 or more times on third down stand. Or is it just such a high rate it shouldn't be on there.
Saquon, Dalvin, and Christian are so bad. Definitely nothing conflating results like playing for teams who repeatedly put them in positions of 3rd and 10+.
Put JF1 on this list you cowards
There's a lot of context here. Obviously the standout - what were the average yards needed for first down across attempts. Also what percentage of third Downs in a game were run attempts. And then you've got individual team issues about what kind of system they run. I actually found this initial information really thought-provoking and would love to see it with more data
Should be noted that a Saquon run play really isn't the Giants' third down option most of the time. If you need a third and short, many times the Giants go with Matt Breida, who's really good at converting third and shorts. Other times you just give Daniel Jones the ball and run some sort of designed run play or RPO for him. And the times that Saquon does get it on third and short, it's usually a pass play so it doesn't show up on this graph.
I feel like this is my excitement level during certain games...
Didn’t expect White to be #2 but watching him play he seems like he could be a strong player in the league. Runs hard, very shifty, and has excellent hands out of the backfield. He’s kinda like a super budget generic Ladanian Tomlinson.
Todd Downing was such a fucking dumbass.
Damn Saquon
What happened to Barkley? I didn’t see much of the giants this year, does he not have anyone able to block or is he just not getting the ball? Playing injured? He was a beast
If this is excluding passing plays, where the back get the ball anyways, this is very misleading
pretty sure ameer abdullah was the main guy on 3rd down for LV not Jacobs. basically any 3rd and medium to long it was a screen to abdullah.
Nick Chubb would be higher if they realized he's their best option on third down...
Henry literally head and shoulders above the competition
Wouldn't this be highly O-line dependent?
Let’s go pittsburgh
I think this points to part of why Zeke’s YPC has been so low the past couple years. While he is getting washed, he’s not as utterly washed as a lot think (i.e. a literal bum)   The split backfield with Pollard has meant that a decent amount of Carrie’s has been bringing him in on short yardage and saying “go get a first down”
GusBus
I don’t have the stats to back it up but Boston Scott would be high on this list
Where's Jalen Hurts? Or at the very least replace Miles Sanders with the Eagles o-line.
Barkely... zero WR or TE help.      KEY SAQUON!!  lol
Wow I guess we never did run it on 3rd
Lol who needs a RB to get a first down when you give ball to fields and say "do some shit"
The Falcons FO on Allgeier "Yeah its cool and all that he rushed for 1000 yards with a 70% 3rd down conversion date but he onyl has a 5th round draft capital. We should definitely replace him with someone with respectable draft capital. Like Zach Evans in the late 3rd."
Miami doesn’t even have a RB on the list  Sounds about right 😭
sheeeesh  Alright Singletary
Where are the run, run, pass Stillers?
Christian McCaffery improved considerably after moving to SF
This whole chart is bad use of stats. If you don't adjust for situation you're not comparing apples to apples. Treating patented BOB 3rd and 11 draw and a 3rd and inches in the 2 minute warning the same way makes this entirely meaningless.
We *ran* the ball?
I’m a giants fan. Saquon is undoubtedly the most overrated player in foootball
I wonder where Hurts would fit in when he runs on 3rd down.
GUS the BUS.
Tyler Allgeier and Brian Robinson are very underrated rookie runningbacks
Steelers either apparently
Very much was a huge problem for us
McDaniel wasn’t about to expose that weak OL.
Cost us two games at least.
Rams too, looks like
Too busy running screen passes
The Chiefs rarely run it, period  Seems to be working at least
Meanwhile Panthers have 3 dudes on this list lol. Probably 4 if we count CMC.
we always had that one play where they snap it and instantly float it down the sideline
Great idea thank you, absolutely doing this.
Yeah, I don’t think this stat has much value because of the underlying skewed sample. Saquon, Cook, and CMC play relatively few 3rd & short snaps, so a lot of their attempts are probably 3rd and forever draw plays, or the occasional run play in a passing situation
Haha for real, AS A PANTHERS FAN MYSELF, my first reaction was that if any CAR RB is running on third down it's 3rd and 23 😂😂
That's what I was thinking.  Jamaal Williams in the middle of the pack is interesting since he seemed to be so consistent in short yardage situations last season.  But then I remembered how many times the Lions ran on 3rd and short and then again on 4th and short.  Basically they had a lot of confidence he could pick 2 to 3 yards on two tries.
Exactly this..  Henry would mostly get it on third and short. He wouldn't even be on the field for 3rd and long  Saquon is much more likely to get it on third and long on a dump off.
Yeah that context is needed.  Probably half of Stevenson's 3rd down runs were draws up the middle with 7+ yards to go because that's just how the Patriots playcalling has been (and this "be conservative/do something they don't expect" philosophy predates Patricia)
Yeah it's absolutely useless without that.  Additionally it would also be helpful to see passing/QB Run conversation rate juxtaposed to RB rate.
Yeah, further context is obviously needed because this graph suggests that Singletary is a god, and that’s … not correct >_>
I’d also like to see the number of third down touches because the sample size between Henry and White is probably quite different
It's not necessary. The sample size is high enough that you can assume they average to the same yardage. That said, third down conversion isn't just a reflection of RB but the offensive line as well.
as well as how highly rated their OL was
Also OL rankings.
Yea I have a feeling White is so high because they only run it when there's like a couple yards to go.
Funny to see CmC in this twice tho
Lol. We probably thought the same thing.
Probably has something to do with Allen being a good short yardage runner
Did you guys not like him? I swear every time I watched a Bills game this year I caught myself being really shocked with how hard he ran for his size
guy doesn't ever go down on first contact. that's a helpful skill in these situations. also his lack of speed doesn't really affect him here.
I think it's probably a function of the Bills being in a lot of 3rd and shorts
Blows my mind... the man is tiny. Mad skills, apparently.
Minimum 10 3rd down attempts. Those other 10 running backs may have not had the 10 carries required on 3rd down.
We don't run on third down. We do a little thing called "run, run, pass, punt"
Where does Lamar rank on this also for shits and giggles
Jets RB 3rd down conversation rate is off the chart!
Derrick Henry’s 3rd down carries (only 13 of 349  carries) were all within 3 yards of the 1st down marker.
It’s what happens when you have both a generational RB talent and an OC who loves run-run-pass, as well as subbing out Henry on third downs. He runs into stacked boxes on 1 and 10 with our dogshit o-line and when he gets a chance on say 3 and 5 he kills it but I assume he’s got an elevated level because like I said he got subbed out a lot on 3rd by Todd Downing.
Per PFR, Henry's 1st down percentage on 1st and 2nd down runs (of any distance) was 15.1%.   For comparison, it was 23.1% during his 2k yard season.  I'm with you, I was surprised to see this. Henry's overall 1st down percentage fell off significantly last year (it was 18.6% after being 24.2% from 2016-2021).   But all 13 of his 3rd down runs last year were with 3 or fewer yards to go and he converted 11 of them, and he converted 4/5 short yardage 4th down runs, too.
We clearly should have just ran it on 3rd down no matter what. It's practically a given! 3rd and 20? No Problem
Shotgun draw, between the guards
He only had 2 attempts on 3rd and long (6 yards).   On 3rd & short, he was 6 carries for 8 yards with 2 first downs.   By comparison, Daniel Jones was more efficient. On 3rd & short, he had 10 rushes for 55 yards and 6 first downs.   Mike Kafka and Brian Daboll did an awesome job disguising plays for these guys and did it with little support on the line and at receiver.
Medium Pepsi value right there
He lead the league in negative plays so I'm not surprised by this at all.
On third and 1-3 yards to go, he had 5 runs and converted 3 times. I think the reason he's so low is because we ran him 6 times in longer situations and only 5 times in short situations. Henry didn't have any attempts on longer third downs. Cook's sample size is also pretty small.
Also considering they handed it off to him whenever it was 3rd and too long
He never got the ball on 3rd and short. That would always be Mattison or Ham
9 attempts, 3 first downs
A lot of our 3rd down runs were sneaks or Watt runs so it makes sense.
Only CMC on Carolina.   CMC on San Fran…🤌
Carolina is dragging his average down because we were too shitty for third and manageable even with him.  In San Fran, I’m guessing his numbers were a lot better
I mean, the next time I see Cook move the pile will be the first
Can we have him back please? He was my favorite OC we've had in decades
Daniel Jones was getting the brunt of the work on 3rd down runs and it was working extremely well. I'd imagine it's more efficient than trying to run SB.
Blasphemous to be using that nickname for a Raven!
BRob knows how to push a pile on 3rd and short. Not really that good in any other catagory.
Ngl I saw B. Robinson and had a double take moment like “I thought Bijan is in the draft this year?”
https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/11xffv7/oc_qbs_ranked_by_third_down_conversion_rate/  He didn't make the QB one either
It's minimum 10 attempts. We just spread 3rd down runs between so many players and QB sneaks.
He doubles as a solid pass catching center.
And when we do, you know what play we're drawing up...  ✈️🧹✈️🧹✈️🧹✈️🧹
I mean....he got tons of 3rd and 2 or less because Pollard got us 8 yards on 2nd down lol
This is really cool! Where did you pull the play by play data?
Does this include plays where the QB or another player ran the ball? Or the snap was fumbled, the QB was sacked before passing, etc?
3rd and long:  pssh we got this   3rd and 1: Oh no
Not every stat is “which player is better,” sometimes stats are just interesting
It’s not an overall assessment of the running back. It’s just A stat.
It’s not too odd when you think about how many times teams run to try and convert short distance.
I mean Tbf Derrick Henry had 13 3rd down carries last year…
Even so, under 4 percent is still too goddamn few.
This is a good chart to make a misleading point in that it’s terrible data.
Straight-up *horrible* take.  The main reason Jones gets running yardage is because teams are *forced* to respect fake handoffs, because of who he might be handing it off to.  And the reason backups are ranked higher than the lead back on this list is because you give it to the punch-and-grind back on 3rd and 1, and the serious back on 3rd and 5.  This is an interesting list, but by no means an assessment of skill.
In the QB graph that has not been created yet
He’s usually not there on third down or they don’t run at all.
Per a comment lower down in the thread, Harris had 9 attempts on 3rd down, and gained 3 first downs.  Seems unusual.
Matt Canada already has, so why not?
This is a perfect example of stats not telling the whole story, particularly when it's a single, specific stat. The guy in that chart ran for more rushing yards than he ever had before in his career and if you watched the games then you saw how good he was. Statistically, it was his best year since his rookie season.
Well of course, it’s run run pass punt with Canada at the helm.
Just Matt Canada things
Third and long desperation passes were so predictable last year.
Doesn't make sense to run when you are constantly seeing 3rd and long (thanks Matt Canada)
We would’ve won 1-2 more games if we did run it properly at the end of the game.
I feel like Pacheco will get those numbers up next year with how well he was running.
Yeah 100% need that context.  Because, for example, I’m pretty sure CMC’s rate is so low because he comes in on 3rd and long and isn’t the right guy to stuff up the middle on 3rd and 1.
A scatter plot with % conversion as X, average distance as Y, and number of attempts as the dot size would be cool. Thanks for posting this!
And sample size for each RB, if the Giants always face 3rd and long, and therefore pass usually, maybe saquon only gets half the opportunities other backs do.
It would also be interesting to see how many times their respective offenses are in 3rd down situations to begin with.
Not one steeler in here, bias?
Average amount of defenders in the box also is a huge factor
Can you do # of carries too?
We also have Danny, who is mobile, bigger and heavier than Saquon. IIRC, he was pretty high on the list of rushing 3rd Downs converted which would steal easier conversion from Saquon
A lot of teams now use a tandem back situation. One main back and another short yardage bruiser. On 3rd and short the bruiser automatically gets on the field, so the main guy has unproportional long 3rd down carries.  Also, some teams run on 3rd and short more. Tennessee might never pass on 3rd and short, whereas Eagles (bad example) might always.
Like I know Saquon isn’t a pile pusher, but I gotta think this is more of a fact that the giants weren’t in third and short often.
Shoot makes sense with Gus Edwards when you say it like that with Lamar. Gus is a better down hill runner tho.
I think people thought he was okay, not anything spectacular. He runs hard and definitely earned the name Motor, but he has his faults as well and with Cook emerging people wanted to see less of Singletary.  I was surprised that he didn’t return until I saw how cheap the Harris signing was.
He’s very good, just doesn’t have top end speed. Texans got a good one.
Our running backs are fine. We have several average-ish guys that would all put up perfectly fine numbers in the right system and Cook is probably somewhat above average. Our offensive line is absolute ASS at run blocking and that problem isn’t going to disappear regardless of who our running back is. There’s just certain fans who think it’s a running back problem because it’s easier to dream about upgrading one position than five.
He was like Fred Jackson, always just bad enough that we were trying to replace him but then outplaying the replacements.   We were investing a lot less in the RB position (not constant 1st round picks like the Drought Bills) so this was acceptable.   I think he's underappreciated but it's not like he's a hidden superstar.
I got that, I just didn't do a good job implying my surprise that 4 teams didn't have a qualifying back especially with two of them having guys that carried the load for (at least a chunk of) last season.
Matt Canada taking pages out of Adam Gases book
Now that's a baldfaced lie.  Sometimes it's 'run run interception'
Flashbacks.
And he gains 3 yards by just falling forward
Our Oline was really, really bad last year.
It’s been said but I’ll say it again.  That o-line couldn’t block a tackling dummy.  There were only a handful of snaps all year that the starting 5 were even on the field together.
God, the sheer amount of 12-13 yard runs on first down in the 2K season... I miss those
When you have no interior Oline it happens
Too late
Of course he didn't, why would an RB make a list with QBs?
What a great and unique joke
Thanks! Check out: nflfastR  If you're into data science or visual analytics you're gonna love it. Hit me up at any time if you dive into it I'm happy to help.
Agreed, some data is just cool to see. As a Vikings fan, this data is not shocking but doesn’t take anything away from Cook.
Especially since 3rd/4th and < 2 yards are, I think, the only situations where running generally has a higher "expected points added" than passing.
Yeah, this says nothing about volume, only efficiency.
Oh absolutely, just humerous to see
My take kinda agrees with yours, yet it’s horrible?
I was told he’s a rb
The Steelers threw more often than they ran on 2nd down last year. I'm not a Canada defender but I do prefer that these discussions involve factual information
That's an improvement over his one year tenure at Wisconsin where it was run-run-run-punt.
The Steelers averaged 6.5 yards to go on third down last year, the nfl average was 6.7 yards to go. Especially in the second half of the year they very frequently were in third and short situations. This comment is more of what he’s describing above where Canada is not a great oc, but our fans don’t even know how to criticize him.  https://www.behindthesteelcurtain.com/platform/amp/2023/3/25/23656383/examining-the-pittsburgh-steelers-down-and-distance-numbers-from-2022-stat-geek-podcast
Which games
Has to be the same with Saquon I feel. His team punted on third down for christs sake  EDIT: I was mistaken, I was thinking of the second and third down qb sneaks.
Bingo, for us 3rd and 1 is better handled by Elijah Mitchell or Jordan Mason.
And Henry doesn’t play 3rd and long situations.
If your coach likes to run the draw on 3rd and forever that will kill your average too.
Also if they’re sitting 3rd and 10+ and depending on game flow they’re just as likely to hand it off to him not expecting him to make a first but to gain a safe chunk of yards for a boost in the field position game
I wonder about Henry's because it felt like we took him off the field on 3rd down WAY TOO MUCH
What's crazy is Andy Reid is so eager to throw, I'm assuming Pacheco only got to run on REALLY short third downs. Like 3rd and 3? We're probably throwing there. I'm surprised Pacheco is so low on this list.
Also the stat takes out passes and Barkley takes screen passes quite a bit
And that Gus is, in fact, a bus
This pretty much sums it up. I had nothing against Motor, especially after he cleaned up the fumbles. Just wasn’t worth signing back what Houston paid him. I hope he finds success down there.
The year Fred Jackson broke his leg he was leading the league in yards from scrimmage through 9 games.  The fact that they kept trying to replace him speaks more to the front office being "*just bad enough*" than it does to Fred's ability.
Don't you dare speak of Fred Jackson in such a way.
Bro, Fred Jackson was a fantastic back.   https://www.espn.com/blog/afceast/post/_/id/23586/bill-belichick-loves-him-some-fred-jackson  I have as much respect for him as really anybody we've played," Belichick said Tuesday on a conference call to preview Sunday's game at Ralph Wilson Stadium. "He's a complete guy, does it all and shows really good toughness and can get the tough yards."
Not after the bye week.
I always heard that he was a pretty poor short yardage back and only 13 third down carries seems pretty small. Do you guys have another back you use on 3rd and short, or do you tend to pass a lot on those downs?
That's what happens when you're 9 feet tall.
I mean, most RBs would succeed gaining 3 yards if asked too on a regular basis but yeah
You'd think playing the Bears twice coulda saved him more. That d-line was even more dogshit than our IOL.
Too late for what? Too late for it to be blasphemous?
Nice, thanks! I'm interested in getting into DS/VA but am pretty new at it (I just do basic stuff in excel). Is there a tutorial you'd recommend for R and/or Studio?
I've pulled CSV files from them and wrote a C# program that parses it and puts it into my database for me.  Is there something better to do?  Connect to an API?
I think it does. They should immediately ship him to NE for a 7th.
Wording confused me, I guess.  Now that I reread it, it doesn’t seem as ridiculous.
[We still did it more than anyone else in the AFC so…](https://www.yardbarker.com/nfl/articles/amp/steelers_2022_offense_had_highest_percentage_of_run_run_pass_sequences_in_the_afc/s1_17101_38516742)
They also didn't run as many jet sweeps as people make it seem. There were just multiple ones that didn't go well in the beginning of the season.
Someone like Dalvin Cook is more likely to get a 3rd and 20 handoff than a 3rd and 1
Hey, those were our dark ages. Last year was the beginning of our Renaissance
Wait, for real!? What was the circumstance?
HOPEFULLY he does now ffs
Ha this is a fair take.
Downing was notorious for taking Henry out during 3rd downs. We'd usually put in Hilliard or try to do a dumb pass to our shitty Tight end Geoff Swaim.
No, it’s a by-product of arguably the worst OC performance I’ve seen from a coach in a long time.  We’d run a screen to our blocking TE on 1st/2nd for a couple yards, or Derrick would pick up 6 on 1st/2nd down. These two plays happened at the start of almost every drive. Then if we did pick up a 1st, we’d play action deep for a big miss usually. Then 2nd would be an obviously 3 TE set for a run that would get 2-3 yards. (Edit: how could I forget the copious amount of TE gadget plays to Geoff Swaim) Then Tanny would have a slant dropped for a first down by one of the boat paddle handed WR’s he threw to all year.
Last season Downing was notorious for run, run, pass, punt play calling. I don’t even need to look up the stats to tell you that Henry was often pulled on 3rd downs (barring any short yardage situations). Because our offense was so bad, we were often in 3rd and long situations where Henry isn’t exactly useful catching the ball out of the backfield.
Any chance you heard that from Billy Football?
No he’s good on short yardage as long as he gets a a stride or two. Only time he doesn’t convert is when he gets hit immediately cause he’s all about momentum and he’s not gonna squeeze out of it. He was poor when he first came here though until Eddie George told him how big he was and started falling forward. Our OC is just an idiot
Have you seen his TD rate inside the 5?  Whoever sold you that idea needs to be shot.
Yeah, Downing was an absolute idiot.
Math checks out
Too late to get out the way, bitch! BEEP BEEP!
Too late to keep him from being called the bus. It's a thing. Has been for a while. You're too late to stop it
Too late for anyone other than The Bus to claim that nickname.   Akin to when people tried calling Aaron Rodgers A-Rod.
It will hurt to see him go, but I think there is a decent chance he is traded before/during the draft.
No worries. Happens to the best of us. I could probably have been more clear.   Happy Friday to ya
>Pittsburgh came in at around 27% of the time.  I guess this was the point I was trying to make. I don't know if it's fair to say we were always going run-run-pass when we were doing it 1/4 of the time.  Again...not a Canada defender by any means. I just think the issues with Canada's offense are more in the play design aspects rather than the sequences of play types.
I'm pretty sure that jet sweeps were also one of our more effective plays last year by success rate, lol.  The Canada hate is so interesting because, as I've said, it *is* warranted, but simultaneously off-base and I'm confident that the vast majority of fans who hate Canada only do so because we had a bad offense but they absolutely cannot blame the new young QB, and the next logical guy to blame is the OC, so they do that instead, and latch onto all of the classic OC complaints like run-run-pass.  But again...he *is not* a good OC. Just not for the reasons most people seem to think. Again, interesting situation.
I hope you guys get a weapon and Danny pops off. Bring back the days of investing in a QB and letting him develop!
Honestly from what I remember (I'm definitely not the best source for this) they were just near their own goal line, 3rd and long, and said fuck it and punted. Not much helpful context, it was pretty stupid lol
Only thing Google turned up was McNabb punting on 3rd down vs. the Giants decades ago. Wondering if they're thinking of the QB sneak on 3rd and 9.
It is my privilege to correct you, he is our *former shitty tight end
ROUGHLY
> and latch onto all of the classic OC complaints like run-run-pass.  And people don't like pass-pass-pass-punt either, so apparently OCs need always do the opposite thing on 2nd down that they did on 1st, because being unpredictable means alternating back and and forth in a pattern....
QB sneaked it for 2nd and third down two years ago against Washington. And it wasnt to get a first down, but literally they were so bad at  football.
This is what you're thinking of. They didn't punt on 3rd and long, but they might as well have.  https://youtu.be/uN3GoTFh_JI
I was, mixed it up and thought they punted for some reason. Not that the qb sneak was any better lol
Like when you let a 6 year old play Madden for the first time. Lol  True story: at one point I got really good at defense in Madden. so to troll a few of my friends I would punt on first down and try to win with only defensive points. Accomplished it a few times.
Yup, that's definitely it. My bad!
I’m no madden expert but I used to play. Anyway one time some of us went out to the bar and then played madden afterwards, I actually put thought and strategy into my D and varied up my formations and strategy and it completely messed up his offense. I do t even remember who won the games just that I was able to muck everything he tried to do up by simply thinking.
Why did he draft in the first round a guy who doesn't love football ?
Keim sure has a lot to say for being a dog shit GM
Well Steve, we all knew that coming in. What's your excuse for drafting him?
probably shouldn’t have fallen out that window
Who hears Dan Hanzus singing “*Nkemdiche Nkemdiche why did you fall out that window 🎶🎵🎶*” right now? ATL fans you know what I’m talkin about!
That is something the GM is supposed to assess before drafting a player lol
Steve Keim didn't succeed because he wasn't a good GM.  Dude should just shut the fuck up and collect his checks, his best move as a GM was to not stick with the bad 1st round QB he drafted too long. Sure it was the right move, but when that's your claim to fame, maybe don't talk shit about other people.
Keim is burnishing his resume with hot takes so he can get a talking head spot somewhere.  Which is ironic, because all of his "hot takes" involve decisions he made as a GM.  He's giving his opinion on why trading DeAndre Hopkins isn't going to net the Cardinals what they want, because of Hopkins' contract. A contract that he made as GM.   https://www.yardbarker.com/nfl/articles/former_gm_explains_why_cardinals_cant_trade_deandre_hopkins/s1_13132_38669225
Takes Nkemdiche rookie cards out of their protective cases and into the scrub pile
🎶 Nkemdiche, Nkemdiche, Nkemdiche 🎶  🎶 Why did you fall out the window? 🎶
Who is platforming this alcoholic underperforming assclown? He can’t manage a roster but he can sure sling shit. What a bum.
Imagine being told “you’re the best” at something you don’t enjoy doing. And that this career opportunity will like change your life from an economic standpoint forever. All the talent, all the skill. But you just don’t love it. And people criticize you because you aren’t living up to “your potential.” Don’t get me wrong, I’d like to have millions of dollars, but I imagine that is a tough situation to be in.
Steve Keim didn’t succeed because he’s a fucking drunk moron that constantly drafted the wrong players to force them to play out of position   Happy trails Keim
I still think it's bizarre they extended him through 2027 then agreed to part ways like 6 months later. Cardinals fans are very lucky this dude is gone.
"Let me continually publicly dunk on and sub-tweet my franchise QB" - Steve Keim's approach to being a GM
Johnny Manziel said same thing on Bussin w the Boys Podcast
Sounds like the logic and overinflated ego of a high school football coach.
Steve trying to throw everyone under the bus to explain his failures. Everyone knew he was a risk… why did you draft him?  Steve Keim didn’t succeed at GM because he loved alcohol too much.  I didn’t think I could have less respect for this turd. Guess I was wrong.
Keim taking shots at players and staff members of his ex-employer
He didn’t succeed because his card got declined at the facility and he couldn’t get his workouts in.
Bruh can this guy stfu? He was so ass at his job. Cardinals could've had a lengthy run after 2015 , but this dude totally screwed cards fans for years.
Why is Keim just shitting on all his players?? Wtf is wrong with this guy?
As a Cards fan, it warms my heart that you all also think Keim's opinion regarding the draft and personnel decisions is completely worthless and that he is a dogshit GM.
Nkemdiche, Nkemdiche, why did you fall out that window….
I think it’s a common misconception that you have to “love” the sport to be successful at the highest level. You just have to love success enough to work hard. If you treat it like a job and act like a professional and do what needs to be done, you can succeed. There are plenty of successful pros who don’t love their game, but they do their jobs. It’s a job, you have to treat it like one.
Nkemdiche, Nkemdiche, Nkemdiche…..why did you fall out that window?
Anyone else find it weird that when football people are honest the top comment is telling them to shut up? It’s just really weird
“The poor drafting will continue until morale improves”
Any chance they're doing this to distract from the misconduct allegations?
Steve Keim exceeed at being a worthless prick.
I feel like I'd have trouble loving football too if I worked for an org like the Cardinals. GM talks crap about players, owner refuses to feed his employees more than one meal a day, and gym is an occupational hazard? That would depress me relative to what I'd hope for in the NFL.
Shut the fuck up Keim you dirty rat. At least Robert Nkemdiche didn’t put other people’s lives at risk like you with your multiple DUIs. I never want to hear from this guy again.
This guy is an asshole lol
Why the fuck are we swamped with Steve kiem quotes all of a sudden?
Fuck you Keim.  Scumbag.  No one gives a shit what you think
TELL ME WHY YOU DIDNT SEE THAT BEFORE YOU DRAFTED HIM, STEVEN!? BECAUSE THAT WAS COMMON KNOWLEDGE BEFORE THE DRAFT!!  What’s with disgraced AZ GM’s getting podcast interviews after they get canned for being terrible. Why anyone would want to interview this clown is beyond me.
Was Keim drunk on the job, and doesn’t remember he drafted this guy? He also doesn’t seem to remember he gave Hopkins that bad and hard to trade contract. It would help explain why half of his first round picks were used on players that he then forced to play other positions.
He still plays football…He hates it so much that he’s playing in the USFL? Ok
Steve Keim revenge tour.. This guy is clearly a piece of shit
Me: Steve Kiem didn’t succeed at being a GM because he loved liquor too much 🫣
Robert Nkemdiche: Steve Keim didn’t succeed because he’s a drunk asshole.
Keim seems like a miserable fuck
i feel like this is the reason a ton of guys don't make it in professional sports  injury luck and lack of desire to work hard b/c you don't love the game
this has Tony Khan "I let Big Swole's contract expire as I felt her wrestling wasn't good enough" energy around it
Isn't that why he fell so far in the draft?
Now talk about how much Kyler loves the game…..
People are saying "Why draft him then lol" as if determing someones drive and determination is a simple straight forward thing to do.
Didn’t he pick him?
Steve Keim didn’t succeed as GM because he loved drunk driving and running his mouth too much.
An unfortunate waste of talent
And now he plays for our hometown USFL team, the Michigan Panthers
Not everyone who plays football does it because they love it.  Many do it because it's a way out of poverty.
You do not need to "love football" to succeed. Troy Polamalu has always been adamant that football was nothing but a job for him. Obviously not everyone is the athletic freak Troy was, but he's absolutely correct you can succeed without making your job into your life.
Lots of similarities between Nkemdiche and Jalen Carter
why did steve keim not succeed?
He must be related to JaMarcus Russell and Ryan Leaf.
I like it when GMs tell it how it is instead of canned answers
Who in the fuck gave this dumbass a microphone. I can't think of anyone else who has proven time and time again that they were so dogshit at their job, and then have their owner go out of their way to keep him employed.   Whatever Keim has on Bidwill must be big.
“No true Scotsman”
Why does anyone care what that fat, bald, probable rapist has to say?
I've rooted for Kiem as a fellow NC State alum but man he makes it so hard...
The only reason he had a job for 10 years is that Bidwill needed a drinking buddy
Outside of somehow being able to fleece teams in trades and a few players he signed he was absolutely terrible at being a GM. Contracts, drafting, scheme and vision were not there at all. Every year seemed to be a new direction with personnel and made no sense.
I have heard from a good source that this dude was just fucked up on drugs 24/7 at Ole miss
I mean it was obvious.
Everyone's talking about Nkemdiche having a song in college... must've been a trend cause when I see a post about him, I think about his cameo in his high school's rivalry fight song that made the news back in 2011  https://youtu.be/B6NMA7lAnGs  (cameo at 4:10)
I wonder why they aren’t in a rush to resign Tyler Huntley after his amazing performance in the playoffs. Lamar is amazing but if he doesn’t want to be there then trade him to a dump off team that will pay him and work on Huntley instead.
No, he didn't hate to lose...
nkemdiche had to be the easiest bust to call in recent memory, i don't understand why anyone would draft the guy in the first 2 rounds. i would wince every time i saw him mocked to seattle
He did it twice. Rosen also.
I’d understand if the player hid their disinterest during the scouting process but everybody knew that about Nkemdiche going into the draft.  All he talked about was fashion and other interests and it was clear football was just a way to fund other hobbies.
Because teammates went to his birthday party
There's a certain HoF WR who very famously said he didn't really like football and only did it because he was good at it. He wanted to be a basketball player.
Yeah what idiot would do that
He loved the weed
He drink
Because hiw would he know nkimdeichi, who was just a kid at the time, didn't love football, at that point in life your still not even sure who you are as a person let alone if this is what you what to do for the majority of your life
Because he was drunk
A terrible GM with fairly significant character questions throwing shade at dudes who’s character questions are relatively benign in the grand scheme of things.
Someone has to ask him what he thinks the qualities of a bad GM are.
Reminds me a bit, although at least Keim was an *actual* GM, of Marc Ross on NFL Network.  Man is half responsible (with Jerry Reese who hired him) for the 2012-2017 dog shit NYG drafts and moves which resulted in poor performances mostly on the defense and offensive line. And he responds, after Gettleman fired him, to then question every move his successor is making and talking like how Eli is to blame for their losses and "we tried to get [x] player". Pretty sure he defended McAdoo, too. Most of what Keim has said is pretty harmless. We all knew the Kyler Murray situation and how ARZ flubbed it. It's now being looked at as a mistake but many felt like they were forced into re-signing him because "who else are they going to get as good as KM?".
This isn't really news about Nkemdiche though
He's having his Principal Skinner moment.  "No, it's the players that are wrong"
Even a broken clock is right twice a day.  Is Keim Nkemdiche’s opposite? Had the passion but not the talent?
As a huge fan of Chris Long & the green light pod, I was pretty confused why Keim was invited to be a guest in the first place
i dont get why this sub so pissed and offended that keim is speaking frankly about things
I guess he realizes that he's never getting that job title again. But man he's making as clear as possible that he should never have held it
Maybe he didn’t love football enough either
Fwiw, this all comes from the same hour long interview on Chris Longs podcast. It was pretty awful too. Keim messed up so many details that being the GM, he shouldn't have missed. Like he didn't even know they wore black helmets this year. Dude, you were still the active gm when they did that. How drunk were you?!
People are using recency bias, he definitely wasn’t a dogshit GM. He had the Cardinals in the NFC championship game in 2015 and was in the running for 2014 executive of the year. Of course that track record took a pretty solid dive in recent years, a lot his fault, some not.   On paper the Cards were in win now mode bringing in all these Vets with a QB on a rookie contract these past few years, it just went as bad as it possibly could. He made some good moves and absolutely fleeced O’Brien for DHop who had a bunch of injuries. (inb4 anyone can do that, fact is HE did).   Writing him off as a dogshit GM is a disservice. He absolutely made some terrible moves like Rosen but he quickly moved on from them and actually set a precedent in the league for doing so.
Keim also doesn’t love football enough
Wait, did he not get fired?
It’s why I don’t understand the hate Kyler gets. It turns out more and more the Cardinals are the worst run franchise in the league  2021 Kyler was second in the league in completion % (minimum 75 attempts to get rid of the single game backups or trick plays) and Keim managed to make the public be against Kyler with that stupid video game shit in the contract that Keim didn’t have the balls to keep.   You don’t be one of the most accurate passers in the league without doing your film on opponents defense, but this sub still laps it up
Are there many GMs that are actually ... qualified?  It feels like that job is mostly filled with empty suits, at best.  That role seems like mostly revolving doors of executive-ish type folks with sorta football connections, but really not much real evidence that any given GM is actually good at making the types of decisions that GMs make.  It feels like a job mostly filled by fakers who get the job and finally fail and then on to the next guy who sucks at it.
A lot to say that reminds us how shitty a GM he was. It's pretty funny(for non Cards fans I guess).
Steve didn't love GM'ing enough
Not to defend Keim, but Nkemdiche was mentioned in the same breath as Suh before his senior season IIRC but did have effort questions.   He fell hard in the 1st round and getting him at 29 was worth the trouble IMO.  In hindsight it didn't work out, but if Jalen Carter fell to 29 could anyone blame the Saints for drafting him despite the off field concerns?
"I can fix him."
It was a good homerun swing for where they drafted him. He was a top 10 talent. Plenty of reasons to criticize Keim but that was a fine gamble.
because he was a top 10 talent that fell deep into the first round, this isnt the dunk you think it is
Think about the last time you woke up from a good bender and all the great decisions you made. Now imagine that as a permanent state of being, and you have Keim.
Nkemdiche, nkemdiche, nkemdiche, why did you fall out that window?
If he loved football, he wouldn't have stood so close to that window.
He heard people chanting "defense" and thought they were saying "defenestrate"
K
I swear, that little ditty is probably more responsible for Nkemdiche's fame than anything the guy did on the field.
It’s so nice to find fellow ATN fans. Nkemdiche holds a special place in my brain because of Dan’s antics.
*weendow*
The song (or a version of it): https://m.soundcloud.com/user-16664237/nkemdiche-song-31317
Literally came here to post the same thing. This and the pronunciation robot for Jairus Byrd have kept obscure players alive in my brain long past their sell-by date.
WEEEEEEEEEEEENDOW
How is there not a clip of Dan singing this anywhere?
Always a special place in my heart for the OG AT**L**
Character concerns was specifically why he fell
He could've checked all the boxes during interviews and appeared highly motivated enough to get that contract, then lost motivation over time because he didn't care about the game as deeply as other players, took his earnings, and left.
Easier said than done dawg
yea. it's the thing that's hardest to scout though. That stuff is easy to fake in an interview. You really cant predict how someone will change when they get paid.  NIL will probably actually help in this area
Right, he was a top 10 talent and former #1 recruit in the country.  He fell to the mid 20's, it's totally reasonable to take a chance on a guy that good to see if he can mature with your help.
He made 2 good moves in drafting Kyler and trading for Hop but then didn’t construct a roster for us to capitalize on it. Maintained our ‘retirement home of the NFL’ image, when we really needed young talent.
You'd rather have PR non-answers? Some of y'all are soft  It's better when GMs / coaches just state reality
What’s your point? He probably wouldn’t try and trade Hopkins if he was still GM. There’s nothing wrong with what he did for Hopkins contract at all.
Damnnnn
haha this is what my mind went to as well
weeeeeendow
Can't believe you're talking shit about this poor random guy when your roster is awful.
Do it for like 6 years, then dip out with 30-50 million and do whatever your heart desires. Whether that be jumping out of windows or just partying a shit ton.
It’s an unfortunate reality of life that if you’re not happy you’re not happy. Being poor sure can cause you to be unhappy (in my experience it’s pretty shit, 0/10 would not recommend) but being rich doesn’t really make you happy either. People do forget that, life has its ups and downs no matter who you are or what position you’re in.
Most people don’t enjoy their job that much.
He's not the GM anymore
Johnny had many other issues. He never seemed focused on football. You should listen to the crime in sports podcast about him.
He’s stupid as hell and was only employed cause Bidwill needed a friend
I think it was Marshall Faulk who, during his HOF speech, basically said he didn’t like football and it was just a job.
In this case he's needlessly dragging someone's name through the mud
I don't think it's that weird in this context. He's saying something literally everyone already knew and was mostly known before the guy was even drafted. Keim himself was a dogshit GM who has even worse personal failings than Nkemdiche.   Yeah, he's being honest, but no one really wants to hear what he has to say.
Because sometimes they really should.
Because complete honesty is almost never a good decision when business is involved.  Keim drafted the guy, so it's really just as much on him as it is Nkemdiche.  Shit talking former players makes you and your organization (for employing you) look bad.   It draws attention to issues that should be handled privately.   There's just no good reason to do it. If you work at a job (assuming you don't hate your job, your co-workers, your customers, and your company), you don't run to the press with every little personal dispute.  Obviously if he was blowing the whistle on a serious issue, that's one thing. But he's not, he's just airing his personal grievances to the media.
Jesus…
  He was GM for 9-10 years right? Which 5 out of 10 players were forced to switch positions?
Love this thread: https://reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/8f7uim/round_1_pick_10_josh_rosen_qb_ucla_arizona/
Murry as well
Rosen got paid af too didn’t he?
I honestly had no idea about Nkemdiche, as I remember he was no. 1 coming out of high school. So he had the talent and ability, just not the drive, and you can’t really force that on someone. Kinda like how you can’t make someone start working out regularly unless they want to. Which then begs the question, if football was just a hobby to him (possibly even in high school), just how good could he have been if he really cared?
They probably expected him to still put the effort in, so he had a check for those hobbies and they got a decent pick up on defense.
Something a lot of NFL fans don’t want to hear is that, success in the NFL does not require love for the game.  His athletic make-up was ridiculous so when you take a guy at 29th overall with some work ethic concerns but tons of talent, it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s a bad pick at that point. Plenty of successful players have mentioned that they don’t love playing the game nor watching it, which is fine as long as you take it as a job and produce.
I was living in Oxford while he was at Ole Miss and honestly, I never saw anything in his play that said he was a first round pick. It was definitely there in his measurables but during the games he was just a guy.
People said the same things about Anthony Edwards before the NBA draft and he’s been great.
Nkemdiche. No matter what.
Why don’t you just say his name so we all know who you’re talking about?
Weed is based and Steve Keim is cringe.
Bingo
Keim going on a roast tour right after leaving proves what a clown he is. Most GMs wouldn't do this.
He's not really throwing shade, and it's not a question of Nkemdiche having character questions. His character and status as a person aren't an issue, just because his passion for football is lacking. However, that is a major issue when assessing his status as a professional football player.  Edit: autocorrect
I don't really know if this is throwing shade, we all knew this, and Keim should've before even picking him.
And he just keeps talking shit about people. It's one thing to try to motivate players, but this is just insecurity manifesting (and I know he's the ex gm)
speaking frankly isnt always throwing shade. If something is true most of the time it's worth saying.
Dude don't sugar coat Nkemdiches character, he got pulled over for speeding wrecklessly with cocaine in his car on the way to the facility.
Well even now, who else would they get who is as good as Kyler?
> ~~Principal Skinner~~ Prinnipal Skipster
Getting a GM willing to be candid is a fantastic get for a podcast.
So they could get quotes like this.
I was wondering the same thing. I’m a Chris Long super fan and listen to GL religiously but Keim doesn’t feel like his typical guest. I hope he doesn’t start drifting from what made him different from the other football voices.
They’ve moved on from Wilson and Rodgers gotta find someone else to hate
He comes off as a guy who is pissed that he was fired.  Hes just dumping on everybody after he was booted out the door.  &#x200B;  A disgruntled ex-employee
Because he was bad at his job and therefore, per reddit rules, he is not allowed to have an opinion on things
It's Reddit. We're supposed to be outraged by something.
I think it's cuz he groped that lady in Mexico and then fired the other husky bald guy with a goatee and blamed him for it lol
Pissed and offended seems harsh, I’m just making an observation
Probably because he’s a repeated drunk driver who shouldn’t be judging players characters while he is who he is
It's the soup d'jour..    ..Mmm.. sounds good, I'll have some d'jour
Because he was terrible at his job and if he knew he didn't "love football enough" then why did he Draft him? It's like when you get hired at a job, they fire you for being a terrible worker and then you proceed to talk shit about the place. Your word has no merit
You’re talking to a fan of the team that had 2018 COTY Matt Nagy and 2018 Executive of the Year Ryan Pace
It’s been such a circlejerk for years and most people also don’t understand statistics/the draft/are too young for that matter that I gave up arguing. Dude isn’t near as bad as this sub or cards sub thinks he is. He was also fairly well respected across the NFL for years and tons of GMs loved working with him. I’m absolutely fine with a changing of the guard and think he was just in one place too long, and he isn’t some hidden diamond talent, but he did a ton of good for this franchise and deserves a lot better (football wise).   Dude helped turn this franchise from a joke retirement home for DECADES into a fairly average team with some very high peaks the last 10 years. We literally were SB contenders from 2015-17 each year and just had Carson Palmer or Stanton or both die every single year. People love to lolcards but life really hasn’t been that bad recently and that’s also in the NFCW which has had the most SB appearances of any division in the nfl in that timeframe or close to it, it’s been a bloodbath.  Edit: and this thread is just a perfect example of hindsight 20/20. People are clowning him for drafting Rosen when at the time the Bills were clowned haaard for getting Josh Allen and not Rosen and almost everyone thought Rosen was the safe general talent pick.
looking at his draft picks, he hit on a lot of blue chippers, but it's like all the picks from the 4th round and beyond are forgettable. That's where you make hay as a GM. I'm obviously speaking on bias, but that's where Veach has been really good - beyond printing money - is hitting on those late round picks and having them be contributers right away.  Or flipping low draft picks/drafted players for solid acquisitions. Example is taking Ehringer - a 4th rounder to the cowboys for Charvarius Ward who just signed a deal with San Fran who were 3 injured qbs away from the super bowl
He was terrible at drafting. Not just hitting busts/underperformers, he drafted poorly for positional value. They spent 1sts in back to back years on interior linebacker while neglecting more important and expensive positions like OL, CB, EDGE, and WR.  Then they let some valuable guys walk in FA and cut their interior linebackers who were both cheap and better because they invested so much in the new guys. Then they couldn't make any big moves in FA because they had all their money tied up in players who weren't worth thecontracts because of position value, injury history, or production.
Keim "stepped down" for health reasons.
I think there’s a lot of fair Kyler criticism that his stats don’t reflect. He’s obviously immensely talented. But he’s also got a history of folding in big moments and down the final stretch of the season. Combining those real issues with his apparent attitude issues and massive contract is a recipe for franchise mediocrity.
Spot on
I dont love IT supporting enough
Thats fucking GMing right there. None of that pansy ass dick tugging smile for the camera bullshit. Men excel, men macro their sheets, men sign their new hold out baby before they’re on the side lines. Fucking hard core licking the crack wonderwall goose balls duck it suck it game time shit. Take it to the conference room. Dicks get shoved in places you will constantly remember. We win together we celebrate in the C-suite without you. The GM never needed to be back, baby.
Or he loved alcohol too much.
He does love drinking and driving tho
This is the correct response.
No harm in taking a shot on a guy with talent that may not work out. People probably just have an issue with him saying the reason he didnt succeed was because the guy had effort issues when that was the big issue coming in. Like if a dude cant stay healthy and then fails and the GM says, "if he had been healthy he would have been great." No shit man.
Steve Keim confirmed as toxic gf
We had Bruce Arians as our HC and got Honey Badger to get his shit together and kept PP2 in check so they thought it wasn’t as much of a gamble as it looked. It was a solid basis at the time.
Exactly. Nkemdiche had big red flags that almost everyone saw, but there was a reason he was still expected to be a 1st round pick. He was a huge physical talent and flashed enough to make people believe that he was worth fixing or getting into the right system. Unfortunately he just wasn’t fixable, at least not on the Cardinals
Anyone who watched college knows he's a huge talent that was lazy af. At a certain point, he should be off a gm's board. And if not, be ready for casuals like me to dunk on you if he doesn't work out. A first round pick is a first round pick.
*weeendow
Don't fret precious I'm here. Step away from the window
Right up there with "This one's for John and that one's for John."
This is unrelated to any of this, but I felt like going down memory lane. I fenced in college, and there was a very good sabre fencer from a New York area school. We'll call him "Lex."   One night as a freshman, Lex was being a drunken idiot on a balcony, fell over the edge, plummeted 18 stories, and...lived. The story is that Lex didn't go into shock because he was so drunk, and while Lex broke a number of bones, about one year later, he returned to competition like nothing happened.   Whenever our younger guys would psych themselves out and start saying "I can't beat this dude!" I would always reply "he's a mortal, isn't he? You can take him."   The only time I didn't do that was for Lex. I simply told the younger guys: "Lex is immortal. You're fucked."
Some players will run through a wall for their coaches, others will jump out a window when getting drunk/high.
I still only think about Brock Osweiler because of Brocktober
There’s plenty of us out there I think. After all it’s the most successful football-only, non-fantasy, non-athlete podcast out there
Lmfao did this guy fall out of a window in college or is this just incredibly funny nonsense 😂
Is there a ballpark of the eps for the Jarius Byrd bit? Or is it a drop? I don't think I remember that one? But I definitely remember the Nkemdiche ditty plus they recently played the John Elway song again on the Chaos Pod which is another banger.

Fell out the weeendow
No, it was gravity.
Or maybe there could have been red flags like him getting high and falling out a hotel window.  Who knows a lot can happen
Or perhaps, a GM of an NFL team would be smart enough to realize most people can behave themselves in an interview and that if a player falls past everyone else you should find some sources.
Also wouldn’t have drafted Kyler is his roster didn’t suck so much ass a year before.
Also trading for Palmer for pennies and hiring Bruce arians
When you consider the contracts that came with those two decisions they were both pretty terrible as well.  Drafting a running QB first overall and extending him two years early has put the Cardinals in a multi-year cap hell they'll need to climb out of. Unless the Cards eat over $30 million in dead cap he's on the roster until 2026. Next season he will start costing $45-50 million a year on the cap.  While the Hopkins trade was beloved at the time, it did require giving him a new contract. That contract is now so bad that the Cards are struggling to sell a great player for even a day 3 pick.
It’s honestly funny if you read this post and the Jim Mora post comments back to back lol  Yes, I understand a big difference is mora was great at his job and Keim isnt, but it’s still funny
>You'd rather have PR non-answers?  No, they'd rather be angry. They'd call him a liar if he gave canned answers, just like they're calling him an asshole for giving candid answers.
There’s nothing wrong with what he did for Hopkins contract. My point stems from his talking head argument. To me, he’s stating that the contract is going to prevent Hopkins from being traded because no team wants to take on that contract is disingenuous because he agreed to the contract.   The contract he negotiated is putting the cardinals in a bind in trying to trade Hopkins and Keim is glossing over that point in the article  Edit:  the best analogy is if I was hired as a restaurant GM and set the menu prices. I was later fired due to no one wanting to eat at the restaurant. I then go on the news and state that no one wants to eat there is due to the high menu prices. Completely Ignoring that I originally set the prices before being fired.
What is this reference?
Yea it’s that simple. Ignoring the years of brain trauma and body injuries that come with football. Also ignoring how hard it is to train and maintain the physique and athleticism of an NFL player. Also ignoring constantly being in the spotlight when you might want to live a peaceful life. Also ignoring how you always have to travel and might not get to spend a lot of time with your family.  Maybe if you don’t consider every single one of those things then it is as simple as “doing it for like 6 years then dipping out”
And they're better for it
I’ll check it out. Thanks
>	Yeah, he’s being honest, but no one really wants to hear what he has to say.  Lol. First of all Reddit isn’t real life. Second if he’s being interviewed than at least one person wants to because he asked the question. I don’t understand the projection and the cynicism. He can provide insight despite being bad at his job or having a drinking issue. Those are separate things.
Bucannon, Reddick, Simmons. Thats 3 out of the 9 first round picks he made.  He also completely wiffed on 3 others. Cooper, Nkemdiche, and Rosen.
I love looking at these threads. Everyone cant believe how *amazing* of a pick that was for the Cardinals   Hindsight is great.
[Best comment from the thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/8f7uim/round_1_pick_10_josh_rosen_qb_ucla_arizona/dy2hwqv/)
lol at the "him + david johnson" comment.
"Great pick. Probably the best qb in the draft. I still dont know why the Bills took Allen over him"  brutal
Josh Rosen is one of several QB’s who have proven I don’t know shit about evaluating QB’s
The hot take from the thread is that Lamar Jackson was going to be better than him lol
I think /u/tobblerwobbler is very happy with how wrong he was  https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/8f7uim/round_1_pick_10_josh_rosen_qb_ucla_arizona/dy2bekl/?context=1
>Damn Josh Rosen dropping to 10. Some people were even saying three of the top four picks could be QBs, so this could end up looking like a steal   It's when you realize that top upvoted posts like this could basically be Trump tweets.  >Damn Josh "The Chosen" Rosen dropping to 10. Many people were saying three of the top four picks could be QBs, so this could be a HUGE steal!  You start to understand it's just dumb takes stacked on top of each other desperately trying to sound smart.
I scrolled through both best and controversial for a hot minute. I counted exactly 3 people who didn't like the pick.
Lmao one dude ended up deleting his account after saying Rosen would be the best
This comment didn’t age well  “Damnit stop improving the NFC and specifically the NFCW.  If Rosen pans out, we are now fucked. AFC a graveyard, NFC would have the best QBs in any division.”
No, he only played one year and never got another contract. He was buns
Football comes with a lifetime of rehab, without the love of the game people just won't care.
It raises the question; it doesn’t beg the question.
I was looking for a comment like this. As much as it sucks for fans and people who absolutely loved playing but were just not good enough, many players simply don't like playing all that much. To them it's just another job, good days, bad days, and shitty bosses. The knowledge that a high draft pick doesn't particularly like football doesn't surprise me in the slightest
It happens a ton in every sport. Guys are super talented and sports are the easiest way to make a great paycheck.   I feel like the elite players love what they do, but plenty of guys are fine with just being good/great and making millions. It's easier to see in the NBA where some guys get pretty good and then never develop their game past a certain point.
Didn't Curtis Martin say he didn't like football? 10 straight 1K seasons and walked into the  HoF.
**"Something a lot of NFL fans don’t want to hear is that, success in the NFL does not require love for the game."**  *Cries in Andrew Luck*
He has been.  I think it’s slightly different because they questioned his interest in basketball but he wasn’t already talking about these other interests hd had.  Nkemdiche seemed to have distractions where Edwards just had questions whether he was go giving 100%.  But you’re right, those question marks can definitely pay off.  Your comment made me actually think of Can Newton.  “Experts” threw dirt on him because he said he wanted to be an icon instead of a great football player. He also had outlandish fashion so people thought he wanted to be a movie star or entertainer instead.  Cam had similar concerns as Nkemdiche but was great.    I’m curious what the percentages are for hitting vs not
Terrell Owens.
That was the issue the whole time.
Bluey too, if you think about his DUI.
Or he knows there's no other NFL job waiting for him and he just doesn't give a damn.
Bet you see him run for political office as a Republican
100%, just look at spielman, he got a little bit of a rough firing (it was necessary but zimmer was more of the problem) but you've never heard him go off like this chump
To be honest, while I do think he's a total clown, he's not exactly on the war path. Sure, what he's been saying has been getting headlines, but it's because of what he's been asked. Even what he said about Kyler was a lot less harsh in context, and was sandwiched by pretty high praise. Of course, everything he says will be taken out of context and paid close attention to because of who he is, but he's not exactly just going around openly shitting on people.
I think he thought too highly of BA’s ability to fix players because the Honey Badger pick worked out pretty well, until it didn’t.
That's the thing, throwing shade doesn't mean lying or making things up, it can just be telling the truth in inappropriate ways
But it also can be. Might be true, might be frank but it can still be throwing unnecessary shade someones way. The point being though is that it's unnecessary.
*Now?* At this very moment? Probably someone without a torn ACL.
They have the 3rd pick in the draft they could draft a new guy   Replacing kyler isn’t the issue talent wise it’s the contract Keim gave
In a vacuum, I’d rather have Lamar than Kyler. I might be wrong, but that’s how I see it.
>Well even now, who else would they get who is as good as Kyler?  Lamar Jackson
I didn’t even know he had a podcast. I do now.
True. Just given Keim’s questionable character & Long being a stand up dude I was a bit surprised. But hey, money is money.
Wilson got us a #5 pick, definitely don't hate him
That’s speculation to my knowledge
Imo don’t spread rumors like this even if it’s half a joke, regardless of what you think of Keim it’s not fair to any person to have this start to be spread around.
... i was unaware of this  edit: apparently because it's not true
talking in general about this thread and the other one about kyler. i think a former gm being open about what he thinks about players is interesting but everyone seems to be taking the opportunity to try and dunk on him or say something witty
Yeah true but he did build the team that got Mitch Tribewski that Nickelodeon MVP in a Wild Card loss
Agreed. Keim can be a bad GM, but still speak true criticism of Kyler.
This is why you never succeeded at murdering kids from sewers
Your IT support? Can you tell me why my phones Wi-Fi won’t work? Been on Bluetooth all day and I can’t get Twitter to turn on. Laptop making loud blowing noises when using it too. Can you fix it?
Shit, I was real high on Nkemdiche. I was really hoping for Buffalo to grab him
Except it isn’t a dunk.
I feel like every highly touted recruit who makes their recruitment a media circus always underwhelms.
Jesus, 18 stories? That’s insane.
Username checks out
If you fall 18 stories, live, and return to competition a year later, you deserve a reputation of "end boss".
This is a great story. Don't fuck with Lex.
Dude this is only like 4 paragraphs but if it’s not the most well written response I’ve read.  Do you write?
18 stories? Isn't that like 250 feet. How the hell do you survive that
THIS ONE’S FOR JOHN
Brocktober was a truly special time in ATN history
He fell out of a window in a hotel at the end of his last season of college football.
It was a drop whenever his name came up, straight up just this audio: https://youtu.be/g8YD5ecgsSE  Lives in my head rent free
bless you
Oh hayyyllll no
GMs oftentimes don't have questions about defenestration in their interview binder, so I'll forgive him
If I blame anyone for not getting Larry a ring, it’s Keim
Yep, was gonna mention Palmer as well. Chandler Jones too. And a handful of decent draft pieces, most of which left once their rookie contracts were up.   Still a pathetically short list of accomplishments for a 10 year stint at GM. I think Arians's coaching covered up his flawed rosters.
Hot take, I’m okay with the Kyler contract. Look at what the ravens are going through right now. I’m expecting similar contracts upcoming with Burrow and Herbert.
I'd genuinely rather just not hear from him because I think it is ridiculous to give a platform to someone who was both bad at his job and clearly also has some demons.   But yeah, something about a failed GM talk shit about both his successful players and his failed players rubs me the wrong way. Canned answers are better than being an asshole. Especially when he's the one with the platform and he's choosing to punch down at the players who didn't pan out that *he* drafted.
He doesn’t need to address it though? It’s not his fault that Monti is now shopping Hopkins and it shouldn’t be held against any GM that the person after them has to maneuver awkwardly because of the previous administration. That’s pretty par for the course for any nfl turnover. If there’s nothing wrong with the contract then that’s fine. If he drastically overpaid and that fucked the cardinals over then that would be a point where he could probably take any sort of blame, but the contract is solid and he shouldn’t give a fuck what Monti is doing and is just stating the deal.
On around the nfl podcast the host Dan Hanzus would sing this banger https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/12ej4kh/smith_steve_keim_robert_nkemdiche_didnt_succeed/jfbdiu0/ almost whenever Nkemdiche was referenced
Okay, that's fair too. I was just stating my opinion on it and how I would think of it. I would rather work 6 more years and make generational wealth doing something I hate with some physical risks and retire to do whatever I want even if that includes advocating against football vs work 6 years doing something I hate just getting by and then have to keep going for 40 years.  Definitely different ways of looking at things and how everyone would go about it.
You are the one talking about Reddit comments here! What projection? The comments here are universally saying "I already knew this and don't care what Steve Keim has to say about it." If some people care what he has to say, well, okay, that's why the interview was done.
   So 3 out of 9?  Not half.   And I know bucannon played safety his whole rookie year...he just sucked so they tried to salvage his career with a move to a hybrid type of coverage LB. Worked okay I guess.  So he wasn't "forced" to change positions lol. He just sucked at safety.      So now that is MAYBE 2 out of 9.  And I'm too bored to even worry about the other 2 now. 2 out of 9, few minutes ago that was "half" for you,
The "Trent Richardson to the Colts" thread was another banger
That thread is crazy optimistic though. First round QBs fail all the time. And reports were teams didn't like Josh Rosen the QB but agent sponsored media reporters at the time spun that into "team didn't like Josh Rosen because he was too intelligent".     like what is this:   >Def not, he has a super high floor lol. He’s gonna be great or just average most likely
level 2 [deleted] · 5 yr. ago  Especially the Bills. I hope Allen does well, but I think Rosen is a better QB. [In before this is in a terrible takes from 5 years ago thread]  At least this guy knew.
From the thread  >Yeah it's kinda uncanny tbh, like pretty much nobody could've predicted it turning out this well for the Cards
He was a great pick at the time value wise, when the former #1 overall recruit from high-school, and project top 10 pick in pre season, falls all the way to the last pick of the 1st round, it's exciting to take a chance on them
I was in that thread saying he was a scrub who was immediately going to fall out.  People don't realize that a pair of parents with a lot of money can basically buy enough talent. When motivated to do so, they can buy their son the best nutritionists, sports doctors, summer camps, football tutors, 1-on-1 practices, even surgeons. Start all that when he's 5-years-old, and at 18-years he's pretty much a lock to win State Championship at his High School.  It stops carrying so much water with college - but by the NFL the bucket is empty.  That was Rosen through and through. He didn't love football, he just loved being a football player, and Dad was willing to invest four-years of a Harvard tuition to make sure he had enough talent to be one, as far as that was going to take him.
Lol /u/deepcrows get in here
Yeah, I had a buddy that was livid we didn't draft LaMar after a trade back.  Genuinely angry at our FO for drafting Rosen.
The reply that says ‘ I hope he goes full Deshaun Watson’ is even better
That was the consensus of the r/nfl hivemind at the time
Freaking hell 😂
Who does though?
Oh absolutely, that’s the best kind of wrong!
He's still commenting here as of 2 weeks ago, we'll see if he checks in
Just tag them as “Legends”
> He was buns   Lmao I’m using that
I mean, he also was smoking K2, got drunk, and fell out a hotel window...
I think you meant to say "was his name-o"
I feel like these cause and effects feed into each other on a loop
There's no other NFL job waiting for him. But this sure seems like he's angling for some sort of talking head job. Especially throwing out spicy hot takes to drive clicks.
Yeah he’s never going into a front office again and he’s auditioning for media roles.
Yeah but wasn’t his character concern just getting caught smoking weed?
I think Mathieu worked out well because he had Patrick Peterson to mentor him well.
the truth is in itself worthy in most cases
Yeah which is why they have backup QBs on the team who aren't as good as Kyler who will start. Long term starter-wise there's no one I see available who will be obviously better than Kyler. If the Cardinals end up drafting 1st overall after this season they will maybe trade him but even then.
Why do that when they will likely have their pick between Maye and Williams next year?
It's definitely both. They aren't going to draft a guy third overall when they still have a guy they are paying that much.
Lamar Jackson isn't just simply available.
That doesn't compute for Jets fans, they hate the Seahawks and Jamal Adams for giving them too good of draft picks or something. There's undeniable animosity there for some reason.
It's because it's probably not true. The only evidence is Sean Kugler pulled an "it wasn't me" and some random on twitter said maybe it was Keim instead since they look vaguely similar and people ran with it.
That isn’t factually correct so ignore the above statement.
Funnily enough Pace’s final draft may have been his best assuming Fields is the guy
*NVP
His team building was so bad it had to be torn down like 2 years after it was built. Don’t confuse trading two firsts to never win a playoff game with Mack with actual team building.
Come on man we all float down here
Just Lex being Lex.
Appreciate you. I write when I can. Mostly about fencing haha.
Some people have survived their parachute not going off when skydiving and landing and still surviving. Humans are weird. https://www.timesnownews.com/viral/when-a-skydiver-failed-to-open-his-parachute-but-miraculously-survived-a-8000-feet-fall-article-96758702
The height depends on the building - there are plenty where a story is only 10ft, so possibly as few as 180ft. The record for highest fall survived without a parachute goes to a Serbian flight attendant who fell >30K feet and lived. Her survival is attributed to being trapped in part of the airplane as it fell, and it crumpling on impact and absorbing the impact energy. A similar thing could happen with a car roof.

[Its even better than I remembered lmao](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/1mo7d1/browns_rb_trent_richardson_to_indy_for_colts/). "I don't think I've ever been so fucking pissed at this franchise" - /u/docauch I hope you have found it within yourself to forgive.   Richardson is such an interesting story, honestly. He and Zeke were really the high-water point for an RB at the top of the draft.
He did wreck in fantasy his rookie year...
I hate to admit it but I thought the Luck+Richardson combo would be absolutely amazing. And then I ended up doing a film breakdown of how Trent Richardson can't read a god damn hole in a zone blocking scheme to save his fucking life.
HAHAHAHA an all-timer
There’s a good chunk of “if he works out” though also. Definitely over optimistic on the average, but there’s hesitance. The funniest part is that injury was the biggest concern mentioned. Little did they know…
One of the worst ones I saw was from a Bills fan saying they “drafted the wrong Josh”  Crazy lol
I thought that's what they just linked to?
You NEVER go full Watson!
It was right there….
Apparently he’s going to be on some draft broadcast this year
Nah he was in a lot of drama and had questionable character beyond smoking weed. His general demeanor was not considered positive. I don't have any specifics but in short... he was a dickhead.
He was also selling weed which I remember thinking wasn't a character concern at all cause only broke college kids need to do that, millionaire NFL stars don't really need to sell weed.
...Lamar?   I genuinely think that r/nfl has gone so far around on Lamar that he's somehow ended up extremely underrated. As a fan of a team in the AFCN, he's *insanely* good, and the injury concerns are being vastly overblown.   The fact that the Ravens might get him back at 30 million for a year would make me furious if I thought he'd ever play on it.
Give Baltimore 2 first round picks and give him his contract and I bet he says yes to anyone.
On what planet did I mention hating the Seahawks? I’m rooting for Geno but lol sounds like someone’s a little on edge.  But yeah now that you triggered me, enjoy President ‘Mal! #prez
cant trust anyone outchea smh
I was commenting about the Cards previously and made a joke about the Bears. Never said the Bears truly built anything.
If not for Brock Lobster that Bears team goes to the Super Bowl.
Average Wednesday night for him, really.
It doesn't seem possible to fall from 150-200 feet and live? What did he land on, a giant foam pit?
Don’t be shy, we’ve all read your Mike Glennon erotica. It’s high quality.
Peggy Hill iirc
Really it’s their safety that stops Larry from gaining on Harrison and make a tackle at the 5 yard line. Cardinals win the Super Bowl there. Still gutted for my bird bro.
Keim shoulda gotten one of the greatest wr’s ever to more than one sb. Harrison was unfortunate, but that’s football.
Harrison made an amazing play. Steve Keim wasted years of that team
Didn't they spend the FRP from Richardson on Johnny Fucking Football?
lol I remember this thread fondly. I forgave them for dumping TRich, for sure.   I’m out on the Browns now though. Haslam is a fucking clown and I can’t get behind having a serial sexual predator as the face of the franchise.  I love pain though, so Ive gotten on board with the Chargers. At least Herbert is a dreamboat with a cannon arm and they have sick unis.
"Weeden is so bad another team picked off one of their players" 😂
Saquon went 2nd overall in 2018
That wasn't just a Bills fan that was r/NFL in general. And we will learn nothing just like every other time. Rosen was this Subs favorite QB of that draft and any team who drafted Allen High would get laughed at
My bad, I thought he was pointing out the prescient comment on Lamar being great above that.
Nah that's "peek-a-boo"  Different game bro
It's yet another thing that makes your realize the draft is a total crapshoot. Mathieu was a certified headass coming out of the draft, but was still 21 and very capable of maturing, which he did. Nobody truly knows how any of these kids will pan out because when they're that young, they still don't know what the fuck they're gonna do in life.
As an LSU fan it was mostly getting kicked off the team for failing drug tests for weed. After begging and Les finally saying no he realized he had to do better. That’s about it
He mentions in the interview on Green light pod that Honey Badgers love for football kept him in a straight line in the pros and how that can be a deterrent for a lot of players to overcome their pre draft red flags.  I feel this provides a little context to the quote, but Im not familiar with Robert's story and why he may have not panned out.
Yeah but the problem is that there isn't an easily foreseeable deal in place where they could get him and get rid of Kyler. Lamar isn't simply "Available" per se. Maybe they could trade Kyler and #3 for Lamar? Idk. I also think Kyler is underrated as well and has been held back by mediocre coaching.
The risk/reward of Lamar and the amount of money that he wants isn't worth it IMO, regardless of how he's rated.
It sure is something. You never know which way a thread will flip. Lamar is sometimes a top level guy who deserves all the money and other times he a gimmick who can barely throw a football and will never be a pocket passer.  I get the money thing is huge and he probably isn't handling it right, but Lamar is so fucking good. He has bailed out the Ravens a ridiculous amount of times and just wins fucking games.
You guys just can’t help yourselves. We even have a rule in the sidebar of our sub that is basically “don’t be like jets fans “
My bad!   Also funny because my only point is like “nah trust me, even when we were good for a little bit we still just sucked like always”
A car, I believe. So very similar to a giant foam pit if you use your imagination.
I watched a documentary where the main character fell from a similar height & survived because he was hitting things on the way down. He needed a homeless dude to carry him away on his shopping cart. I'm not totally sure how long it took him, but he did eventually get back into fighting condition.
Go birds (actual eagles, not just bird teams.)  I like your squad a lot.
And the officiating was horrible in that game.
Mr. Bad Choices
Yes Lol
Chargers Powders Blue is top 2 in the league
If only there was a team in the same state as the browns that had an equally handsome if not slightly better QB
his rookie year at training camp they had him room with Justin Bethel because Justin was basically super boring and they figured he’d help Tyrann mature, which seemed to work.  source: justin’s college head coach
kyler + 3 for lamar is fireable. Lamar is better than Kyler but he's not *that* much better
It's why it's so bonkers to me the way your FO is handling things. They're in a Super Bowl window *right now* with an MVP level QB who almost definitely could've played in the playoffs last year but held out due to a combination of injury and contract. You could've won the Super Bowl last year!  I know that if the Bengals ever treated Burrow that way, I'd be livid.  It's not a question of "Is he worth it?", it's a question of how much money does he want. If Burrow decided that he wanted a fully guaranteed deal and that was the only way he'd sign, the Bengals FO would figure out a way to crunch the numbers to do it. Conversely the Ravens FO has seemingly at every step of the way been resistant to giving Lamar what he's asked for, planting stories in the media about how selfish he's being. It's crazy to watch from the outside.
All good, at least you made the playoffs in the last 13 years!
I struggle to believe it's possible to fall from that high onto a car and live...   this is about the height you're talking about, for reference.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1EQdWp0Ggo   unless this is some kind of copypasta or joke that I'm missing

Like most recent steeler super bowls
Mr. Binges Coke
*they're cleeeeeeeeeeeeeean*
Eagles Kelly Green and yup I see why you said top 2
Even chargers fans know the Raiders have the best jerseys in the game.
Too close to home.
Here’s a question:   Would you rather have made the playoffs once in 13 years but lose the first game on a double doink, or never had made the playoffs at all?
[A number of people](https://www.statista.com/chart/19708/known-occasions-where-people-survived-falls/) have survived falling out of airplanes without parachutes before, so falling 18 stories onto a car roof (which can crumple, acting as a very, very bad cushion) while drunk isn't impossible.  ETA: There's an NYC [window washer](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-39114931) who survived a 47 story fall.
Luckily the Bowery King had someone there to rescue him.
I respect your opinion, but I was putting our blues in the top 2 with the Powder Blues lol
idk the double doink obviously sucked but before that our last playoff game was the same day the jets was. and thats not a cool reality to think about lol
Jesus, imagine having several seconds to come to terms with your death, coming to terms with it, experiencing the horrific pain as everything in your body breaks … and living
damn dude
Fucking way she goes, boys
If Pete wants to run 3 safety sets on the field, why didn’t they sign him? Love, Adams, and Diggs can’t all 3 be on the field 100% of the snaps. Especially since Neal took the league vet minimum from the Bucs? I feel like this doesn’t make sense
He hates them, doesn’t he?
Crazy seeing Ryan and Mike Neal from my high school both end up in the NFL. And Eugene Wilson!  Merrillville Pirates for life!
For those unaware:  he was the highest-graded safety last year on PFF (or one of those sites), and just signed a vet min deal with the Bucs.  By all accounts, he’s very well-liked in the locker room, and (in my eyes) is likely the best bargain in the NFL now.
Bby come back
Meanwhile Ekeler: The chargers killed my first born child and slept with my wife
Hope he does well in Tampa. Loved having him here and wish we kept him
I feel like people are getting Wooshed by the Julian Love pun here.
There she blows, run a tight ship or some sailor/buccaneer aphorism.   We need him the Seahawks are fine :)
Fun fact: the NFL frowns upon piss jugs on camera and Pete Carroll's gum habit is just to distract him from his tiny bladder.
Sometimes she goes, sometimes she don't go
My guess at the situation is that Ryan requested a chance to sign somewhere that he wouldn’t be the 4th option, and PCJS granted him that chance.
For me it would be bitter. Balled out for them and they were remarkably better with him on the field and then they go sign love and say go find a job somewhere else.
Richard Sherman's already prepping to use this as a jump-off point.
Spanos rhymes with Thanos, you guys shoulda seen the writing on the wall
Well we're fine now because we just signed a different safety for two years at about $6m/year, but Neal's single-year vet minimum deal does leave some of us wondering exactly what happened. I fully understand the argument that he wants a chance to start but the disparity makes me think there were additional factors.
He was good not great. They bringing in someone in hopes of being great. It is a risk decision but its business.
Spanos also rhymes with banos 💩
That's Julian Love, though.  *"He was good not great"*
Love has been around for 5 years and has never been ‘great’ lol
This is bullshit because Seahawks fans worship much worse players.  Like everyone is itching like a crack addict to sign brooks even though he’s the definition of mid.  Or everyone loves the uncle will contract even though he’s also a mid, highly injured TE.  To me it’s a bad idea to have over 100 mil locked up in safety but it’s really bad when you let your best one go for pennies, and love who you signed to play all over now has to play SS week 1 when Jamal goes out.  And then diggs is just going to be 30 years old.  Is it business or is it “we fucked up and payed two stooges”.  If we had signed Neal the response would have been “omg he was all pro by pff” but we didn’t so the narrative changes to “he wasn’t that good anyway pff grades weird just business”.  It’s just weird to me, people’s position switches based on if he’s the team or not.
The Seahawks defense was atrocious last year. You don’t get rid of the “good” players lol.
Well John and Pete better make him great, it’s the risk they took like I said
He was one of the best players on your defense last year
Yes, all of Seattle loved Uncle Will -- but none of us were happy about his contract. Jordan Brooks on the other hand puts up numbers similar to Bobby.. and having them together on the same team is high production and league leading tackles.   https://www.nfl.com/stats/player-stats/category/tackles/2021/reg/all/defensivecombinetackles/desc   https://www.nfl.com/stats/player-stats/category/tackles/2022/reg/all/defensivecombinetackles/desc  As for Jamal, yeah sure.. that one is easy to pick on. But most of Seattle considers that a forgone conclusion at this point. They made the pick and it was a horrible one. Why they keep him now is beyond me, but we still have dead money numbers that differ between now and June so maybe they aren't done with the decisio.
I think I'll trust Pete carroll on his dB assessment and say that love, Diggs, and jamal are better than neal
If we comparing him to our other players, he is on the lower tier of good. So you do get rid of good players when you need to. Frankly the market shows when he only got veteran min but keep yapping
He’s a good, versatile player. Nothing more. He doesn’t make game changing plays and he’s not very good on the ball. Lawrence, Leonard, Jackson, McKinney, they’re all more impactful players when healthy lol. Looking at raw stats won’t tell you much unless you actually watch the giants games
A lot of really fucking fast guys just don't pan out in the NFL. Idk if it was a mental thing in Austin's case, or something else, but he did have a few big plays/games
He was 5’8” and maybe 190 LBs and had poor hands and poor route running.   He may have been better if he went to a more creative playcaller but then again he hasn’t struck me as being the ultra motivated/competitive type.
I mean 9 years in the NFL isn't really a failure even for NFL standards.   As far as just his stats though that comes down to a lot of outside factors as well like play calling, team talent that makes it possible for him to get the ball, coaching... and then stuff that has to do with him, learning the playbook, growing a bigger route tree, injuries, etc.
Who knows what kind of career he would’ve had if another team drafted him but playing for those Jeff Fisher offenses didn’t help.   Offensive coordinators during his time there were Brian Schottenheimer, Frank Cignetti, and Rob Boras lol.  Actually had one decent season in 2015 and fooled the Rams into giving him a second contract.
Dawg, please please if you don’t know him, Dri Archer. Check his stats and highlights from college.  Not to steal your word, but absurd.  So many players just don’t translate to the NFL. Durability, mental awareness, ability to study tape.  These are things that are wayyyyy less important/accentuated in college ball.
He was just fast. Wasn't a good route runner. Wasn't big enough to be a contested catch receiver. He was also a first-round pick and had the expectation that he was some sort of outstanding football player that was just waiting to be unlocked.
He played for 9 seasons and earned $40 million. That's more successful than like 99% of the dudes who entered the league.   To answer your question: small fast dudes really need to be in the perfect situation to become superstars. He was never gonna out muscle anyone so he needed someone to scheme him into space. Never had a decent QB or coach to help him out.
Because he was a one trick pony with suspect hands. He’s also just one example among many that proves you need more than speed to succeed in the NFL.
He had 10 touchdowns in one season in a variety of ways. He got a big contract and that was the end of that. Didn’t help that he played for fisher whose playbook was from the 70s. Don’t feel bad for Austin thought he got paid
In college you can be great if you're able to outrun everyone else on the field. Doesn't work that way in the pros, since most of the guys covering you are also physical freaks. You have to be a complete package in the NFL to really succeed. Tavon wasn't a good route runner, his hands weren't great, he couldn't out-muscle guys at the catch point, etc.
Probably because Geno didn't write him back after college...
I'm pretty sure in most/all those big plays in his college highlights, he was either wide open or caught the ball when Geno pitched it forward for about 1-2 yards and then generated very good YAC  In NFL, he was exposed as a small guy with bad hands and bad route running.  It also hurt that he had a HC that lacked any imagination on offense.
Jeff fisher
He was a terrific athlete and a terrible football player. Don't buy the narrative that he wasn't used correctly. Even McVay didn't find a role for him and phased him out of the offense.  He wasn't a good route runner and didn't have the hands you want to see on a stud WR. His ball-security wasn't great. A better player who profiled the same during that period was TY Hilton.
I'm sorry but the dude made like 42 mil being bad at his job. That's success in my book.  Still remember when the Rams extended him. Such a head scratcher.
NFL execs thought he was the next Percy Harvin III special teams/ slot wr type player and he got drafted to a team who had no idea how to utilize his skillset
His first couple years with the Rams were good to  decent when you consider that he also was their return man. Not worth the #8 overall of course but he wasn't a "bad" player
Jeff Fisher
He still has the best college highlight tape ever in my opinion
I think it really comes down to how he was used and the time he came into the league. He went to a Jeff Fisher led Rams team in 2013. Imagine his athleticism and speed with, say, today's 49ers in Shanahans schemes.   Yeah he needed to develop his route running and catching but he at the very least could do well as a true deebo backup in terms of versatility.   Another example from WVU is Pat White. Put him in the league now and his career would probably be vastly different. Come in to the league as a super athletic ball carrier with great vision and a raw passing ability (just like Lamar) and he does much better then be a wildcat formation sub in
He wasn't like a bust or anything. He could put up 1k all purpose yards if he stayed healthy. Definitely drafted too high, but not a bust.   He was undersized and had two leg injuries in his first two seasons.   https://www.mockdraftable.com/player/tavon-austin   He had absolute elite agility scoring in the 98th percentile in 10 yard split and 93rd percentile in 20 yard shuttle.   For a player that small you've gotta scheme ways to get the ball in their hands. It's not like he would win a bunch of 1 on 1s against a cornerback.   IMO, it's mostly due to his size why he didn't translate to the NFL.
In the early mock drafts, Austin was regarded as a third round guy. And if that's where he was selected, I think we would probably be saying he was a really good pick.  But he blew the combine to pieces and got overdrafted at 8th overall.
Always seemed like he was in his head, trying to make a huge play every time he touched the ball. Too many drops, had a tough time separating, and wasn’t faster than all the other NFL players.
Might have been a little before his time, too, and in the wrong scheme. Small fast wideouts are really important now, but it wasn't always that way. If he was drafted in 2018 by the Chiefs instead of 2013 by the Jeff Fisher Rams, imagine the impact.
If he had played every game against the Colts he would have been a hall of famer. He single handedly beat us twice.
I see a lot of people talk about route running and hands so on and so forth which is a part of it for sure. But there are bad route runners who succeed and people with bad hands who succeed as well.  Tavon and a lot of collegiate speed demons esp. those who run track have a issue of strength. In college you can get by on your speed alone, not everyone is out there running 4.40/4.60. In the NFL it's a bit different. For the most part DB's are all running at least 4.65 so the speed difference isn't as pronounced. What DB's do to try to mitigate the difference in speed is to be really physical. Get a hand on them, jam them. The reason you see a lot of "hand fighting" in the NFL is because it's a great way to slow people down. People who thrive at Tavon's physical dimensions are rare. One great example of someone who succeeded was Steve Smith Sr. Because he was a speed demon while being crazy strong. Route Running, Hands, High Pointing all those things help. But you truly have to be a crazy level athlete to compete in the NFL, because at that point everyone is talented and nearly everyone is at their peak physically. Having a natural disadvantage because of your frame. You have to make it up with being elite at other things.  Edit: When you hear commentators say "get him in space" this is what their talking about. Get him to a spot where he's not getting hands put on him. That's why Tavon was good at things like Kick/Punt Return and reverse handoffs because he had an opportunity to run in clean air.
He didn't love football enough
I think we've gotten to the point where most people are aware that the most important aspect of a WR is their route running and how much separation they can create with it.
A lot of the "really fast guys" fail at one thing...running routes.  Want him to run a go route or Hail Mary?  He's your guy.  Want him to run a play with more intricate cuts or something?  You might want a guy who ran a 4.5 or 4.6 40
The speed of the NFL is a helluva thing
To be a good WR you need to be very skilled. Speed is a great asset but the vast majority of guys aren’t simply running away from some of the best athletes in the world every snap. You need to have something else in your bag to beat NFL corners and Austin didn’t have much.
Those small fast guys never really seem to translate to the NFL because everyone is just much better and much faster in the pros.   Most don’t adapt to actually become a proper WR so just get used as a returner and on gadget plays.
Short, really fast guys don't usually do well at the receiver position at this level. Everyone's fast, so unless your Tyreek, Waddle, Hardman levels of fast it's hard to run by people the way you could in college, so this like route running, contested catching and awareness matter way more.   Austin also played for the Jets to start his career, so that was no help.   That being said, the WVU Tavon Austin highlight tape set to Hell and Back by Kid Ink is a top 5 highlight tape ever.
I think it's just a good example of how good the best players in the NFL are. He still had a decently long career and made plenty of money. He just never became the best at his position.  For every Justin Jefferson there's 4-5 Denzel mims
Because you touch yourself at night
He played a lot longer than the average player but he also wasn’t big enough to play regular wide receiver and wasn’t that good of a deep threat either. I’ll never forget the colts game where he eviscerated them though.
He was small
Very similar situation to Reggie Bush. Two transcendent athletes that had amazing highlight tapes in college. However, they both primarily relied on east/west movement rather than north/south cuts. In college they could simply outrun everyone. In the pros, they couldn't, and their inability to just turn up field really hurt them. Also, in Austin's case, he just isn't a very good receiver outside of his YAC ability.
Like most WRs who are athletic and never really translate to the NFL, the answer is route running.
He played a lot of years though.
This happens every year. So many people dominate high school and college and don’t do Jack in the pros. It’s just a much higher level of play. Everyone is a stud. The schemes are hard to learn. Not to mention fame and money will break people
Long story short: he was a gadget player at WVU, he never learned how to play the receiver position.
He never really felt like an actual WR as opposed to a gimmick that was quick and fast
I always hated how zoomed in his high school tape is
he was a decent enough gadget player for the cowboys
Also see: Laquon Treadwell
Some guys just can’t play at the next level. It happens all the time. Particularly guys that rely on athleticism like Tavon Austin and John Ross.
Small
Jeff Fischer
He was athletic but lacked the polish to be an effective WR.  It just never mattered in HS or the Big 12 (where defense is optional) but the NFL is a different animal.  His ball skills were abysmal and he wasn’t fast enough to just out athlete everyone so he was kinda screwed from the jump.
You can look at it as being born a couple of years too early (imagine him on the Shanahan 49ers or Sirianni Eagles) or simply going to the wrong team (Jeff Fisher's Rams weren't gonna do anything much more interesting than a smashmouth offense but Andy Reid's Chiefs or Bruce Arians' Cardinals may have found an interesting role he could succeed in).
He was a runningback hybrid (Percy/Samual) but no one adapted his game when he came out nor did they play to his strengths. Would have had to been paired with an Andy Reid type
He went backwards and sideways really fast, not so much moving forward though.
See John Ross and Andy Isabella
It's about what you do with your speed more than actual straight line speed. Speed is very nice but if you run a 4.6 forty time and have excellent agility and route running skill, you're still likely going to be an elite receiver. See Adams compared to a burners receiver.
Outside of Chris Johnson, the top 10 40 yard runners ever list is looking terrible given they were also all drafted high for running so fast. It's funny how much stock teams still put in ridiculously fast 40s
He was much more than speed.
As the pool of talent narrows the gap between really fast and a normal player shrinks. You have to bring more than speed. Look at someone like Tyreek.   Sure his speed is his calling card but he’s a lot more. He’s a great contested ball catcher, especially given his size. On top of that, while he’s no where near the best in the league he is still a solid route runner. Highlighted by his quick cuts to get separation on those deep ins.
Tyreek Hill is a massive outlier when it comes to these types of players, and most guys this size have the track speed but not the hands or ball tracking to actually be a good receiver
He was tiny, poor hands, and poor route running like you said.   A play caller may have helped, but he also got a 7 on the wonderlic. Not that it’s a be all end all, and maybe he phoned it in, but I’m pretty sure you get 4-5 points for signing your name
He was smaller then 5’8. I saw him at the NCAA tournament right after they announced the move. He’s legit like 5’6. How he played in the NFL is insane
What have you seen/read that struck you that way?
Came to say this, he had a solid career. So many more players bust drafted in the first round. People expect too much for these guys
9 years isn't a failure. It's a decent career. If you stick around for 5+ Years as a starter you can't be a bust.
He’s only a bust because of his draft position, if he was drafted like 30th overall he would not be that big of a bust
But Jeff Fisher is fucking sick of going 7-9!
Man, rob boras (bore us) is a name I could have gone longer without having to remember.
I went 56-5 in 5 seasons of dynasty with Kent state running the OSU spread. I had dri as a hybrid, I’d give him 12 carries a game, then I’d sub him at reciever, get him the ball on bubbles. Would go for 12 for 70 on the ground with a TD with 5 catches for 65 yards. Or I’d run him 16 times for 135 and 3 TD.   Or I’d run the hoss 20 times for 175 and 3 TD. None of my friends could beat me regularly with this combo
He probably should have bulked up and played RB. He was good with the ball in his hands, but he had no business running routes.
100%… Imagine if he landed in Philly that year. Him, Shady, and DeSean Jackson with prime Riley Cooper would’ve been insane
Was pretty telling it was over last year when he didnt make the roster on a team that later signed Cole Beasley and John Brown off the street mid season.
He had good overall athleticism, was plenty quick. It was just that he couldn't play WR due to his lack of skills, which is kind of a big deal.
His ability to cut/change direction was next level. I definitely think he was comparable to Percy Hardin he just wasn’t in as good situations
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back, Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan This is Stan
I still give that to Reggie Bush. Some of his runs are just legendary, jaw dropping, non-human. I don’t get that same vibe from Austins though his is obviously amazing too.
Not an opinion, its a fact
I'm a *huge* WVU fan and I fucking adore(d) Pat White, but while his play style was very similar to Lamar's overall playstyle, Lamar is a *much* better raw athlete than Pat and Lamar's throwing mechanics are much better than Pat's were.  Not even really a biased Ravens fan, either, as I'm way the fuck over Lamar's shit.
Andy Isabella was way overdrafted.    The dude was a tiny bodycatcher lol
Don’t forget Madden ultimate team legend Dri Archer. 60 overall with a 97 speed lol
Austin was better than those guys
I actually thought Ross was a pretty good wr. Izzy not so much, little baby Dino arms.
Henry Ruggs was kinda headed there too I thought
Didn’t Ross tweak his hammy during the combine?
Keenan Allen is slow as molasses but he is going to pick up 3rd and 7 every single time no matter what.
Ask Bengal Fans, Peter Warrick is/was a Florida State Legend and never lived up to his NFL hype. I was a big fan back in the day
I’m pretty happy with Tariq Woolen so far.
Back in the day of hand times, good ol' Randy Moss was hand-timed at 4.25 and Bo Jackson allegedly ran a 4.18 and those are 2 guys who I can buy doing that type of shit. Especially Bo.
Rondel Menendez looked good as a Punt Returner until he tore his meniscus
is that a list for the combine, because that would leave Tyreek off the list and he def wouldve been top 10
I agree with what you said about the gap between players shrinking but Tyreek is on another level when it comes to his cuts. He seriously loses no speed when he cuts and might be the best ever at it.
One thing that you missed here is his ability to run with the ball in-hand. There are fast receivers who can do all the things Tyreek does, until they have the ball. Then it's run fast until tackled.  Tackling Tyreek wouldn't be fun even if he was just average-NFL-player quick. He's good at converting speed to power and leveraging his positioning to create bad angles for defenders. So on top of all that stuff, he's a major RAC threat, even if you bottle him up.
I just looked through the lowest test scores and apparently 10 or above is considered *literate*. And anything lower is considered illiterate. Vince young and Frank Gore both scored 6. That is insane
Look at Mr Rich over here with his Rich hands covered in gold and diamonds!
I doubt a better playcaller would have helped seeing how when he got McVay he didn’t use him at all  You could argue part of the issue with Fisher was constantly trying to force him to make him work in some way honestly
He measured 5’8” at the combine. He was 5’8”.
He didn’t get better.
>People expect too much for these guys  You're not entirely wrong, but I won't blame a Rams fan for being a bit disappointed taking a WR with the 8th overall pick and never seeing him be anything close to a top 20 player at his position.  And I don't think the FO that took Austin with the 8th pick told themselves, "well, he was never really a difference maker for us, but hey, he wasn't John Ross, so we'll take it"
I mean he was a top 10 pick. The fact that he only had one season with over 900 scrimmage yards is disappointing.  Just because there were people who flamed out harder doesn't change that.
He was solid, but for a top ten pick you don’t want just solid
tell that to the very small percentage of "Eagles fans" that called Wentz a bust as early as 2/5/2018 lol.  but yeah this from the NCAAs website is kinda funny: "No. 1 overall draft picks haven't had the longest NFL careers, on average. Not even close. In fact, that No. 1 overall draft slot ranks ninth in terms of average career length at 69.8 regular season games played, or just over four 17-game NFL regular seasons' worth of games. The 13th pick in the draft has appeared in the most games in the last 10 years, with 76.8 games played on average."  Austin has played in 113 games
Looking at the same draft, Luke Joeckel went #2 and was still a starter five years into his career. But there’s no way that dude wasn’t a bust.
He was the 8th overall pick and only had 500+ receiving yards once in his career (and it was 509 yards on 101 targets). I don't know know how you can call that anything but a draft bust.
>Rob Boras  Now that's a name I haven't heard in a long time.
Prime Riley Cooper
Yeah he was done. Barely played the year or two before as well.
Percy has no mercy
Still can’t believe we took him over DK 💀
Yeah even at the time everyone was like “someone take the crack pipe out of Steve Keim’s hands”.   This is not at all comparable to Ross or Austin who were more legit as prospects.
Going into that draft I was convinced Parris Campbell, Andy Isabella, and Hakeem Butler were all going to be top NFL WRs. I’m very happy I am not an NFL GM
I mean, that can also describe Tyreek Hill.
Mr Body Catcher
As much as it was stupid in hindsight, he was considered an amazing pick at the time. Everyone had him higher than McLaurin and Diontae. DK was more talented but had big question marks. He didn’t pan out, but in the moment it was not a stupid choice by the Cardinals
I used to sign him in Franchise exclusively to run jet sweeps
Having a 9.0 YPR in college is insane
In my current franchise  mode in madden in the year of our lord 2034, I drafted a WR with 98 speed, he was 76 overall as a rookie.  I've never drafted a WR with that speed.  Catches everything and jet sweeps are auto touchdowns
Ross' problems were...  1) He kept getting injured.  2) He was drafted at the time when Andy Dalton was clearly regressing.  3) Marvin Lewis couldn't scheme/mis-used him.  I think Ross couldve been good with a better HC. He did show flashes in that Seahawks and 49ers game in 2019
His rookie year was slow, he was mostly a deep threat decoy. But his 2nd year he basically doubled his per game yardage and TD rate. Was looking much better until the arrest
Mr Binge Consumer
True and true
Yea my bad he's been great. Especially considering his draft spot. I'm more referencing the guys that got overvalued due to their combine scores
Ehhh hand timing is terribly inaccurate. I used to run track and there was always a massive difference in times between hand timed at practice and the laser timing at meets. I believe there's a +/- 0.2 second difference which is pretty substantial for short sprints like this
Frank Gore is the perfect example of "Football IQ" not necessarily correlating with actual IQ. Part of the reason he was able to be successful for so long with a busted body is because he had a natural understanding of the game, whether that be pass protection or finding the gap to pick up those extra yards.
To be fair Gore is dyslexic. So he genuinely does struggle to read.  Not sure how Young did that bad though.
Frank Gore be like “Me no need read. Me take ball and go forward 4 yard.” “What about 3 yards, Frank? Or 30? Or more?” “No. 4.”
“He didn’t get better”  Yet, every year until 2016 when his career was derailed by injuries, his stats improved.  https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/A/AustTa00.htm
Rams have learned a lot over the years. Take small speedy bust WRs in the second round now.
113 games? That's pretty impressive.  I know it's not an excellent career but logging that many shows one isn't a bust imo.
>No. 1 overall draft slot ranks ninth in terms of average career length at 69.8 regular season games played  This has to be a sample size that goes way back into old eras, because there's only 4 #1 picks in the past 30 years that have played fewer games than that (Jamarcus Russell, Kijana Carter, Tim Couch, Courtney Brown) and aside from Russell they all just barely miss the cut while there's plenty of guys in that same span with 150+ games played.  Edit - from 1984-2013 (stopped there because everyone more recent is still playing), the #1 pick averaged 147 games played.
Interesting stat about the 13th overall pick
There is a huge range been all pro and bust. Austin was a contributor on teams for nine years. That's not a bust.
Ryan Leaf played two good games and destroyed his career with drugs and a bad attitude. Jamarcus Russel did zero work to be successful in the NFL.   Tavon was drafted too high but still had a long career as a slot/backup. See the difference?
His first 4 years in the league he averaged 1,080 all purpose yards and 5.75 touchdowns per season.   If you only look at what he did catching the ball, you might come to that conclusion.
Part of it was he was just drafted too high. He probably should have been late 1st to mid 2nd and then his performance would be more in line with what was expected.
It was short and n-bomb filled
And McLaurin. And Diontae Johnson.
For some reason everyone was shitting on DK after his combine, saying he had the tools but not the talent.  I don't know why though, he was an absolute steal in the 2nd round.
His sophomore-senior seasons he averaged 77 catches 1170 yards 10 TDs a year, and although playing in a subpar conference he absolutely lit up Georgia’s elite defense for 15 catches 212 yards and 2 TDs. Then he ran a 4.31 40 yard dash. He wasn’t any more over drafted than every other elite speed guy.
That’s some revisionist history. Isabella was viewed as a great prospect at the time  Edit: USAToday gave the pick an A-, Sports Illustrated gave the pick a B+, and he sat at #30 overall on the PFF draft board.  He was considered a great prospect with tons up upside, nobody was asking what Keim was smoking.
Yeah but the Chiefs took Tyreek in the 5th round instead of the 2nd round, and Tyreek's outperformed Andy Isabella in everything at the combine (shuttle, 40-yard dash, three-cone drill, vertical jump, etc)
Mr. Bad Choice
This comment has forever changed how I will listen to "Knife Talk" by Drake and 21 Savage. I don't think I can ever hear the "Mr. Body Catcher" line again without thinking of MBC.
slaughter gang soul snatcher
A lot of people were predicting DK to be a huge bust.
People were all over the place with him   https://www.nfl.com/prospects/andy-isabella/32004953-4156-2722-bf26-62181351a224    I hated the pick from day 1, his senior bowl performance sucked
Found Kellen Moore’s Reddit account.
I'd argue that 2 isn't accurate. He was drafted at the time when the Bengals O-line fell apart. Andy didn't have any time to throw the ball after they let Whit and Zeitler walk.   The result is the same, though.
He couldn’t catch and put zero effort into learning the offense as well.
No idea if he was like this ih college but in the pros, he had bad drop problems.   Out of 141 targets, he was credited with 17 drops.
Ross’ number 2 problem was that he couldn’t catch.  He had drop issues all through college and it was a known problem.  Dude never should have been a first round pick… let alone top 10
Someone like... Andy Reid?
Yeah I distinctly remember him being off to a great start the year of his arrest and it was looking like he was legitimately breaking out. Then he killed.
dude had blazing speed his 2 year
After the arrest, his numbers really dropped. I wonder if that has something to do with it
Haha I know, I was just being cheeky. Your point stands.
Oh yeah I'm aware, when I played in high school we had a laser setup on our campus (extremely expensive boarding school). Just with those two players who were already known for being absurd athletes I feel like it's worth mentioning. I mean, they're possibly the two most freakishly athletic players the NFL has ever seen.
For sure. One of my best friends is probably the dumbest guy I know. Only 6’1, not athletic, not a sharpshooter, but he still made it to D1 basketball because he’s a literal genius in the sport. Intelligence (or lack thereof) doesn’t always translate to sports
If you ever saw [his leaked Wonderlic](https://i.imgur.com/YHajXEs.png) it’s surprising he actually got 6 points out of it.
Did they? All I see is that he got more touches but his Y/C and catch % dropped after his rookie year.   Looks more like the Rams tried to force him the ball because of his draft position but they eventually realized that he wasn’t going to be worth a long term deal.
I was scrolling through this thread and all I thought to my self was "please don't mention Tutu, please don't mention Tutu".
Ernie Davis was #1 overall and tragically never played a game so there are definitely going to be outliers that skew the numbers.
You don't spend the 8th overall pick hoping to get a "contributor". I recognize he carved out a nice little career for himself, but he is a tried and true draft bust.
He has 600 receiving yards total in the back half of his career lol half the reason he was on rosters at that point was because he was a former top 10 pick. You're mixing up him being an elite football player compared to the average dude with him being compared to his peers
I’d argue they’re both busts but leaf is a colossal bust. When you draft a wr top 10 I’m expecting a guy who can push for 1000 yds a year. Had he been a 3rd or later round pick I’d be okay with the production he gave. Expectations for a 1st round pick are high for a reason they’re picked before other people. Tavon had a good career as a 3-4 wr on a team but his draft position merited high expectations. Both can be true
Just because someone else was a bigger bust doesn't mean no one else can be a bust, that's some crazy logic right there. Spending a top 10 pick to only get over 500 yards once is a bust.
If you have to include punt return yardage to get the 8th overall pick who was force fed touches past 1,000 yards (his best yards from scrimmage season was 907) I can't really see how you'd call him anything but a bust.   The fact that the Rams gave him a big 2nd contract is still nuts to me.
I'm sorry, but [these are not the career stats](https://i.imgur.com/bQYLyNh.jpg) of someone you want to draft in the late 1st-mid 2nd rounds.
And N’Keel Harry!  Wait.
It was because everyone bought into the whole thing about his terrible agility scores. Turns out if you are that big and fast, it doesn't matter.
If you play Madden, you know to pick the best athletes over the best players in a draft. Because Madden is fucking garbage.
lack of production in college and a terrible 3 cone time
Imagine lighting up Georgia’s elite defense after they bench their starting CB lol
>Daniel Jeremiah on The MTS Podcast: "Andy Isabella was my 188th player in this draft and went with the 62nd pick, he went to the senior bowl, couldn't catch anything, couldn't get out of a break, Penny Hart was better than him and he went undrafted."
Tyreek was taken in the fifth because he got kicked off every college team he was on.
Tyreek wasn't invited to the combine
Tyreek is also thick as hell for a tiny player
If you go back and watch his college highlights, he always catches with his body. He never extends his hands to make a catch. Hindsight is 20/20, I thought he was going to be a stud in the NFL.
UW alumni, I skeptical of Ross because he dominated subpar competition. Then when UW faced Alabama he disappeared. I knew after that game he wasn’t going to work out in the NFL.
I also remember he was a legit guy to trade for in Franchise. X factor potential, had fun playing him for a week or two once I figured that out. Then...
There are a lot of different types of intelligence. How’s the saying go? If you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree it will live its whole life thinking it’s an idiot” or something like that
Damn so he IS literate. Revise that score to a 50 ASAP.
>Looks more like the Rams tried to force him the ball because of his draft position but they eventually realized that he wasn’t going to be worth a long term deal.  Well, kinda. The Rams force feeding him led to them tricking themselves into giving him a long term deal.
Yeah the 1st ever NFL draft pick never played in the NFL because of contract disagreements
No, not really. He was one of those middle ground, below average picks that the internet wants to exaggerate because just saying 'he was okay but didn't meet expectations' is too boring.
He earned a $40M second contract. Dude never lived up to expectations but he's not the bust y'all are making him out to be.
He is definitely a bust but one overlooked stat is he at least has 29 total touchdowns for his career which isn't horrible but you definitely want more out of a top ten pick.
A bust is a player that just didn’t make it in the NFL. A player that made it for 9 years, proved he belonged in the NFL but didn’t perform to expectations isn’t a bust. The word bust implies something completely broken.
Bust implies a player was worthless. Idk if at this point its semantics or whatever but Tayvon wasn't useless. Busts get cut early on.
Yeah he was over drafted, but he didn't bust.   People throw that term around for any first rounder who isn't a perennial pro bowler.
Baker played a lot of that game and even without him individually out there Georgia was still an elite SEC team and top 10 defense allowing only 175 passing yards a game that year playing against a lot of teams better than UMass and yet Isabella was able to catch 15 of 16 targets for 212 yards against them that’s still a difficult matchup especially for a small school.  He was also a semi-finalist for best WR in the country award and was PFF’s highest rated WR in the country, but yeah he was always a bad prospect no hindsight whatsoever you’re just smarter than all the NFL guys.
Penny Hart didn’t turn out to be better then Andy Isabella funnily enough
so you found 1 example to counter his several examples?
as well ad kicking woman and kids too
he was only kicked off 1 of his college teams, he fell to the 5th because of his DV
Saying he was ok is almost an overstatement. He really only contributed a good amount like 2 years in his career and they were not that good. I don't get why we are quibbling with semantics here though the point is clear. From a draft and college production standpoint an extraordinary amount more was expected
That was a stupid and terrible contract.
Yeah a contract that got restructured after 2 years, after which they dumped him for a 6th lol. Also giving him top 5 WR money for having a mediocre season is stupid to begin with    It's not that his 9 years in the league validates picking him 8th overall, he got all those chances and money from coasting off being a former top 10 pick
Nah your definition makes no sense. Would every 7th round pick that doesn't make it be a bust?  A bust is someone who was drafted very highly who never lived up to expectations. Tavon Austin is a certified bust. If you want the charges to trade up to 8 and draft someone who will get them 500 yards once then just say that.  We need to implement the "Clowney Line" for busts. If you fall under JD Clowney then you're a bust.
Bro Kevin White has been in the NFL for 7 seasons. He was drafted 7th overall and has 397 career receiving yards. He made it in the NFL. Is he a bust? Do you not know what a bust is?
Bust implies he severely underperformed relative to expectations. He was a draft bust.
He was pretty damn bad. I don’t really understand why the Rams rostering and extending a bad player makes him not a bust.
The dude wasn't even a mediocre starter except as a punt returner. It's looney to me to say he isn't a draft bust. He had one okay season in 2015 (where he still sucked as a WR, but was a good gadget guy), and that's it for being a real contributor to the team.
He was bad though, like just not a good player to have in your offense. He had a year where he was targeted 106 times and averaged 4.8 yards per passing target. That’s off the charts bad, it will kill a passing offense.
Ah yes because USA Today is definitely worth as much as Daniel Jeremiah’s input. Great example
you are mixing up Tyreek with Kareem, Tyreek choked his woman Kareem was the kicker
I feel like people overcorrect and act like you have to have an epic insane flameout to be a bust. Dude was a top 10 pick and was returning punts just so they could justify him being on the team  If you're a GM and your track record for top 10 picks is "uh well he's on a roster" nobody is gonna say "wellll getting on a roster is hard, here's an extension", your ass is on the street lol
Many people on Reddit for some reason want to redefine the word "bust". It's always meant under performing your draft position. They act like a guy having a 9 year career makes it somehow not a terrible pick or makes him not a draft bust. He was a mediocre WR2 at best.
It’s crazy to me that people think a player with a 9 year career is a bust.   Manziel level players are what an actual bust is.
That’s a function of how they got him the ball.   He didn’t run 15 yard curl routes. He ran swing routes behind the LOS. They were essentially run plays.
Are you actually saying Tavon Austin came close to performing like you'd expect an 8th overall pick to perform?
>That’s a function of how they got him the ball.  They got him the ball that way because of his limitations. He was a bad route runner and had bad hands.   >He didn’t run 15 yard curl routes.  Because he couldn’t.
He sure as hell did a lot better than the two guys drafted after him at 8th overall. Vic Beasley and Justin Gilbert.   The latter of which is definitely a bust and neither had 9 year careers.
Yeah it’s called a scheme. It would be pretty fucking dumb to have a 5’8” guy trying to win 1 on 1s against corners 4 inches taller.   They got him the ball in open space and tried to let him make plays.
This hit me right in the nostalgia. LOVED Quentin Jammer. Him and Cromartie at the corners were a great duo.
The greatest corner name of all time.
Not so well known fact, his brother is 3x Pro Bowl safety Quandre Diggs
I believe Jammer is one of the reasons UT got put back on the map for kids out of high school wanting to go the school. He very much helped establish a tone at the University that would continue on for years. Those were some good days.
Was just thinking about this dude randomly last night at the grocery store.  Jammer?  I hardly know her!
Thanks for this
Quentin jammer is the type of cb i thought we were getting with j.c. jackson.
He also starred in an episode of sports science.
I loved this and hope you do more to help all of us entertained this offseason with these posts.
Diehard Bolts fan here. ⚡️ Thanks for shouting out Quentin Jammer. He’s of my favorite Chargers of all time. A physical corner and a great tackler who was super reliable only missed 2 games after his rookie season, also started in all games but one. Miss Jammer and Cromartie playing together!
Jammer was a bad mf and pretty sure started DBU at Texas
Whoa dude, are you me?! I literally went on a deep dive through Quentin Jammer's Wiki two days ago (former San Diego Chargers fan here) - loved all the reminders. Jammer was solid, not worth the top 5 pick but I do love how solid he was as CB for the Chargers.
Jammer is a player that would have been in the top ten corners in the league conversation while he was playing if he had been drafted 5-10 years earlier. Unfortunately, he was a physical press-man corner with mid speed and agility in an era of transition towards favoring the passing game above all else in the nfl, and his style of play became defunct without having the athleticism to stick with receivers without putting his hands on them all the way down the field.
It's crazy some names you don't think about for years and years but had a big impact.
Well Jammie Robinson is in this draft so we can just manifest that
One of the names that stuck out to me when I first started getting into football. I thought it was cool as hell that his name was Jammer and that's what he does for a living, jam people up
They sure don't make em like they used to
Cornerstone of most of my Madden 08 teams (contract year so he was easy to trade for).
The Lions picked third in the draft in 2002 and I wanted Quentin Jammer. Unfortunately, we took Joey Harrington instead. Years later we drafted his much younger brother, Quandre Diggs but unfortunately, the team managed to ruin that too.
First ballot, hall of fame football name.
I think he went to school at UT with Nathan Vasher as well. Another badass name. Those were the days :3  Also a fun fact: Quandre Diggs is Jammer's half brother
That's strange. I just mentioned him and how he couldn't catch.
This was fuckin awesome man. Jammer was always a guy I had in fantasy drafts in madden back in the day. I had Peanut (Tillman) and Jam(mer) as my DBs nearly every year.  Speaking of hall of very good, I’d love to see you do one of these on Charles Tillman! We hear about the peanut punch all the time but I don’t think people really know just how great of a cornerback he really was
I'm glad it hit you where it needed to.   I loved them too!
> Cromartie  Man, if that dude doesn't wind up with at least one kid in the NFL I will be stunned.
One of the goat names of the era, and all time along with D'Brickashaw Ferguson.
Kenny Pickett should have switched to DB. It just would have been right
Steve Interception would like a word
Jammer? Yes. Unless someone has the last name of incomplete or something lol
NFL Street legend Carl Cover
Buster Skrine
I remember this dude solely from playing the NFL2k series a ton. He was a beast in that in part to his size.
I would have never guessed this (they're half brothers).
Helped make it DBU before the downfall, lots of really good Dbs were coming out of there. Michael Huff, Griffin, Vasher, Aaron Williams, Earl, Aaron Ross, Vacarro. Fizzled out ofc when the entire team started its downturn though.
*Ba dummmmm tsss*
No problem.
Oddly enough, when I did these posts last year a fellow redditor who was also a cowboys fan AND also shared a potato username commented all the time on my post.
Good cb duo for yall! Glad you liked it.
Did Texas have that many good DBs?
Hahaha I do the same shit. Just go and look at random player wiki pages.
Well said. Thank you for the comment
In 300 years every football player will have their lineages trace back to either Antonio Cromartie or Philip Rivers.
https://www.instagram.com/antoniocromartiejr31/?hl=en  AC jr is a high school DB currently 👀
Blockinson would like to have a word.
Dude was the inspiration for Key & Peele’s All-Star sketch.
Cletidus Hunt
It really was a golden era for the university. They had true dual athletes competing in football/track/basketball. Why the university found a way to fuck that up blows my mind.
A few years back yeah. Here’s a good read: https://www.burntorangenation.com/platform/amp/football/2016/4/25/11504938/dbu-texas-longhorns-cbs-sports  But here are the names that make it true: Quentin Jammer, Earl Thomas, Michael Griffin, Michael Huff, Cedric Griffin, Tarell Brown, Aaron Ross, Aaron Williams, Kenny Vaccaro. Throw in Ahmad Brooks and Rod Babers as great college DBs. I know I’m missing some.
From like 2000 - 2013 or so at least.
Yeah, got to revisit nostalgia city from time-to-time. These players give a lot to teams we root for - I think its fun to check in on them over the years.
That San Diego lifestyle. Two guys I bet hung out a lot.
Sucks too cause they probably have another title if Colt didn’t get hurt vs Bama which kinda started their run too. Texas almost won with Freshman Garrett Gilbert playing terribly, so with Colt I think they win that game and maybe Texas continues being good while Bama doesn’t quite reach their current tier.
Nathan Vasher, Quandre Diggs.
Who's your favorite?
Yep, good call
There's so many from that Chargers era. Obviously there's LaDainian Tomlinson (superstar). But I really liked guys like Nick Hardwick, Jamal Williams, Malcolm Floyd, Drayton Florence, and Shaun Philips (in addition to Quentin) for a long time. San Diego had a bunch of solid guys on the roster from 2004-2010 (I could go on about some of those dudes: Igor Olshansky! Kris Dielman!). I think Kansas City fans will also agree that Donnie Edwards was just so great to have on a team.
Yup yup all great names. Love it
Dan Snyder’s lawyer
Are you referring to rings as silverware?
Who’s this 99 guy for the rams? Hear he may be trouble for us
Surprised there isn’t much chatter around Patrick Peterson. P2 made 8 straight Pro Bowls, was 1st-team All-Pro twice (both within the last decade), and was on the 2010’s All-Decade team.
1) Jameis Winston  2) JJ Watt  3) Aaron Donald  4) Von Miller  5) Luke Kuechly
I don’t know who was the best   What I do know is that Kam Chancellor was terrifying in the Super Bowl in 2013. That Seahawks defense was so physical and just imposed their will on my Broncos. And I’ll always think Kam embodied that more than anyone else on their defense   That was the best offense in league history and he just beat them into the ground
Not as splashy as most of the players mentioned, but Harrison Smith has played at nearly a HoF level for 10+ years.
1. Aaron Donald   2. JJ Watt  3. Von Miller  4. Bobby Wagner   5. Luke Kuechly
For people's reference here is the All-Decade Team for the 2010s, which should stimulate some thinking  DEFENSIVE END  * Calais Campbell * Cameron Jordan * Julius Peppers * J. J. Watt  DEFENSIVE TACKLE  * Geno Atkins * Fletcher Cox * Aaron Donald * Ndamukong Suh  LINEBACKER  * Chandler Jones * Luke Kuechly * Khalil Mack * Von Miller * Bobby Wagner * Patrick Willis  CORNERBACK  * Patrick Peterson * Darrelle Revis * Richard Sherman  DEFENSIVE BACK  * Chris Harris Jr. * Tyrann Mathieu  SAFETY  * Eric Berry * Earl Thomas * Eric Weddle  It might just be because I have to watch him fuck my team up 2x a year but I think **Fletcher Cox** is a sneaky potential top 5.  4x AP / 6x PB in the last 10 years & if it weren't for AD being (IMO) by far the best defensive player over that time period sort of dominating the discussion around DT Cox would be seen as the best DT in the game during this span.  A lot of the CBs/DBs suffer from not exactly fitting into this time frame.  CHJr & Revis were better than PP, Sherman, or Mathieu but they retired quite a while ago now.  Same thing with ET3/Berry/Weddle, ET3 is better than any safety playing RN but he's been irrelevant for the last 4ish seasons
1a: JJ  1b: Donald  3: Von  4: Wagner  5: Kuechly  HM: Speedhawk
Lavonte should always be mentioned with Luke and Bobby, he's had an amazing career but has been overshadowed due to the lack of team success for much of his career.
1. Aaron Donald. 3 DPOYS, 7 All-Pros. Arguably the greatest defender ever. 2. JJ Watt. 2 DPOYS, 3 All-Pros. Had imo the greatest peak of any defender ever, but his longevity and the fact that his 1rst DPOY wasn't from the 2010's drags him down. 3. Von Miller. 1 DPOY, 3 All-Pros. Great consistency along with one of the greatest SB performances ever 4. Earl Thomas. 3 All-Pros. People forget how insane Earl was. Richard Sherman was phenominal but Thomas was the core of that group. 5. Luke Kuechly. 5 All-Pros, 1 DPOY. One of the greatest to ever play ILB. Shame he retired so soon
Earl Thomas
In my opinion  Donald is 1, Watt is 2 and I’d probably put Von at 3. I’ll put Earl Thomas at 4 and as much as it pains me Keuchly over Willis at 5
Number five goes to Lavonte David imo. He is in the same tier as Bobby Wagner
P-52!! Patrick Willis  I know he retired 9 years ago and im a homer but Patrick Willis man...7 pro bowls, 5 1st team all pros, Defensive rookie of the year..  Mike Singletary said him and Ray Lewis were the best linebackers he's ever seen.
Lavonte David belongs on this list soley for being one of the only LBs to shit down Kelce.
Probably put Matt schaub on this list let’s be honest
Bobby Wagner, Kam Chancellor, Richard Sherman, Earl Thomas, Aaron Donald
Lavonte David.  Compared to Wagner, David has more: solo tackles (949 to 900), more tackles for loss (143 to 78), more forced fumbles (27 to 6), only .5 sacks less (29 to 29.5), and only 1 fewer interception (12 to 13). Oh, and they debuted the same year and Wagner has 2 more games than David.  I'm aware that stats don't tell the whole story of any player, but Lavonte David has been by far the most overlooked stud in the NFL for years. LVD and Mike Evans were the only watchable parts of some horrifically putrid teams between 2014 and 2019, so neither of them get the acclaim they deserve.
You can tell who in this thread watched the Panthers play in the last decade.  Nothing but love for Wagner and David, either of them could easily find themselves on this list too, but stat debate is close between the 3 of them. Plus, in any case, stats only matter so much. Kuechly separated himself in IQ and it was evident on the field.   I’ve never seen anything like it, I really can’t draw a comparison to any player I’ve ever seen play defense.
Bam Bam Kam
Dylan, Dylan, Dylan, Dylan, and Dylan.
Luke kuechly better be on that list.
Obvious I’m biased, but Kuechly should be on this over Wagner.
The homer in me says Harrison Smith but he is a legit HM. I’m surprised by the lack of Ramsey. People talking about Sherm but in the last 10 years you’re probably taking Ramsey over him most those years.
Has to be Luke Kuechly
LaVonte david
TJ Watt
Donald  JJ  Von  Wagner  Kuechly
Lavonte David. Compare his stats to other linebackers in the last decade. You will be astonished.
JJ, Donald, Wagner, Von, Sherman  Shout out to Willis who was a monster in his prime, and would be easily number 3 on this list for me. But his prime was a few years before the cutoff of this thread.
Wow Von has been in the league for over ten years? 😭
Revis?
Donald has been great, but JJ Watt carried a very mediocre Texans team the playoffs two years. His 3 TD year as a defensive player should’ve had him as an overall MVP.   The gap for hits on a QB between him, and everyone else is mind blowing. Batted balls, TFLs, he just disrupted the other teams offense at such a high level.   I just think JJ was #1 the past decade and deserves to be in the conversation as greatest DL of all time.   Other guys in my top 5: Aaron Donald, Von Miller, Patrick Peterson, Lavonte David/Kuechly/ Wagner toss up
Harrison smith over any safety the last decade. He’s the only one still playing. And he’s still very good
Sherm or Kuechly (probably Kuechly). Chancellor is my favorite of the LOB but he's not top 5 defense all league with a decade span, Earl is a dark horse for 5 tho
After seeing Richard sherman try and break into his in-laws' house, I'll give him the spot out of fear.
Chandler jones should honestly be considered
Luke Kuechly
Luke was better than Wagner
1. Aaron Donald   2. JJ Watt  3. Von Miller  4. Luke Kuechly  5. Earl Thomas   The top 3 seem to be unquestioned by most of this thread. I have Kuechly over Wagner but you could argue either one. And for the fifth spot I had to have someone from the LOB. I give the nod to Thomas as he was the best deep safety in the league for a long time. Kam and Sherman were great but I think Thomas was the best player of the LOB.
1. Aaron Donald  2. Earl Thomas        3. Von Miller.       4. Bobby Wagner.       5. JJ Watt.                 Donald’s dominance is absurd, so is Watt’s peak years. Bobby has accolades and longevity over guys like Luke, Von Miller is a monster and showed out on the biggest stage, and I put Earl at the top of the LOB. Obviously, there were studs all over that defense but Pete’s scheme really needed an all-time Free Safety to play center field. Look at the ground that man could cover and the numbers with him on/off the field. When they lost him in 2016, it was like they were a totally different team.
It’s very hard for DBs to get consideration in this just because of the nature of the position so I’m not even gonna try. LBs too, for that matter  Donald Watt Von Wagner  I think Kuechly would have been my answer if he didn’t retire and we did this two years ago. Mack is probably a safe bet, the 2018 Bears defense stands out so strongly as a “signature” season for a defensive player. But honestly… hate to do this but I think my next would be Garrett. I know that gets hate in this sub because it’s the nerd answer but given how little support he’s had and how crazy good he is at the hardest shit in the sport I think he’s the best edge in the league and he basically has been since his second season
A bit of homerism but what about Cox? The most consistently dominate DL not named AD over the last decade. Granted he doesn't put up the stats but I feel has to be close to being in the conversation.
Agree..5th is the toughest one..and you haven’t even listed chandler jones, Suh, fletcher cox
The 5 most unique defenders   Donald  Watt  Wagner  Luke k  And then Von Miller    Miller more for his post season take over and high level of play.
Revie island
Stefon Gilmore????
Instant top 4:   1. JJ Watt  2. Aaron Donald  3. Von Miller  4. TJ Watt  Last one is questionable, but probably Kuechly.
I like the idea of Jason Garrett as a top 5 defensive player through offensive sabotage
1. jj  2. AD  3. Mack  4. Von  5. Luke
Earl, Sherman, Wagner, Chancellor, Avril  No but seriously those first 3 arguably belong on that list anyways lol
Kuechly over Wagner for sure
Kuechly
No Luke Kuechly is a crime
Harrison Smith deserves to be on the list. I don't care about the other four.
1.	JJ 2.	AD 3.	Revis 4.	Von 5.	Wagner
No mention of Stephon Gilmore anywhere?
Aaron Donald might be the best defensive player ever. He’s the clear #1 and as great as JJ was at times he’s not even top 2 in sacks from his draft class.  I’d still go JJ at #2  Kuechly at #3  Wagner #4  Von #5
Any list that has JJ over AD is invalid
Ramsey
AD, JJ Watt, Von, Kuechly, Sherman for me.   AD was the most dominant interior DL for 7 years straight which is remarkable. JJ Watt’s peak might be the best in recent times and he was so damn versatile as a defensive lineman. Von is the best postseason defensive player of the last 10 years, that SB 50 run was insane to witness. Kuechly was special to watch, so instinctive and was clearly a notch above every linebacker in the league for most of his career. Sherm was such a technically sound corner, he had that rare combo of being a shutdown corner with the ball skills of a (former) WR that lead to QBs not even targeting him.
Hard to argue with much of your list.   I am biased but I think Chris Jones should be added for contention. 4 pro bowls, 1 first team All-Pro (and 3x second team All-Pro), 2x SB champion. If Aaron Donald didn't exist Jones would be talked about in almost the same way as Donald is. As far as interior DL go it's basically been Donald, then Jones, and then everybody else. Chiefs dont win the SB last year without Jones. And he's had 15+ sacks in a season as a DT twice! Something not done by any DT I can think of, including Donald or other greats like Warren Sapp. Donald has been more consistent with double-digit sack totals but Donald is truly unique for the history of the NFL. Chris Jones resume at this point in his career is about as good as any DT.
You fuckers put some respect on Cam Heywards name RIGHT THE FUCK NOW.  If AD didn’t exist he would be AD.
This conversation was brought to by the NFL. Taking away defensive play so much that Bobby Wagner is considered an “elite” defensive player
Patric fucking willis.
Von Miller  Aaron Donald  Jj Watt  Luke Kuechly   After that it's very arguable (and above list is in no particular order)
What I find strange about this question now is how few safeties come to mind anymore. Insane MLB and FS/SS used to be some of the easiest picks for top defenders, but now it is pass rush almost exclusively
Sherm.
Donald, watt, bosa revis miller
Troy Apke
Gilmore was lockdown for a while
Another consideration could be Geno Atkins, 8x Pro Bowl and 2x All Pro 1st Team
Earl was better than wagner
Troy Polamalu was still playing in the last decade...
You forgot Shaq/Darius Leonard with the exception of this year he’s been one of the best linebackers since he was drafted. To put in comparison Fred Warner (since they were both in the same draft class) only has 85 more tackles because Leonard has played 20 less games than him (and Warner is considered one of the best LBs). Warner has 1 fewer pick, sack, force fumble in his career than Leonard had for his season high.  PS: I am not saying Warner is bad in any way but Leonard is just that dominant.
Chris Jones needs to be on this list
Aaron Donald, JJ Watt, Von Miller, Demarcus Ware, Kam Chancellor.
JJ Watt, Donald, Kuechly, Earl Thomas, Mack.   Honorable mentions: Justin Houston, Robert Quinn, Stephon Gilmore. Didn’t have the consistency, but at their peaks they were tremendous.
Darrell revis
Put Jalen Ramsey in that last spot. Not sure about Wagner though.
i think you guys forgot how dominant JJ was in his peak. Go watch some film and get back to me. aaron donald isint even close to JJ in his prime
TJ Watt had arguably the greatest defensive season of all time, and I believe is #1 all time in sacks per game despite playing injured last season and lowering his average a bit
Where’s Chidobe Awuzie?
But what if Donald got the Suh treatment?
1. JJ 2. Donald 3. Von 4. Mack 5. Kuechly  I think that's the definitive list in whatever order you like.
Give me JJ over Donald.  Give me Gronk over Kelce.  Donald and JJ play different positions so it’s a little harder but im going to go for the more dominant guy at his peak.  JJ for a stretch was legit the greatest defensive player of all time, and should be a league mvp.   But to round out the other 5 give me Wagner, ET, Von.  ET is the second greatest coverage safety and imo made the lob with his ridiculous range.  Allowed kam to patrol the underneath and allowed sherm to lock up one side.
Revis > Sherman  And it’s not really Jets bias he was just so beyond insane that the media had to always find someone who wasn’t nearly as good to bring him down to. Whether it was Nnamdi or Sherman.
Kuechly, watt, Donald, Gilmore, et3
Aaron Donald  J.J Watt  Richard Sherman  Jalen Ramsey  Luke Kuchely
get wagner off that list.  'insane consistency' huh?    we know who your team is don't we
I'd put James Harrison in there as the 5th if he counts
I'm a packers fan and if you not putting Nick Bosa on that list u fucking up!! Most dominate Dline men last few years!
I'm gay
Fred Warner - dudes amazing and the heart of 49ers defense
He’s not top 5 obviously but I wonder where Judon ranks, I haven’t seen him mentioned.
Ramsey flew pretty damn high for a long time, I might give it to him over Sherman
The lack of Fletcher Cox being mentioned on this list is just disrespectful.
Dont’a Hightower deserves an Honorable Mention.   1. [Why not run Beast Mode? Why throw the ball?](https://youtube.com/watch?v=vQuL09u6520&feature=share) Because Hightower stopped Beast Mode the play before. With a torn rotator cuff.   2. [It was not 28-3 when Hightower strip sacks Ryan](https://youtube.com/watch?v=x82XxhYZXzY&feature=share) but once again, Hightower has _arguably_ the second most-impactful play in a Super Bowl.   Hightower did not accumulate individual honors, making only two Pro Bowls. He was rarely thought of as the best player on his defense, let alone his team. He did not rack up impressive stats, never breaking 100 tackles and topping out with six sacks in a season.   YET, by the _if you watched him_ standard, there’s really no argument that Hightower isn’t one of the eleven most impactful and important defenders of the last decade. Games are won by players making BIG plays. Hightower single-handedly changed two Super Bowl games.  He is responsible for setting up the most dramatic Super Bowl ending, ever. He is the answer to “why not run Lynch?”   Awards are given for a reason. Patrick Willis was awesome. But stats and awards aren’t everything - big plays in big moments matter more to me. I’ll want Dont’a Hightower. He made plays that literally changed the NFL.
No Fletcher Cox?
Patrick Peterson, Ed Reed, Bob Sanders, Ray Lewis, JJ Watt
1: Jeffrey Simmons (the only hard set player here, everyone else is in no order at all)  2: JJ Watt  3: Von Miller  4: Logan Ryan   5: Aaron Donald (I lied, wherever Watt is, Donald is below him)
All of y’all are wrong for putting Wagner over Kuechly. Kuechly was the best LB of the decade hands down
The lack of Charles Woodson mentions is saddening.
JJ AD Von Kuechly Revis  Wagner  Gilmore   Probably that order
Luke keuchly > Bobby Wagner. Deal with it.
Blows my mind that Luke Kuechly gets so much notoriety but Lavonte David isn’t even mentioned.
Ed Reed falls inside the window.   64 interceptions.  11 forced fumbles  13 recovered fumbles  13 touchdowns   139 pass deflections  646 tackles as a safety  1,600 interception return yards
Troy Polamalu are you insane to not even mention him ?? Ed Reed?? Ray fu king Lewis ?? How old are you kid
Myles Garrett has entered the chat  Edit haters
I may be a homer but Kenney Clark needs to be there
Yall sleeping on max crosby
And Micah just laughing and waiting to ruin all your lists.
Wow. You down voters are hilarious.
Harrison Smith deserves a mention.
1.A.D 2.J.J 3.Von 4.Wagner 5. Sherman/Keuchly
Agree with the 4 and I’d add Myles Garrett as the 5th
Has it been a full decade since Po llama loo lined up in the C gap?
Derwin James
In my completely unbiased opinion there is a surprising lack of Harrison smith in here
Damn, no Fred Warner or nick bosas? Well the rest have been stated just had to get them in there.
I think Watt and Donald are the top 2 then you have tier below with Mack, Von, Wagner, and Keuchly maybe even TJ can be considered part of this tier
Luke Kuechly
Damiro Davis is one of the most underrated line backers in history.
Aaron Donald had a Hollywood team built up around him and was never in the running for MVP. That’s all I have to say about that. Of course the counting stats say JJ was better too, but we all know numbers lie….
Chris Jones, Chris Jones, Chris Jones, Chris Jones, and Chris Jones
No Ed Reed?
If I had to pick one last name from ur list it would be Kuechly. Bro was insane on the field for several years
He has not been there long enough but I think Shaquille Leonard might be in this conversation soon enough.
Bobby Wagner, JJ Watt, Aaron Donald, Von Miller, Luke Keuchly
Luuuuuke
Luke keuchly should be there easily.
I think Kuechly is the easy choice here
Keuchly should’ve been the best linebacker ever
TROY
Patrick Peterson? Tyrann Mathieu ? Aqib Talib
Chris Stone Cold Jones!
AD, JJ, Von, Wagner, Keuchly
Cams best season was over a decade ago
The absolute David slander
Dylan, Dylan, Dylan, Dylan, and Dylan
I’m just here to see the Luke love
Cam Jordan
Keuchly was the best field general I ever saw.
Tremaine Edmunds could be the greatest MLB of all time according to Joe Marino of Locked On Bills . It doesn’t matter if u played , coached or were a referee at the high school an college levels , according to Marino Edmunds is the greatest linebacker in Bills history. If the regular fan says anything different u don’t recognize contributions cause what he did for the Bill defense was to complex …….🤔 Tremaine Edmunds greatest safety backer ever Chicago. He is a he is built like a super hero do not fall in love with his measurables. His outlook or mental approach to defending the run Is similar to Dion Sanders . Edmunds can NOT shed a block to save humanity. Good luck Chicago u deserve better ..
Demarcus Ware was NEEDED to be game planned for by every OC for a decade +
1. Dy-lan  2. Dy-lan  3. Dy-lan  4. Dy-lan  5. Dy-lan
the idea that Donald wouldn't be one of the best if his team didn't win a Lombardi is ridiculous
I hope someone is mentioning Luke Kuechly, one of the smartest linebackers I have ever seen play.
Honestly surprised how consistent the top ~7-8 choices are.
If you are looking g at the last 10 years. Then longevity comes into play  Donald Keuchely Suh Watt Miller
I think it’s important to bring up Chandler Jones. He never got recognition while playing for us, but the dude was such a dog. I personally would put him above Wagner, Mack, Bosa, and Chancellor, but that might be my cards fan bias.
Not sure what the stats for all those guys are. But I do know we're 1-10 when TJ doesn't play. Soooo...
Silverware is forks and spoons and such
No Revis?
Keuchly
If it's not Nicholas John Bosa that's because he hasn't been around as long as these other dudes.   That said, I might give the last spot to Uncle Sherm. 🤷🏻‍♂️ You could make a good case for any of those dudes tbh
Luke Kuechly
Dylan, Dylan, Dylan, Dylan, & Dylan.
I thought of four Ravens but then realized I'm old and none were in their prime in the last ten years...
I would include Troy Polamalu over as top 3!
Revis
Garrett or Jalen Ramsey
Donald, Watt, Von, Eric Berry, Wagner
Aaron Donald, JJ Watt, Von Miller, Luke Kuechly, Chris Jones.
The fact that I was looking for Ray Lewis and realized he retired a decade ago. I’m getting old man.
Excuse me but there appears to be an Angel of Death in your C-gap,  sir.
Revis
Bosa I think needs a few more years of this type of production to warrant being on a list like this.  Most other comments have hit the main dudes I think:   Donald, Watt, Kuechly, Earl Thomas, Von Miller IMO
Donald, Watt, Watt, Von, Ramsey
I love TJ, but I'm obviously biased.  &#x200B;  I also think Fred Warner needs to at least be in the conversation.
JJ watt no. If you can't stay on the field you aren't on any of my lists
Gotta go with Sherman , Seattle and San Fran where top 3 defenses every year with his presence
I think it's important to point out because it's often overlooked: Chandler Jones has almost identical numbers when compared to JJ Watt. He's been an extremely underrated player when you consider that one is viewed as a 1st ballot no doubt HoFer and the other most people aren't sure about.
Donald  Jj  Von  Luke  Ramsay (I wanted to pick someone in the secondary, say what you will about him but he’s been consistent since he’s been in the league)
1. Aaron Donald 2. Von Miller 3. Bobby Wagner 4. Luke Kuechly 5. Chris Jones  JJ Watt was not healthy enough to beat a consistently elite player in Jones.
Aaron Donald, JJ Watt, Myles Garrett, Von Miller, and Richard Sherman
Harrison Smith!
There are too many other amazing defenders to consider for me not to take Miller's PED history, and his attempt to cover it up, into consideration.  If he was far and away, I would. But too many are too close.  I'd add Chandler Jones, Richard Sherman, etc........
Revis Island.
Hitman harry
dylan, dylan, dylan, dylan, dylan
Von > JJ and it might not even be close
As a Niner fan, Bosa isn’t ready for this conversation yet. But he absolutely will be in a few years.
The Chris Jones disrespect is unreal… best defense player not named AD
Levante David!  Check yo sheet!
Biased but AD is number 1 by a decent gap
I'd take Richard Sherman on that list before Bobby Wagner, if you insist a Seahawk must be on it.
Lavonte David probably in the conversation for LB
He kind of straddled two decades and his career ended somewhat early, but surprised so far that not a lot of people mention Patrick Willis.
Patrick Willis
Ramsey has got to be in consideration.
People bringing up individual stats for Wagner and David, but I wonder how Luke’s stats would look if he wasn’t telling everyone on his team where the ball was going. The chess matches he played with QBs is immeasurable. But yes I’m a homer sooo
Just as overall defenders it's hard to pick 5. I tend to break it down by position since each has it's own specialty.  CB - Jalen Ramsey  LB - Mack  DT - Aaron Donald  DE - Von Miller  S - Cam Chancellor  This was all off the top of my head, so I'm sure I will think of more choices for debates as time goes on.
Browns fans will be sad to not see Myles Garrett on a lot of these lists.
Mack had 1 dominant year with the raiders and hadn't really lived up to that year since; a steady decline.   TJ broke the all time sack record so he would most likely be in the 2020 decade in my opinion as the most dominant defensive player.  Garrett is just getting started on the "dominating" thanks to his suspension lol so not even in my top 10 most dominating.  Both Bosa's are good/great players but are not complete game wreckers like AD and JJ are so that's why I leave them off my list. Nick is more of a chance to be on the 2020 decade in my opinion once again.   Keuchly is one of the best linebackers to ever play the game so he could easily be on this list (and would be if it weren't for injuries forcing early retirement).   All members of the LOB are hall of famers and most definitely influenced how the game/positions are played but once again injuries affected their "dominance" so in my opinion not worthy of top 5 but definitely Top 10.   With all this being said, the answer is Keuchly.
Patrick Willis
Within the last decade or FOR the last decade? I believe Antoine Winfield didn't give up a single touchdown in his last 3 years or something crazy
There has been NO DEFENSE allowed in last decade...
Donald and Watt,sure but also Brian Urlacher.
I personally have to say Watt. I get that the narrative is that Donald is the greatest defender ever, but Watts peak was much higher and much more dangerous as a defender.   With Donald, you get plays like the game winning rush from the Super Bowl. A phenomenal physical effort, overpowering multiple blockers, and being a force in the face of the quarterback.  JJ Watt, he could rush. Or he would swat the pass into the stands. Or he would drop ever so slightly and pick it off. He was a massive human being at a position that values small and quick. He had the gimmicky tight end touchdowns to arguably help, but it's a rare achievement for a defensive player to get serious consideration for MVP, and he earned every single one of those votes.  Donald, you're going to get a destructive interior player who wrecks the game plan. Watt just did so much more. I'd add that Watt was much more "the guy" for his team than Donald. If you were playing the Texans, Watt controlled what both his defense and his offense needed. It's more intangible, but I don't see quite the same imprint on the Rams from Donald.
Revis Bobby JJ AD Kam
Keuchly better than Wagner in all aspects
How is Sherman on here but not Revis lmao
Harrison smith look at his numbers next to Troy polamalu
So many deserving names  Aaron Donald  JJ Watt  Richard Sherman  Kam Chancellor  Von Miller  Bobby Wagner  Patrick Peterson  Harrison Smith  Earl Thomas  Khalil Mack  Luke Keuchly
A list that doesn't include Luke Kuechly is not a good list. Made All-Pro 7 of 8 seasons, plus DROY and DPOY
Best (peak) at any point over the last 10 years: Eric Kendricks, Aaron Donald, Micah Parsons, Slay, Sauce.  If best includes longevity, OPs list is pretty good.  Keuchly as the 5th.
It's tough to put any corners in the list, they tend to have 2-3 years of elite level, and then fall off the earth these days. (Sherman, Josh Norman, Aqib Talib, Patrick Peterson, Stephon Gilmore).  I feel Khalil Mack has the best combination of top peak, and best longevity out of the rest of the bunch.
Worth noting Kuechly might be the last off ball lineback to ever win DPOY.
Bam-bam Kam. Put the fear of god in opposing offenses
Speedhawk
Man  no CB love. Sherm is the man.
Champ Bailey? Doesn’t totally fit because the last decade doesn’t cover his peak. But he is one of the best defenders (first-ballot HoF) who have played within the last 10 years (barely — his last season was 2013). Guy was silently amazing and better than plenty of guys who talk way more.
The absolute no brainers JJ Watt Aaron Donald  The next 3 Luke Keuchly Von Miller TJ Watt
Keuchly was way better than Bobby Wagner. Retired early and still an automatic HOFer
JJ Watt, AD, Keuchly, Sherman, Wagner
Luke Kuechly deserves to be on this list. They way he processed the play, tackled with perfect form, moved sideline to sideline, makes him one of the best middle linebackers ever. His knowledge of the game and offensive vs defensive schemes puts him on par Peyton Manning. Career stats: 690 solo tackles 402 assists 12.5 sacks  9 fumble recoveries  7 Pro Bowls 1 Defensive Player of the Year Award 1 Defensive Rookie of the Year
khalil mack
Heyo!
Rusty Hardin and the Texans for the honorable mention
The GOAT
I think he meant “hardware”
Yes, he has quite the antique teaspoon collection.  It is delightful.
It’s a (euro-derived) soccer term meaning trophy. It makes more sense in that context because there are a bunch of different trophies a team can win (champions league, Europa league, conference league, club World Cup, league title, national association title, etc.), as opposed to the US professional leagues where there usually just one trophy (nobody really cares about presidents trophy in the NHL). I’ve seen soccer terms pop up a few times here over the last few months. Kind of interesting.
I think accolades. Watt had 3 All-Pros to Donald's 7, and in this decade Donald had 3 DPOYs to Watt's 2.
Yes
Think he's talking about DPoY awards? But as mentioned, definitely meant to say "hardware," not "silverware" lol
He eats his chicken and broccoli
I still honestly can’t believe that happened. It has to be a joke… right?!
I understood that reference!
I think he’s talking about Deebo’s son.
>	1st-team All-Pro twice (both within the last decade), and was on the 2010’s All-Decade team.  Sherman has 3x 1st team all-pro and 2x second team all-pro and was also on the 2010’s All-Decade team.
No it was weird that Sherman was listed and not PP. I know a lot of people still think Sherman was better but to just put Sherman was odd.
Probably because he’s been teetering on washed for a couple seasons. Harder to take the long view when he’s still in the league and an average corner at best, which will change once he hangs it up
As a division opponent most of his career I’ve always had a lot of respect for him.
Am I asinine to rank Ramsey over him on that list ?
That 30 for 30 season was special
Jameis Winston the 12th man every team he faces
Damn Jameis catching strays smh
Watt over Donald is insane
Kam’s prime with that LOB defense was phenomenal, he was the captain of the defense, covered like one of the best safeties, and played the run like a elite linebacker. Thomas and Sherman shined but Kam was truly the tone setter for the defense. Injuries made him decline in his later years and he had to retire early so his longevity wasn’t great but he was arguably the Seahawks best defender in terms of versatility during those years on a stacked defense. He played with a rare physicality that we rarely see anymore but it ultimately cut his career short.   I wouldn’t put him top 5 best defensive players in the past decade but he’s def underrated
I’m so glad Kam is getting this respect. Between posts like this and an earlier post yesterday in the NFL sub, I truly didn’t know other fanbases felt this way about him. His career being cut short was terrible. He was an absolute force and I genuinely believe he got pretty deep into opponent’s heads without saying a word. He put fear into those dudes. That is true respect.
Kam Chancellor the Touchdown Canceler
Yep Kam should have won super bowl MVP, he had your guys playing scared and tilted after the first three snaps.
100% was MVP of that game. Smith got the pick-6 and all but Kim was the most important player on that D. The hit he gave to Demaryius Thomas continues to make me hurt inside when I think about it.
By what metrics were they the best offense in history? Not saying they weren't! Just wondering
That’s what made the pats win so impressive in 2014
Kam wasn’t even a top 3 player on that defense and has zero first team all pros. He’s not even in the conversation for top 5 defensive player of the decade.  Edit: this isn’t even a debate. The 2010s all decade team safeties were Berry, Thomas, and Weddle. I know longevity counts for something, but I don’t think it’s debatable that Kam wasn’t as good as Berry/Thomas
Glad someone said it. Harrison Smith is consistently underrated. The man can do it all at safety at a high level and like you said has for 10+ years.
Chris Harris was playing last year lmao
Perfectly laid out. If Donald hadn’t spent the last 9 years completely destroying everyone’s expectation of the DT position Fletcher would’ve gotten a lot more recognition as one of the top defensive players in the league. I think being the best at your position gives you a good argument for this discussion, ie David, Earl Thomas, Wagner, etc. It’s a much easier argument than “if Donald didn’t exist…”
Frank Clark at DT too
What is up with the JJ over Donald takes? JJ had the best season (2014). But this is who had the best decade.  In the time AD was winning 3 DPOYs and 7 1st team All Pros, JJ had 5 seasons with less than 5 sacks.  He only played more than 8 games in 5 of 10 years this past decade.   Donald played 9 seasons in the last decade, only seasons he missed AP1 was as a rookie (won DROY) and last season when he got shut down early cause the Rams sucked.
Those damn refs!!!
Donald is on a tier of his own
I would agree JJ as one. His impact was huge, he just happened to be on a bad Texans team.
He never gets his flowers fr
It’s not like Luke was on a team with huge amount of success. Really they only has that one season
Luke Keuchly was a menace. Loved watching him when the Falcons played the Panthers. Really sucks his career was shortened but happy to see that he’s doing well now.
Watt had 3 DPOY’s not 2
Von Miller was never DPOY. If I’m not mistaken he was a single vote away from getting it but lost to Khalil Mack in 2016
Bro you got all of Watt’s accolades fucked up lol  He didn’t even get in the NFL til 2011 so when did he win his first DPOY?
Von does not have a DPOY
Are people arguing Donald > LT? Fuckin’ trippin’.
Watt is 3× NFL Defensive Player of the Year (2012, 2014, 2015), 5× First-team All-Pro (2012–2015, 2018)
>JJ Watt. 2 DPOYS, 3 All-Pros. Had imo the greatest peak of any defender ever, but his longevity and the fact that his 1rst DPOY wasn't from the 2010's drags him down.  Accccckkkkkkkkkshuuuwallllly JJ Watt won three DPOYs during the 2010s (he was drafted in 2011...) - 2012, 2014, and 2015   He technically made two All-Pro teams in 2014 - 1st team at DE, 2nd at DT. Should have won MVP that 2014 season, too - 20.5 sacks, 29 TFL, 51 QB hits, 78 tackles, 10 PD, 1 safety, 1 INT, 4 FF, 5 FR, and 5 TDs (3 while playing on offense).   Still think if the Texans make the playoffs that season (we were 9-7, I think) he would have won over Rodgers.
Kuechly is awesome but I feel like if he didn’t have that DPOY we maybe talk about him differently. It should’ve gone to David that year
All of 3 of Watt’s DPOY’s came between 12-15. That’s the 2010’s.
He was so special on the field.
good call brother
This is about the last decade. Patrick played one season. He was an absolute beast in his time though.
As a hawks fan, I feared that man twice a year. He was unreal. Always had a lot of respect for alooot of y’all defensive players
Better off using Warner for this. It's only for the last decade, Willis was barely a part of the last decade. If Warner had about 3 more years under his belt playing how he is I think he makes this list
He did WHAT to Kelce?!?!
Gross.
Lol I’ve seen almost every core member of the LoB mentioned in this thread, it goes without saying but what a defense we had
Fair and unbiased. Good take
I would replace Aaron Donald with Brandon Mebane: https://www.seahawks.com/video/brandon-mebane-celebrates-with-belly-dance-62926
Wagner and David should also both be applauded for their availability. They’ve both essentially averaged 15 games started & played per year for their entire careers. Which is pretty insane for 2 super physical guys that are involved in so many plays.
My favorite player but didn't have the longevity.
I’m a bit biased as well but I don’t really understand the logic in this take. I mean their peaks are similar but Wagner has more silverware and way better longevity. Luke is obviously a great player and maybe number 5 on this list but I just don’t see him being above Wagner.
I think both in their primes he’s a better player than Wagner but Kuechly retired too early you got give it to Wagner for longevity
Sorry but Wagner has the ring and longevity while being practically neck and neck with Keuchly in their primes, that being said Keuchly is the clear fifth guy on the list imo bc he’s just as good as Wagner was if not slightly better at his peak
When they were both in the league, they were near equal, where you could debate who was best. Wagner now has the longevity to give him a clear tiebreaker.
That's a joke. Easily as good when they both played and way longer career
The only one in this conversation to break the single season sack record.   The Steelers records with and without him the past few years are ridiculous. I don't understand how you can put anyone but Aaron Donald over TJ.
Lavonte David might be the most shafted player ever, absolutely incredible, but shared a conference with Kuechly and Wagner who are also absolutely incredible. Real shame he didn't get more accolades
Sherman over Kuechly is a joke
49ers fan would know. LOB owned them for half a decade.
Harrison smith has been one of the best safeties for so long and you forget he even exists. There was that little thing where someone called him a dirty player but mostly he is just overlooked and he could potentially be a hall of famer
Kept scrolling just to find this answer. Never gets the respect he deserves
Earl, Kuechly, and Chancellor were all better player than Sherman
Sneaky good call. I think he’s just outside but you can easily make a case.
Mack over Von is crazy to me. Mack isn’t even top 5 of the decade. Probably not even top 10.
AD is definitely ahead of JJ Watt. And how do you have Mack over Von Miller?  AD = 3 DPOYs, 7 All Pros that decade  JJ = 2 DPOYs, 3 All Pros that decade  &#x200B;  Those are really big misses.  Also need a DB, and should be Sherman. Revis was done by 2016.
Sherm, Thomas and Wagner are definitively top 10. Depending on how wide we open the window guys like Polomolou and Ed Reed probably belong on the list. This is the problem with a “top 5” defenders list, the five names I threw out only reflect 3 positions, and you could pick a dominant era of a single team and argue that multiple players are in that group.
Why do you say that? Both are similar in play style. Obviously one is still playing while the other is retired...  If you capped their careers when Kuechly retired, why do you say he is over Wagner?
Wagner was rated as the best linebacker in the NFL Last year by PFF. kueckly hasn't even been in the league
I love Revis, one of my all time favorites, but last decade starts 2013. He was insane, but a lot of it was during 2007-2012
Upvote for Revis. Total game changer. Although I still might have Von Miller higher since he can impact a game more directly whereas teams can avoid Revis.
Not just the highest peak of any corner from the last decade (only corner to win DPOY in that span), but STILL playing at an extremely high level to this day. I don’t think he’s the best corner in the league like he once was, but I absolutely see him in the upper echelon and view Dallas trading for him as the best move of the offseason.   You can argue that he’s the best corner of the last 10 years. At worst, he’s top 3. But he has all the accolades of all the other top corners plus he’s the only corner of this era to win DPOY which is an absolutely massive legacy builder.
People forget he was DPOY as a DB, specifically a CB. Really challenging to do when your opponents are prime Aaron Donald, Bobby Wagner and an injury prone but still great JJ Watt
No bias here!
Sounds right to me
Nevarro fucking Bowleg
Gilmore had one of the best seasons ever and a solid stretch but his first couple years in New England and his years in Buffalo weren’t amazing
As was Julius Peppers
He doesn’t even have a decade of a body of work lol. Don’t get me wrong he’s elite but like. Top 5 since 2013 when he wasn’t drafted until 3 years later? Hmm.
Not even close?? That’s big homer energy. They’re both phenomenal, and I think it’s fair to say clearly the top two defensive players of the decade.
Over their careers? Yes. Over the past decade? Zero chance.
Charles woodson played 3 seasons and had one pro bowl over the last decade. Hall of famer and one of the best to ever do it but not really what the question was asking
ring + longevity >
last decade as in 2013 and forward. Reed retired in 2013
Actually, no he does not.
Myles Garrett has left the chat without responding *
Miles Garrett has never dragged a team to the playoffs
You most definitely are. Dude has 2 Pro Bowls over the past decade and that's it. Literally, old Suh has done more in this past decade, which doesn't even count his best years.
A guy with 4 years played and 37.5 career sacks isn’t a top 5 player of the last decade. Maybe he could be in a few years.
Maxx Crosby has one 2nd Team All-Pro and two Pro Bowls in four years.  Watt had two DPOY awards by that point.  Donald had a DPOY, DROY, and three 1st team All-Pros; that's the same for Kuechly. Mack had a DPOY and two All-Pros.  Miller had three All-Pros (1x, 2x).  Sherman had three 1st team All-Pros.  Crosby's great, but he's nowhere near this discussion.
His best years are ahead of him. 12.5 sack career high isn't good enough.
I'm so confused on why people are picking Chris Jones so much. The dude's best year with this past season, and he still only finished 3rd in Defensive Player of the Year voting. He has some accolades, but the guy certainly has never even been the top defensive player in any year he has played, let alone the last decade.
He was balling out around 2008-2011, so a lot of his best years don't fall into this question unfortunately.
In the past decade alone, he had:  * 4 First Team All Pro * 4 Pro Bowls * 2 Defensive Player of the Years  Since his career spans past the last decade, that is actually discounting one of his DPoY awards, a Pro Bowl and a 1st Team All Pro.  He also finished 2nd in NFL MVP voting in 2014 with 13 votes. This might not sound like a lot, but defensive players pretty much max out at 1-2 votes on an incredible year.
Chris Jones over JJ Watt is literal clown thinking.   Jones has played 7 years so far, and has:  * 1 First team All Pro * 3 Second team All Pro * 4 Pro Bowls  By JJ Watt's 7th year, he had:  * 3 Defensive Player of the Year * 4 First Team All Pro * 4 Pro Bowls * 2nd place in AP MVP voting (sure, he didn't win, but a defensive player coming in the voting at all is RARE)  Sure, some of Watt's awards span back to 2012, but even if you choose the ones from just the last decade, you are still left with:  * 4 First Team All Pro * 4 Pro Bowls * 2 Defensive Player of the Years  Those accolades alone say enough. Chris Jones' highest ranking in DPoY was third place this last year, and was never even nominated before then.  Longevity my ass. You just forgot just how good Watt was.
Jones was suspended for 4 games for PEDs
2013-2023
That goes through my head every time I read a good joke, but this is the first time I’ve seen it written.  Well done.
AD has the most dominant software
They got that silverware because they eatin'.
I can see that on the internet, what I dont see is the derivative actually being used in the US, which is maybe why so many were confused.
None of that is silverware..
But, why?   Silverware is eating utensils
Please just say hardware or accolades. We can’t take it
Its an English thing for sure, silverware when referring to trophies is extremely common here. Probably because all our football trophies are silver.
He’s used to be a huge piece of shit.  Wore little bitty jeans, ate chicken spaghetti at Chickaletti’s
Sounded like a joke to me but everyone took it seriously lol
He’s also mentioned in the original post.
Better defense
nah it makes sense, on top 2 first-team APs Richard Sherman also has 3 second-teams (spread across 8 seasons, compared to 3 for P2) to P2's 0. P2 was definitely consistent as well but Richard Sherman was consistently top 4 at his position for 8 years + I personally don't value Pro Bowls anywhere near as much as APs
Peterson forgot to go on National TV and scream how great he was to a sideline reporter.
One difference worth noting is Pat P is 3 years younger, and accordingly, has been more productive over the second half of the decade.   But, prime for prime, yeah... Sherman's the superior CB.
Sherman talked more
Funny enough, he was actually very good this year. Only allowed 2 touchdowns, was third in the league in PBUs, had a good catch rate against. And had a PPF grade of 80.7 (if that means anything to you)   Also he was down like 20 lbs. from his prime playing weight. Dude is obviously putting the work in to be competitive during his twilight years and it’s paying off.
There were two other things in my opinion as someone who watched a lot of Cards games. He was so good in coverage for a while no one threw his way. Making him forgotten a lot of times, at least in regards to national attention. He also avoided contact when it when it came to tackling. Too many "business decisions" during his time in AZ.
But he was amazing last year lmao
Yes.
What the fuck is this take, Ramsey has never even been the best corner in the league, let alone over PP.
Ending it with a Pick 6 to lose the game was the fairytale ending
His 30th interception was a pick 6 in the final week of the season in OT vs the Falcons. It was fucking beautiful.
Yes it was.
That legit may never happen again
ESPN's 30 for 30 presents: 30 for 30
Can I ask what this is in reference to?
lol no he throwing strays, it's the defenders that catch em
jfc watching him [broad jump over the entire offensive line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FW6GLA761A) during FGs must have been fucking terrifying
I watched a game where he jumped over the line on back to back plays to try to block an extra point. Jumped over the line, blocked the kicked penalty called back, did it a-fucking-gain. For an extra point. Not a game winning field goal. I can’t stand the shithawks but Bam Bam will always be one of my favorite players.
Kam falls into that category of someone like Brian Dawkins. The dude just looks absolutely terrifying and there’s nothing NFL fans love more than a dude who just intimidates an entire offense. Kam may not have been better than earl thomas or sherm or bwags but I think he’s the favorite of that team by a majority
Vernon Davis agrees.
He of Many Nicknames
Punching the ball from Megatrons hands right as he was crossing the line, lived up to the name
Absolutely. Broncos were a finesse team that relied on everything clicking, and when it did, they were impossible to stop. But Kam really set the tone, especially with that hit on Demaryius Thomas, and the Broncos had no answer for that type of physicality. the offense looked wide-eyed and scared all night.
Most points per game and most passing touchdowns, I believe. Broke the records set by the Pats in 2007.   Certainly may have been surpassed by now. I haven’t checked. But in 2013, they set the records.   And then came the Seahawks haha
Probably one of the best played super bowls ever. No blowout. No big comeback needed. The 2 best teams in the NFL playing like the 2 best teams in the NFL.
I do agree with you that he’s definitely not one of the top players of the decade or even the best player for the Seahawks around that time. Besides that point, I think a lot of Seahawks fans would argue that Kam was the heart and soul of that defense. Kam was the guy who set the tone for the LOB. He wasn’t the best player on Seahawks defense but the dude such a fun player to watch.
Kam was not the most talented player on that defense but it turns out later he was the most important player:  He kept both Thomas and Sherman in line, once he was gone there was no one left to reign them in.
You're getting downvoted because you're trying to say they're wrong when they didn't even claim he was top 5 in the decade
Why the hell is this being downvoted? Kam was super fun to watch but it’s ridiculous to put him even in the conversation of the best defensive players of the era, come on.
Found the stat-sniffing nephew. Clean your nose!
And the Bears suck shit
Chancellor isn't even a top 5 safety of the decade
Dude had a better career than Earl Thomas. Fight me.
This is one of the most shocking things I've ever read lol
I personally have Aaron Donald ahead of JJ Watt because of availability. JJ was the best defender in the league for 3 seasons while you could argue AD was the best for 6.
It’s not a 1a 1b situation. AD clears JJ
No it isn’t the post doesn’t say who had the best decade that would be dumb because that’s heavily dependent on when players started their career.      Who are the 5 best of the last decade and who had the best decade are two completely different questions.
Donald has a much better overall career. Way more consistent and consistent at an elite level.
In his prime Jj was more dominant imo. Donald is unreal, has had the better career, but JJ’s best year was better than AD’s best.
JJ isn't insufferable like the other option
Yeah I’m generally of the mindset that if we’re talking peaks it’s JJ > basically anyone who has ever played, but you can’t really make an argument for his last decade over Donald. Especially since his 2012 season technically doesn’t count for this
God not this again. JJ Watt at his peak was far more dominant than Aaron Donald has ever been. Donald is a clear step below, and that’s not an insult to him in any way.
JJ Watt has a case for the GOAT defensive player I firmly disagree with the case but he does have one
> What is up with the JJ over Donald takes?  You can play Watt anywhere on the line and get all time great performance out of him.
They still had a much better defense for longer. We had shitty defense despite Lavonte’s dominance. I’d put Keuchly above him (Keuchly’s presnap communication was second to none when he played) but on paper Lavonte had arguably better numbers than him and Bobby.
People really sleep on David. Better stats than Wagner or Kuechly. If he'd had the same career most any other place than Tampa, he'd be high on this list.   During the time Keuchly was in the league, David had more solo tackles, more QB hits, more sacks, more forced fumbles/recoveries, and more tackles for loss. Kuechly only leads in assists, interceptions and playoff games.   Same when compared to Wagner. Wagner only leads in assists, QB hits and sacks (barely).
Ehh we had plenty of ups and downs but from 2010-2019 we made the playoffs 4 times and had three seasons with 11+ wins. Nothing world beating outside of 2015 but still pretty different than the Bucs who lost the division 7/10 years and never made the playoffs in that same time.
Even when he got Moss’d by Julio, it was still damn impressive that he forced one of the best receivers in the league to make a leaping circus catch over him 40+ yards down field.
JJ also had 7 all pros (5 first team 2 second) not 3. Not sure where the comment got their stats from lol.
In his first 5 years, mind you
Ya but, a superb owl mvp
Really? I would have imagined he won it at some point. huh
I mean it's not that crazy of a comparison. 7 first team all-pros to LT's 8, and they each have 3 dpoys. sure Taylor has the MVP season but Donald matched his 20.5 sacks in 2018. imo Donald needs a few more seasons of elite play before he catches up but there is an argument to be made
Yeah, that is crazy talk.    I am guessing the dude never saw Reggie White in his prime either.    I would rank them far above Donald.
>	Kuechly is awesome but I feel like if he didn’t have that DPOY we maybe talk about him differently.  That can be said for a lot of/most players who won MVP or DPOY. What’s your point? He *did* win it.   Also how much differently? Dude was all-pro for **seven** years in a row (five of those being first team) and was on the all-decade team
Bowman, little biased but still.
2023-2013 is what I'm referring to.
Its ok dude I also am still mentally in 2020 this whole quirky world disease thing distorted time
And pretty unique off it too
I hope writers don't hold him going off the deep end against him when its HOF time, because he was a shoo in on his play alone and it's not as if he was a killer or rapist or something off of it
Wow, time has flown. Goddamn
Why would silverware matter for who’s a better off ball linebacker lmao?
No dog in the fight, but Keuchly was better all-around
But is it “best” or “best career”
I just disagree with this. Kuechly was far and away the best middle linebacker and was better than Wagner , who is a Hall of Famer in his own right, not to discredit him at all. But Kuechly was just different man.
Yeah I dunno, when they both played if you asked me who the best off ball LB was I think it would have felt like a pretty clear answer
You're right. Dominic Easley is as good
He was 2nd best. Good, but not as good as Kuechly
Yeah I don't know about #2, but he definitely deserves to be in the conversation of top 5 if people are putting Mack and/or Miller on there.  Only thing holding him back is the fact he's only played six seasons of the last decade.  Watt has a DPOY as well as a 2nd and 3rd place finish, same as Mack.  He also has the same number of all pro selections as Mack, which are both more than Miller over the last decade.  He's done all this while playing four less seasons over the last decade than those two.  Imo he's easily over Mack and Miller in this discussion.  He has the sack record (in only 15 games), and is also a more well rounded player than Mack and Miller.  They put Watt in coverage much more than the average edge rusher (six interceptions in six years).  I'm a Chiefs fan, but one of my good friends is a Steelers fan and he's annoying with his praise of Watt, but I also can't deny how great he is.  Like you said, it's night and day for the Steelers defense when he's on/off the field.
His numbers are all better than Wagner and Kuechley.   He just got screwed because some voters would but him at edge for All Pro voting
Which is why I gave respect to them homie. Lol. Wouldn’t say owned either. Had a lot of close games and won plenty of them. But the LOB was scary AF. No doubt about that.
Agree, he’s low profile and rarely gets hurt. Not to mention well rounded. Sacks, tackles, and int. He does it all
I love him to death, he's the only LOB jersey I own, but Kam was not better than Sherm
That's almost entirely because his best seasons were on some highly questionable Raiders teams that he kept afloat for long periods of time. Mack's production as a playmaker when the entire opposing offense could key on him was pretty amazing.  Meanwhile Von had Dumervil, Ware, and Chubb amongst others on a much better overall defense.  I dunno if Mack would prove out as the better player even in better situations, but Von definitely got opportunities Mack didn't.
>Mack over Von is crazy to me.   Advanced statistics.  I think he's putting a *lot* of weight into their GSAAB when ranking them. Looking at their GSAAB's, Mack has a whopping 52 compared to Miller's dismal zero.  (In case you're not familiar with this statistic, GSAAB is calculated by tallying games started as a Bear).
People really sleep on Mack’s run defense. He was an elite run stopper and top edge rusher. There’s a reason he won a DPOY and Miller didn’t.
AD is not definitely ahead of Watt. AD has longevity but Watt’s peak was higher.  DB should be Revis.
Nah JJ over AD, not just going to go by accolades, JJ was ELITE at one of the top positions.
I’m no expert by any means but when watching the panthers play Kuechly was clearly the best defender each and every game and just popped on the screen. Wagner has been great but had more talent around him throughout his entire career and wasn’t always the best defender on the team
Kuechly’s pre-snap reads were insanely good. Wagner, and even David are just not in that level. Kuechly was a true QB of the defense, while David and Wagner were just extremely good off ball LBs
I think that rating shows a flaw in PFFs system
Also JJ over AD???  JJ had 2 DPOYs and 3 AP1's last decade.  AD had 3 DPOYs, and 7 AP1's last decade.
Revis was the first that sprung to mind for me as a miss on this list….then it dawned on me it’s 2023. Fuck
Yeah, I think him and Willis just miss the cut. Two absolute monsters.
Yep, and was a huge factor in their 2017 Super Bowl run (which they unfortunately lost) and should’ve been the 2018 Super Bowl MVP.  Peak obviously not comparable to some of the guys on this list, but thought he deserved at least a mention.
Lol numbers prove it
One pro bowl in the past decade.
Next up, can Newton is better than Russell Wilson. Homers
He played with the Jets and Houston IN 2013.
Because "people" watch him on tape and know he carries the Chiefs entire defense on his back. No he's never been the best player in any given season, because his career has overlapped with the other 4 guys I listed but his entire body of work and level of consistency throughout his career puts him in the category of best defenders of the decade.
He had 4 good seasons, then barely played. He was basically dead money on the cap for 6 years in a row.  Chris Jones has been 2nd to Donald for years and is now the best DT.  You aren't worth anything if you can't stay healthy.
Yes, I am a hypocrite. :)  My thing with Miller is not only that he was caught, but his scheme to cover it up. Some people get caught and either offer excuses or take ownership. Miller sought out the urine collector and attempted to cover it up. Not much of an ethical difference, but an ethical difference   But yes, your point stands. I admit my hypocrisy
I think Clowney still needs a patch update
Well, guess I don't know what silverware is then lol.
Are you trolling or 12?
Its a common thing for people to refer to trophys as silverware. Popular in the uk too I think
Silverware includes dishes, plates, and cups etc. So long as they're silver.  Internationally alot of sports have some kind of silver cup for their trophy hence in the UK at least silverware means trophies.
I heard he slicked his hair back too
Lives for New Year’s Eve.
Im afraid the baby thinks people can't change
Yeah I think people were looking for more reasons to hate him. He’s stupid enough as it is
Correct - he is better and they both play defense lol
The  most ironic thing about this is sorry ass receiver Crabtree would usually play well against Pat Pete in their matchups. It's that weird thing where some elite players just for some reason have some not-so-elite players they can never quite figure out. Crabtree was often that for Pat Pete.  Kinda like Stevie Johnson for Darelle Revis.
Peterson also forgot to tip a game winning interception against his arch nemesis to go to the Super Bowl.
Cardinals fans seem to remember a lot of poor tackling, but with us, he was down-right vicious sometimes.
He's still great in zone, that PPF rating doesn't lie
Lol the "business decision" take is so bad lol. Straight outta Keim and Bidwell's mouths.
Sheesh I thought my take was far fetched but Ramsey has been pro bowl every year in his career man, and 3 times first team all pro. Saying he’s never been best corner one of those years is a wild statement imo. I think he gets the nod the year the rams won the chip
Peterson hasn't made 1st team all pro since Ramsey came into the league. Ramsey has 3 times...
Ramsey has been the best corner in the league multiple years
I monkey paw'd it, Julio needed just 6 more yards to break 1,400 yards, which would've been his 6th straight (his 5 straight is already a NFL record, so he would've extended it), but anyways.. I said "I hope Jones gets ball one more time".. ended up being Deion Jones getting the game sealing INT lmao
Especially because without that we resign him and never get Brady
you would be benched after 20
Jameis throwing 30 TD’s and picks in one season
And he did it twice in a row!
Had a ninety yard pick six to ice that game too
The Deathbacker
Thank you for reply
By advanced metric they were amazing, but far from best ever: https://www.footballoutsiders.com/dvoa-analysis/2020/historical-dvoa-estimates-revisited
I’m not arguing that, but that’s a completely separate argument. Wagner, Thomas, and Sherman were all better players by literally every metric. It’s preposterous to argue otherwise
You think Kam was a better football player than Bobby Wagner, Luke Keuchly, Aaron Donald, JJ Watt, or Von Miller? Lol ok.
Worst team in the league, objectively
He’s #1 in our hearts, though.  At his peak, I wouldn’t have had any other safety over him… and I bet any WR would have played against any other safety but him.  He destroyed people’s souls.
I can’t believe I’m getting downvoted for what I thought should have been a very objective viewpoint. Harrison Smith is also better than Kam
Stats would back you up. Media market wouldn't. Sadly most people are focused on the latter.
Honestly I had to look it up, like I knew he went to the Chargers but I had no idea he went to the Saints
Watt has five first team all-pros, more career sacks and way more tackles than Donald.
I have JJ Watt as probably top ten player of all time.
I think that is just due to the decade barrier cutting off the beginning of Watts career. He loses 36.5 in 3 years and an incredibly good 2012 DPOY season. When comparing their careers as a whole (which Donald has all of his in the past decade) then 1a and 1b makes sense
When the Rams won the super bowl, people were talking about Aaron Donald being among the all-time greats on defense, and it wasn't a crazy argument. If you give me the choice of JJ Watt or Aaron Donald I'm taking the latter.
Nah. Not biased at all either 😂
Fewer sacks, fewer tackles, but sure, much better career.
Yeah people are putting JJ #1 cause we're thinking of his prime. I haven't seen a better defensive player, maybe just football player, than prime JJ Watt
Uhhhh… I hate to tell you buddy.
Idk for me he was one of the most insufferable NFL personalities in the last 20 years. Letter jackets and wood cabin shit, fucking pass.
Why is Aaron Donald insufferable?   Really decent family guy off the field. Plenty of charity and youth work.   On the field he can be aggressive, but I don’t think insufferable is the word to use.
>JJ Watt has a case for the GOAT defensive player  No way. He had 3 great seasons, 2 very good ones and that's it.  Need way more longevity.   I don't even get the JJ over AD takes.   AD has had 7 great seasons, 2 very good ones and he's still playing.
Depends what numbers. In that time span I’m pretty sure Luke has more tackles and ints while Levomte had more sacks  and FF.
Case study in why stats aren’t everything for off ball LBs. if stats were everything, then we’d probably come to the conclusion that Blake Martinez was on the level of these guys for a few seasons until his career got cut short by his Pokémon card trading hobby. David was good, but not on the level of Kuechly, especially if you watch the tape and see how Kuechly calls out plays pre snap
Last decade would be 2013-2023 and JJ won his first dpoy in 2012 so technically not a part of the least decade but yeah still misleading
Did you make up these stats? Half of them are wrong.    AD had 7x 1AP and 3x DPOY  JJ Watt had 5x 1AP and a should’ve been MVP season  and 3x DPOY  TJ watt has 3x 1AP the sack record and 1 DPOY  Von Miller has 2 rings, DROY, 3x 1AP and a Super Bowl MVP   I threw in TJ’s stats because I’m a homer and I think he has a prime shot of outpacing a lot of those DPOY and 1AP numbers in the next few years   The von Miller Super Bowl accolades would be a miracle to beat for TJ tho
I don't know LT was a freak of nature who changed the way the position was played. I'm wary of comparing stats between different eras.
Seriously, this is massive nephew shit.  AD is great but it's a different discussion.
> Dude was all-pro for seven years in a row (five of those being first team) and was on the all-decade team   Even more context is he only played for 8 years. The only year he wasn’t an all pro was his rookie year in which he lead the league in tackles and won defensive rookie of the year. Dude was an absolute monster.
Lawrence Taylor did a bunch of coke and cheated his UAs... being chased out of a threesome with your brother by your wife with a loaded gun aint so bad.
Nah, us ravens fans have a different memory of Earl…
It's absolutely horrifying.   I do not know that we've seen a duo like the double-mint twins. Bowman and Willis were an absolute force.
The only ILBs in history with more all pros than Wagz are Lewis and Singletary. That’s it. And Wagz ain’t done yet.   Honestly Bobby’s only fault is that he hates mayo.
Completely agree. If Kuechly had Wagner's longevity people would be scoffing at this. He was far and away the best LB when he was playing in my eyes.
Kuechly may have had the highest football IQ of any linebacker in NFL history, the dude seemed to know what play the offense was running before the QB even did.
Kuechly has similar stats to other players like David or Wagner, but he was doing insane stuff at the LOS, like calling out plays before the snap, which I don’t see Wagner or David doing. That’s what puts Kuechly above everyone else for me. Stats are comparable between Kuechly and the other top guys, but stats are relatively easy to rack up as a MLB, but Kuechlys game sense puts him far above everyone else  I think if people actually watched tape on these LBs instead of just looking at stats, they’d realize how insanely smart Kuechly was for an MLB. He was an actual QB of the defense
Wags also had an all-pro in Earl Thomas and (should've been an all-pro) Kam Chancellor behind him. Those two were way better than Tre Boston, Kurt Coleman, Colin Jones, and past his prime Roman Harper....
I’m completely unbiased and I agree
They’re not all better than Wagner or Kuechly, but they’re close enough that David should be recognized beside them. Part of the stat difference comes from playing different positions (OLB v ILB).   David: 166 games, 12 INT, 27 FF (holy shit), 29 Sacks, 1346 tackles, 143 TFL, 62 QBhits  Kuechly: 118 games, 18 INT (insane), 7 FF, 12.5 Sacks, 1092 Tackles, 75 TFL, 31 QBhits  Wagner: 168 games, 13 INT, 6 FF, 29 Sacks, 1523 Tackles (goddamn), 78 TFL, 88QBhits  I think all three deserve golden jackets.
This literally is not true.
No they aren't all better, his forced fumbles are way higher than either of those two but Wagner has hundreds more tackles than him, more QB hits, more sacks, and more INTs
ur no niners fan.  if they didn't hold every play things would be different.  don't bow to those fail mary fans
I recognize I came across as a dick. My bad. The rivalry was the beat in the NFL during that span, say 2012-2018. Most games were hard fought and I was on the edge of my seat. You guys always seem to get the best players.   All that being said, during the 2012 season thru 2018 season, which is when the LOB was most active, you guys were 3 and 12 against us. I’d say that’s owned. No disrespect meant. Those were the best games. I was at the one where Kam ended Vernon Davis’s career. Kap scared the shit out of me. Dude was one play from a TD every time he was under center.   Now we’re chasing you. Good luck.
I’m a Notre dame fan and he was amazing in college too. I guess that’s probably obvious but he’s one of my favorites from ND
Disagree. Kam was the best SS of the generation, and was the leader of the LoB, held it all together, Sherm wasn’t even a top 3 corner over that spam, PP, Revis, Gilmore, even Ramsey who I detest was better.
Mack got the opportunity to line up against Broncos human turnstile RT Donald Stephenson and get 4 sacks in a game, which ultimately propelled him to edge out Von for DPOY that year, while I (in my unbiased opinion) contend Von would’ve won if the broncos were any good that year  No I’m not salty, why do you ask
Von Miller is a scrub confirmed
Miller has 7 all pros, nfl DROTY, SB mvp, two SB championships, all decade team, and 123 sacks. It’s not even close. What does Mack have like one all pro? It’s not close.
Mack won DPOY because the Raiders went to the playoffs that year and the Broncos didn't. Von was DPOY favorite all year and then lost by one vote at the end despite the better season - multiple DPOY voters said the team success factored into their vote. Mack had a worse season, won thanks to being on a better team that year.  >Mack’s run defense. He was an elite run stopper      You think Von isn't? Von literally led the NFL in run-defense grade for multiple years.    Also, not for nothing given this is a "greatest" list, but Von is one of the greatest playoff defenders - at any position - in NFL history. The highest graded player in multiple Super Bowl runs, including carrying his team to a SB win and a Super Bowl MVP in one of the most dominant playoff runs ever.  Then he was the highest graded defender *again* for the Rams in *their* SB run.    Mack's playoff career of four games (all losses) with 0 FF, 0 FR, 0 INT, 3 QB hits and 1 sack doesn't quite meet that level.
DB should absolutely not be Revis.  He's been retired five of the last ten years, and his last two or three seasons, he was mediocre or worse.
How is the DB Revis if we're talking last decade?  His one good year with the Pats in 2014?  Also agreed on Watt, AD obviously has the accolades but man....JJ Watt from like 2012-2016 was insane.  I remember being in college finding sketchy streams just to watch JJ Watt play. They should both be on there in some fashion
I think the problem is that AD has the longevity, and his peak isn't *that* far behind Watt's. I mean, he had the greatest season ever at his position . And, as mentioned, Watt had 2 DPOYs the past decade, not 3.  Its a lot closer than OP is making it out to be though. It could go either way and I wouldn't argue it. I think   1a: Donald  1b: Watt  is the lineup for me.  But despite the fact, we should be grateful to have two of the greatest defensive talents ever in the span of 10 years
AD had 7 straight 1st team all pros. And is widely considered ahead of JJ on the Defensive Mount Rushmore  As for Revis, he was done by 2016. Sherman lasted most of the decade.
Copy. I can see that reasoning. Thank you for your insight.
So what you’re saying is Kuechly is better than Wagner because he didn’t have there supporting cast Wagner did? That’s non-sense
Why wasn’t Wagner pretty good last season?
JJ had 3 DPOY
Yeah probably not top 5 but I could see anywhere from 5-8
I'm just joking lmao. I think Ramsey is a great talent but I don't think he's above  Von  Donald  Watt  Luke  Wagner  Sherman  etc
And he wasn’t very effective in that one season.
Chris Jones still is 2nd to AD, at best. And that is only this past year.
Forks, knives, spoons etc...  Is this real?
Are you trolling or 11?  Sorry. But no, I'm not. I've literally never heard anyone say that for sports in the US
Gotta be a European thing? I've never heard anyone refer to trophies as silverware
No it isn't lol. I have never heard anyone in the US use silverware this way before this thread. Hardware all the time, but not silverware.
Only on the UK maybe. But no the US or for american football
The also call cookies biscuits and elevators lifts
You think this is slicked back?! This is PUSHED back
Sloppy Steaks at Tirfoni’s
I think I’m just gonna take the present that I brought here, and go home
Sherman was on a significantly better defense most of his career. Acting like him having an elite front 7 doesn't make his job easier and make him look significantly better is silly.
Stevie Johnson was the weirdest route runner I've ever seen. He was so choppy. It fucked up a whole lot of corners and he'd have huge days. Then a bum corner might figure it out and he'd completely disappear for an entire game.
He never says ass during that interview. FYI
Peterson also forgot to go to a super bowl or conference championship game, or lead the league in interceptions.
It's their dumbass owner and their dipshit ex gm saying that.
Fuck Keim and Bidwell. I watched the games and watched him pull up and avoid contact.
As far as I remember he wasn’t that great that year, it felt like he slowed down at one point. He was probably the best CB the year after Gilmore won DPOY though
I am giving it to Jaire in 2021. Hes been top 5, top 3, hes just never been the best in any single year to me.
It was 33:30 but no ever says that because it doesn't sound as good.
I was starting to forget how weird that was, but seeing it written out really reminded me. Such a weird and awesome season
Wait I thought Bobby did that
Was that the Cam to Kam?
Thank you for reply
That’s why I said “besides that point”. It wasn’t related to the argument of best player, I wasn’t arguing with you about that. I was just saying that I don’t think the rest of the LOB would’ve had anywhere near the same success or statistics without Kam. He elevated everyone around him and that’s just interesting to me.
Did I say that? No. You said Kam wasn’t even too 3 on that defense. Go ahead though, sip the kool-aid
Kam was better than Wagner when they played together. Bobby’s career has lasted longer but he didn’t have his best seasons until the LOB collapsed.
Weddle, Thomas, and Smith were all objectively better
In 1 more season Smith has more interceptions, tackles, PD, sacks. Same amount of defensive TD, 3 fewer forced fumbles but more fumble recoveries. Not to mention he only played with another elite defensive back for 2 years, compared to Thomas who had Chancelor and Sherman for an extended amount of time.
I'll give you the all pros but Donald plays a position that is far less conducive to sacks and tackles
So basically what you're saying is that JJ Watt has two less all-pros and 11 more sacks despite playing for 4 more seasons than Aaron Donald, who is an IDL and gets less sacks at his position?  Yeah..
But we aren't counting 2011 and 2012 so he only beats AD in tackles (and passes defensed, JJ is probably the best player at batting passes to ever play)
You’re comparing a defensive end to an interior defensive tackle. Considering they have the same season high in sacks at 20.5 ends the debate. Donald by miles. Donald’s 2018 has to be one of the top 4 or 5 most dominant seasons in nfl history. PFF has it as the highest graded defensive season in like 20 years
Deflected passes and touchdowns gotta count for something too
I’m surprised some people are reading it that way though. Who are the best of the last decade doesn’t mean who accomplished more in 10 years.      Watt was still playing at a high level the last decade. If we rank wrs the last decade would we really put diggs over Jefferson? Diggs has the longevity and the advantage because there’s more data points but in  3 years Jefferson has already established himself as a better wr than Diggs. Now AD has a strong case and if people want to choose him that’s fine, but I don’t think the question meant who had the best 10 years as a whole.
I mean JJ Watt is among the all time greats too. In 2014, people were talking about JJ in the same breath as LT and Reggie White.   In Donalds first couple years, it felt like Donald was only the best dlineman in the league cause Watt was hurt. Obviously that narrative changed starting with his 20.5 season, but if Watt couldve stayed healthy in 2016 and 2017 this is probably a much harder debate.  But health matters and thats what puts AD over the top for me.
Probably the best DT to ever play, insane considering his size
Sacks and tackles aren't the end all be all determining factor for impact
Sorry you're downvoted it's only cause most people here actually watch.
JJ’s great seasons were LT/Reggie White level. Look closer at his less-than-great seasons. He had 16 sacks one year and nobody noticed.   He’s got more career sacks and tackles than Donald.
That’s why I said arguably. For how comparable their numbers are you’d think Lavonte is in the conversation more.
David is good not was, he’s still playing.
God it felt so nice when have such an intimidating defense. Not just sheer size or strength, but the soul-crushing fear of knowing before you snap the ball that the very vocal leader of the other team’s defense is shouting exactly what you’re going to do 50% of the time must be terrifying.
> David was good, but not on the level of Kuechly, especially if you watch the tape and see how Kuechly calls out plays pre snap  A question and something to think about. Kuechly gets the rep as a mastermind. Why doesn't David get the same rep for being a weakside LB that can field general like a MLB and consistently blow up plays in background? Because there has been no better LB at cancelling out plays.
You couldn’t be more wrong on David and likely never watched tape on him. Better stats with way less talent around him than Kuechly had.
Well the all pros would still be wrong since only one wouldn’t have been from 13-23
>I don't know LT was a freak of nature who changed the way the position was played. I'm wary of comparing stats between different eras.  Lt changed, the way teams valued left tackles, but he also benefited from playing offenses that were not schematically prepared for an elite edge rusher
Has the expectation of what an elite DT not changed.  I recognize my own bias here but I'm not sure that's the argument why he's not comparable.
I think Donald has changed the DT position as well. Now it’s not uncommon to get a smaller, quicker DT who can also be a sack specialist rather than a hole plugging run stopper. Not changing how the offense operates as much, but what the “prototype” of what a DT needs to be.
AD is a bigger freak of nature than LT and LT is considered a game-changer because of the time he played. LT was 6'2.5,237 lbs and a game wrecker. The changed the game argument can be used in almost all sports when talking about the first to ever do it. If AD was doing what he is doing now in 1970's or 80's, he would also be considered a game changer. AD position is also quite frankly the harder position.
Does that make us the grumpy uncle ranting at family gatherings: “you kids today don’t realize that Red Grange was so much better than Saquan Barkley.  Can fancy Saquan win the Olympics without shoes??  One time, he even played without feet!”
>Bobby’s only fault is that he hates mayo  Take him off the list
Why would the safeties matter in this argument?
I'll agree. K was so much more instinctual about plays, and seemed a lot quicker to break up plays than BWag (who was just more powerful and stop anyone in his area than K)
Lavonte has as many TFLs as both of them combined and more than double the FFs they combine for. That’s insane.
I do think Lavonte is criminally underrated, but as a tangentially related point I also think LB is a position where counting stats are difficult to correlate to quality of play (I think this is sort of true for defense in general, aside from maybe pass rushers who have their impact scored in a pretty cut and dry stat). Number of tackles especially is a stat that includes a LOT of context on the field.  Anyway, not quibbling that Lavonte David deserves to be mentioned in these conversations—just opining that ILB is a position where it’s hard to make truly 1:1 statistical comparisons.
1 more int same sacks
I’m not bowing dude. And as a Niner fan, wouldn’t you have love for Sherman now?
That’s what it means to be a fan? To make lame excuses for why you lost?
Ya you guys won most, but they were all close games. With our championship coming down to a tipped ball. And that speaks nothing to the horribly blown calls that game. And L is an L and I take it, but the 49ers were 1 play or call away from going to their 2nd SB. Y’all ended up going and winning, but definitely not an owning situation. Not like currently where we are the Ram’s daddy. Haha.   Although they also beat us to go to a SB so they won the one that mattered most I guess.
Revis has literally 1 good year between 2013 and 2023 how is he better than Sherm in that span, Gilmore has 2 All Pros to Sherms 5
Mack got DPOY because the Broncos missed the playoffs and the Raiders overachieved and made the playoffs. Von lost it by one vote, and more than one voter said later the success of the team(s) factored into it.
Von balling the f out in the playoffs and dragging the corpse of Peyton Manning to a Super Bowl was an all time run. Mack is a great player but not quite on Von’s level.
Miller was great, too. I think Mack was the better player, he just didn’t have as many high profile moments because he played for bad teams. Go check out his PFF grades or read up on his peak run defense.
All good points.
Yeah honestly I already forgot how far into the 20s we are. COVID time warp and all that.  And yeah JJ and AD are 1a 1b to me but felt necessary to point out it’s not at all cut and dry. JJ arguably has the best 3 year peak of any defensive player ever.
His peak is far behind Watt’s.   Watt eclipses Donald by significant margins in every impact stat. If you were to make lists of their top single-season numbers, it’s a wall of Watt with an occasional Donald thrown in.
Idk where you’re getting AD widely better than JJ from
Yeah I think Wagner only became seen as the best linebacker after kuechly retired and even then only for a year or two.
Not last decade. His 1st was more than 10 years ago
Yeah Id say Shermans stats can stand up to Jalens. Definitely bias but CB the hardest position next to Q cant be all pass rushers
Geez...and your a Ravens fan?  Best safety ever for BAL.
According to Wikipedia, Silverware (in sports context) refers to trophy: [https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Silverware\_(sport)&redirect=no](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Silverware_(sport)&redirect=no)  So, a DPOY trophies would count, as would SB Rings.  But yes I know what a fork is lol
That’s cutlery
it's definitely a thing in soccer
Its extremely common in soccer.
He used to be a big piece of shit.
If you’re gonna make Sherman’s case with team accomplishments and the most overrated stat for judging corners, [at least get them all right.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Arizona_Cardinals_season)
If you watched that season you get to call it whatever you want, because you blocked out the trauma. The clench was never ending.
Bobby did it twice in a season once. Kam did it on consecutive snaps lol. It was wild.
Yup
agreed
He wasn’t…earl thomas, Richard Sherman, and Bobby Wagner were all better players. Michael Bennett has a strong argument too
Don’t forget Eric Berry
Check out those TFL too. It isn't even close 43 for Harrison Smith and 13 for Earl Thomas.
I hear people say this all the time but that’s just wrong. Watt was a 3-4 DE, which is not a position that is “far more conducive to sacks” than a 4-3 DT. In many schemes it’s actually the same position.   In fact, Wade Phillips was the DC for Watt in his prime, and also the DC for Donald in a good chunk of his prime. They both played the 3-technique in the same system for the same coordinator. If you look up Donald’s stats when Wade was there, you’ll notice he’s listed as a DE, not a DT.   Someone like Khalil Mack is a DE/OLB, which is far more conducive to sacks. Watt and Donald are both DE/DT.
I mean, first of all, that’s not some feather in his cap. It’s not like his sacks or tackles count more just because he’s a tackle. If he were as good as JJ Watt they would’ve moved him outside.   Also, that’s not even really true, he’s a 3-tech, that’s a pass rushing lineman, just like Warren Sapp, Chris Jones, etc. Watt was a 3-4 end, that’s traditionally a guy who either occupies two gaps or moves inside on pass rushing downs.   And finally, it’s not just sacks and tackles. Watt got more pressures, more QB hits, WAY more passes defensed. There’s no statistical argument that puts Donald anywhere near Watt, there’s a gulf between the two.
Donald was competing with DTs and Watt with DEs in all pro voting even though they basically played the same position. Spare me on the All-pro comparisons.
Watt played more games too. As of now he’s had more longevity and more production than Donald. People are just making shit up here.
I mean, how about tackles for loss? Watt has the all time record and three highest single-season totals. QB hits? Donald’s peak is 41, Watt topped that four times.  Basically, the only thing Donald was better at was letting the QB drop back, collect his reads, and calmly throw the ball to a receiver.
Oh well then it’s a bit of a wash, but I think most of the people in this thread are just touting Donald ahead of Watt in general.
I agree its Donald, but lets not act like Watt 2014 isnt the single greatest season by any player since Lawrence Taylor
A 3-tech interior lineman to a 3-4 end, they are similar positions, both play with an edge on the outside in passing downs.
Entertainment factor.   Awesome watching this 6'5" 288 pound freak mossing DBs lmao
Yeah, the more you expand the comparison the more uneven it looks.
If Aaron Donald played in the 70's, he would have won an MVP like Alan Page. I absolutely believe he's one of the greatest players to ever play
Lol spoken by someone who very clearly did not watch peak JJ Watt. The Patriots used to practice for him by having people wave fucking brooms over the line of scrimmage as Tom Brady tried to throw passes.
People always talk about pass rushers and shutdown corners, but having elite linebackers is a huge luxury on a defense. Guys that can diagnose pre snap, cover, fly through gaps to stop run plays for little/no gain, rush when needed and fly sideline to sideline washing out ballcarriers.  Keuchly and Davis were a nasty pair for you guys. We had the privilege of Willis and Bowman during that same time. Although the pair we have now ain't to shabby either.
Ya hes defs on a bit of the whacky tobacky
I don't think you're crazy to suggest it. A lot of people have reservations to anointing new players into all time great lists because of their fond memories, but I'm 100% confident that when it's all said and done for Donald, he would be viewed in the same light. What sets the greats apart is how you're viewed next to your peers. LT's only competition was Reggie White and they're both easily top 3 defenders of all time. I believe Aaron Donald had no peer to match him in his prime. Maybe JJ Watt would have if he was healthy
Maybe I haven't seen enough RAMs games but I don't see him as the game wrecker that LT was. I would take Miles Garrett over AD.
Respectfully, fuck outta here.
>	AD is a bigger freak of nature than LT   false. How old are you? I’m guessing under 30 and never saw LT play? LT > Donald. And Donald is in my top five favorite rams ever
No, put him higher up on it.
Because he’s a panthers fan lol
BWagz definitely was the better tackler. Keuchly might have had more speed and better instincts, but when Wagner got there, the play was finished, no questions asked
I mean the TFLs are to be expected as he plays OLB not ILB.  but yeah those FFs are absolutely ridiculous
The rams are our daddy
JJ Watt played for a bad Texans team and was absolutely elite, the best overcome their situation. Mack clearly isn’t the better player, even if he had an elite season. Almost every aspect supports Von or Mack.
I think you're forgetting positions. Yeah Watt has better stats. He *should,* they don't play the same positions. 20.5 sacks is an all-time season for an edge.  20.5 sacks for an IDL is video game shit.
Similar peaks (3 of 4 years are DPOY)  But Donald was way healthier for longer. And had 7 AP1's to Watt's 4.  And Donald is still going
Ahhh good point  Edit: Fuck I feel old
He was one of if not the greatest free safety to ever play the game. But in his last season he was not very good. Both statements can be true.
That's literally the only result on Google that isn't forks and it solely redirects to the word trophy instead. I refuse to believe people say that.  I'm on to you.
You believe silverware is a term used more often for sports trophies than cutlery?
Yup, most English football fans refer to trophies as such
>I have never heard anyone in the US use silverware this way before this thread.
Live for New Year’s Eve. Sloppy steaks at Trufonni’s.
Yup, it was Kam. Back to back FG attempts.
Harrison Smith can do everything and absolutely deserves the HOF. Him and Kevin Williams.
I think JJ also played the 5 tech pending the situation but as a whole your point is definitely valid.
Watt's best plays actually came when he lined up [outside the tackle box](https://youtu.be/OthuWuLkLTI)  Fr though for basically the entirety of his peak, the narrative around JJ was that he lined up wherever the fuck he wanted to. Players have come out and talked openly about this too -- he goes wherever he wants and the other 10 guys have to adjust.  Through the first four years of his career, he took about [4x as many snaps at EDGE than he did inside the tackles](https://www.espn.com/blog/houston-texans/post/_/id/8581/the-many-places-j-j-watt-lines-up). Even in his final season in Houston, he took [over 700 snaps at EDGE and less than 100 at end (different from EDGE)](https://www.behindthesteelcurtain.com/2021/2/15/22280505/j-j-watt-would-be-a-perfect-fit-for-the-pittsburgh-steelers-defense-t-j-watt-derek-watt).  Calling Watt a 34DE is like calling Troy Polamalu a box safety or calling CMC a third down RB
Watt has played 3 more seasons lmao. Also using tackles as evidence of anything is the most casual take ever
It definitely is a feather in his cap, wtf. If you can get an interior guy who gets sacks like donald you keep him there, because its so rare, and easier to find outside guys who can get sacks. Youd have to be an idiot to move him outside.
Because...he's older than donald? lol
You're getting downvotes but that's correct.
He plays ILB. He was OLB before 2019 but he was still an off ball LB, not an edge.
During the 2016 season we only won two games. I made 2 bets all year that the 49ers would win. $50 each. It was against my Rams fan friend. So the season we only won twice, I won both bets I made all season against the same team. Even when the 49ers suck, they are the Rams daddy. Haha.
I mean, Watt had 20.5 twice, he had 39 tackles for loss and 16 passes defensed in one season. He had over 50 QB hits in two different seasons. If anyone has video game numbers, it’s him.  People acting like Donald is the only good 3-tech rusher ever are ignorant. Yes, 20.5 sacks is an ungodly number. He never had more than 13.5 in another season. Keith Millard had 18 one season. Warren Sapp had 16 one season. John Randle had 15.5. Hell Chris Jones had 15.5 two different seasons.   During his best seven-year stretch, Donald had 89 sacks. John Randle had 85.5. His dominance from the interior is overblown. He’s the best, but people act like he’s the only defensive tackle who’s ever registered a sack before.   Donald has been markedly better than John Randle, Warren Sapp, and any other interior rusher, and that really is saying something, but he’s not JJ Friggin’ Watt.
You can’t just look at 3 DPOYs and call them equal. JJ’s DPOY years are arguably the best 3 years a defender has ever had.
Lol, yeah. Someone else in the thread said Revis has been retired for 5 seasons…that’s unbelievable.
As a Brit silverware is common when referring to trophies in Football ‘soccer’. Is also used for forks and knives aswell though.
This is 100% what trophies are referred to in soccer.

People definitely say silverware in this context.
When did the comment you were replying to specify US? So because one country doesn't use it regularily it doesn't make it a common term despite being used regularily in the most popular sport in the world?
Yeah that is the reality, he was so dominant he almost didn’t have a position and moved around the line and was a wrecking ball wherever he played. Again, that’s not some knock on him, Watt’s the only guy who could do that, Donald included.
Watt has better numbers than Donald in every category.
It’s easier to get 12.5 sacks from the interior than it is to get 39 TFL and 16 PDs from the edge because the second part has only happened once in history.
Which means Donald hasn’t actually proven he’s more durable than Watt yet.
Story of my r/nfl life.
Lol. Same. We could go 14/2 and those 2 losses could have been against the 2/14 rams lol. And they would have owned us. I’m pretty sure the rams built their team specifically around stopping us. Only us. Cause they sucker vs everyone else
And after that he did nothing. This isn't highest peak, it's who had the best decade.  After his 3rd DPOY, here's what watt did:  2016 - 3 games played, 1.5 sacks  2017 - 5 games played, 0 sacks  2018 - All Pro, 16 sacks  2019 - 8 games, 4 sacks  2020 - 16 games, 5 sacks  2021 - 7 games, 1 sack  2022 - 16 games, 12.5 sacks.  &#x200B;  In that time span, Aaron Donald won 3 DPOYs and 7 1st Team All Pros.
Luke retired in 2019...4 years ago. God everything feels so whacked up from Covid lol
> When did the comment you were replying to specify US?   Should it really need to? We’re in /r/nfl, a subreddit dedicated to a sport that’s centered in the US and specifically to a league that exists only in the US. A huge portion of the world also speaks French but we don’t have disclaimers here saying “most discussions will occur in English.”
I did. My comment specified that I had never seen it in US sports. So unless you have an example of that, you haven't contradicted anything I said.  Edit: the person I made my original reply to totally fucking did imply it was used in the US, and that was what I responded to. They said "Popular in the uk *TOO* I think" (emphasis mine). What is the meaning of that "too" if they aren't saying it's used here?
What? Aaron Donald has missed like 3 games in his entire career while Watt has missed 42 in just his past 6 seasons.
It’s not who had the best decade. It’s best NFL defenders *of* the last decade and for 3 years, that was JJ Watt and it’s not close. And Donald’s extra great years do make up that gap, but the degree to which they close the gap is arguably not enough to bring him above JJ due to the all-time greatness of the peak.
But if Donald retired tomorrow he’d have played an entire season less than JJ Watt. He’s got to play the games to get credit for them.
Donald is the better player of the last 10 years and career. Take off the homer goggles.
They both had 3 DPOYs in 4 Years.  You are clearly just a Texans homer.
How is 12 tds Alabama record for all time tds for tight ends lol
A quality TE2 would be nice
Panthers could take Young at #1 and then maybe add his college TE later on
Coming from a Tide fan, don’t play him in clutch moments. Wide open to seal a game, he’s 100% going to drop it. Q1-3? He’s alright.
49ers, you are really good as a tight end but what do you think about being a permanent blocker.
I’m an Alabama fan and I watched him play every game.  Latu is an interesting TE. I never saw him make huge catches or gain lots of yards after the catch, he was the definition of average on a loaded team. Lots of his touchdowns came from a “right place at the right time” situation as he wasn’t our biggest redzone threat. I actually remember disliking his play at some point because he dropped a LOT of balls.  I’d be surprised if he goes earlier than the 4th round. He’ll need a few seasons to work on his route running and hands before he can be a solid TE.
They don’t often use them. OJ Howard was a unicorn of a prospect that just never had the counting stats.   I still think initial landing spot + injuries fucked his career up. But yeah either way.  Wonder if teams are starting to recognize that TEs generally don’t do well on their first contract so you might as well just go buy one when the time comes
I guess they are not considering Ozzie Newsome as a TE (16 career tds).
The 9ers really don’t pass the ball with enough volume + have a lot of options to spread the ball to (Aiyuk, Kittle, CMC, Deebo, and then also Jennings).  So even if they had a decent TE2 I don’t feel like that TE would get much buzz on the 9ers.
He could maybe develop into one if you have a good coaching staff. As a Bama fan I’m not thrilled about him as a prospect. When he’s good he’s pretty good, but he has a drop problem, and he tends to disappear for long stretches. Not a bad project pick in the 4th/5th IMO, but he could go higher if someone likes his size and potential
Someone that can actually chip a pass rusher, preferably
hoping for Zack Kuntz as a developmental prospect. with our coaching staff he has some ridiculous potential at doing everything you could want a TE to do
Coming from a Cowboys fan, that's discouraging as any defense will triple team Ceedee in that situation and we're boned lol
Kittle was known to drop a ton of passes and have brick hands when we got him, so I think we have the coaching staff to develop him if we get him
Cowboys pick it is.
OJ Howard in Bama regular season games: invisible  OJ Howard in Bama national championship games: Literally God   Seriously like half his career college production was in a natty
Really only 3 TE's I'd take right now factoring in their contracts. Kelce, Kittle, Andrews.  Whereas there's 15-20 receivers I'd like on their current contracts.
> Wonder if teams are starting to recognize that TEs generally don’t do well on their first contract  Which makes it all the more surprising that there were two TEs from Iowa drafted in the first round a few years back.
Eh Kittle misses games every year and the backups aren’t anything but journeymen  A TE2 with some upside would be nice
Purdy definitely passed the ball a lot and became a pass-first offense.
He wasn't very physical and also only a so so athlete.  So he didn't block great, didn't get off jams well, and then got the dropsies.  Not a great combo.
Brandon Cooks should be a good WR2, and moving Gallup back to WR3 as well as being another year removed from his ACL injury should help tbf   I really like Jake Ferguson anyway
Yeah that sounds like a typical investment
I was about to suggest Goedert, but his contract is crazy backloaded - ~1m a year until 2024, when it jumps to 14m
To be fair, Kittle had just exploded from that same offense and Iowa loves to use their TEs. Hockenson has been pretty decent. Haven't followed Fant much so don't know how good he is.
In fairness, hockenson was supposed to be generational and complete, and fant was like some unicorn pitts-esc prospect.  They weren’t crazy picks at the time
In Purdy’s 8 starts (that he played most of the game) he averaged ~27.5 attempts per game. That’s 29th in the NFL for attempts per game. Hell, it’s below the 49ers. They threw the ball more with Jimmy.
Ohhhhhhhhh iswydt
*sees post about ownership  *Knows we are the answer every time
I want my team to lift the Lombardi but I sure as hell don't wanna see dumbass Bidwill doing it
“Good” is relative here but for owners who the NFL owes some gratitude for their contributions to the sport, I’m looking at the Davis family (Raiders), and the Rooneys (Steelers).   Mr. Snyder can fuck right off. Dean Spanos* can fuck right off. The Bidwells can fuck right off.
Shad Kahn.  Immigrated to the states.  Built an empire from the ground up.  Employs a progressive business model (the Toyota way) that centers around investing in your employees and partners to achieve long term success instead of short sighted profit chasing.   For a rich dude, I think he’s probably an awesome guy.
Man, I think after everything Sheila Ford has done for the lions, man, after taking over, she deserves a win, she’s the best, man I can’t talk about how good she is man, man, man she’s just as tough of an owner that you’ll find out there man
They are all assholes, some have just leaked out worse than others.
Gotta say Steelers. Hate the fans, but respect the team
Technically the Packers, because my parents are "stock owners", and they're great.  However if you consider that a BS answer because the stock is meaningless and treat Mark Murphy as the "owner", since he's the team president, then we deserve much less success because he blows and also has atrocious [teeth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mark_Murphy_2016_(cropped).jpg)  I don't know enough about other owners to make a judgement.  Raiders maybe deserve the least because of Mark Davis' shitty haircut.
As a Fin Fan I will say I hate our owner
I have to go with the Steelers because I can't say Minnesota. But Minnesota does have the best player rating of any team in the league. Best facilities, food, staff. Players have it pretty good in MN.
Fuck all of the owners  Especially the ones who build stadiums with taxpayer money.
If you forget about the blowy, and focus on all of the charity Robert Kraft has done it kinda balances the scales? Right?   …..right?
Nobody that can afford to own an NFL franchise deserves success.
I feel like George mccaskey and his mom are genuinely good folks but since I can’t vote for them I would say the Vikings
[removed]
Don’t really know the owners like that… but probably the Rooneys.  With that being said, Jim Irsay has his past, and is cooky as hell… but seems like a legitimately good dude. Hell, he just saved a whale 😂.
The lack of the Chargers and Dean Spanos in the comments is surprising
Giants deserve the most success.  Browns deserve the least success.  Giants because fuck you.  Browns because rapist.
this thread really makin me appreciate our ownership.
FUCK SPANOS!
Every time I see that picture of Arthur Blank looking dejected on the sideline I get big sad. Seems like a solid guy for a billionaire.
I’ve seen posts with the falcons but Arthur Blank needs a specific shoutout. My Aunt was involved in an accident in a Home Depot (part of the reason that all Home Depot’s block off aisles when using lifts) and Arthur blank personally visited her in the hospital. He truly is a good man and he and Home Depot have taken care of everything she has needed in her life.
If we're talking about the billionaire owners who exploited workers, tax payers, and God knows who else to get to where they are; then none deserve success.
Obvious bias but I love the Rooneys and Browns/Commanders are the obvious choices to duck off
I’m far too biased to even begin to contemplate this question. “Good things for bengals, bad things for Steelers” is really the only thing that computes, even though logically I should wish worse things on the Browns right now.
The packers for both
Say what you want about jerry but he takes care of his guys. Zeke contract was no good from a business standpoint but maybe jerry just wanted to reward his guy.
The Chiefs for drafting Patrick Mahomes
Broncos deserve the most success & the Rams the least so that the Walton family gatherings will always stay spicy, even if they switch the Sam’s choice cola to Diet flavor.   I have no real answer
Steelers seem to take care of their players.  Seahawks cut Bobby Wagner, earl Thomas some dumb shit
*"Deserves got nothing to do with it."*
Most: Detroit  Least: Browns
Most Deserving: Green Bay Packers, Inc (Despite the stock being the biggest scam ever, publicly funding a team in a city that has nothing outside said team is pretty cool); Robert Kraft (Despite hating the Pats dynasty the man is a hands on owner who bothers to interact with the players and defers football decisions to his HoF Coach/GM)  Least Deserving: Dan Snyder (Probably the biggest 5 Tool Deutschbag we will ever see own a sports team - cheap, has strong cases against him as being racist and sexist, and to top off this shit sundae he is meddlesome to team activity to the point he has literally set them back years with his input); Michael Bidwell (Nepo Baby who took over his dad that has owned the team since '32 but hasn't won a title since Truman, and his team has lacked any success until the mid 2000s)
Packers for both.
Rooney family wins hands down--fair and just
We had the best owner until a few years ago.  Now we have a mostly absentee owner who isn't that great of a person based on news reports (sexual harassment of body guards, smuggling) that is supposed to be preparing to sell the team but has shown no indications of it occurring.  I think I'd go with Sheila Hamp for deserving the most success.  She was a college athlete who wanted to stay in the sports business and dealt with a ton of misogyny.  Now she has the team and has her chance.  So far she's done an amazing job turning around the Lions, and I hope it continues.  Honestly, the Detroit fans deserve it too.  Worst... It has to be Snyder or Haslem.  The list of awfulness is just huge for both.  Sex trafficking your employees, illegally cutting down a forest on public lands for your view, keeping 2 sets of books to hide revenue, stealing from your biggest customers, signing a 26+ time sexual assaulter to the largest guaranteed contract, and a whole raft of other fun that I can't even remember because honestly the list is just too long.
I mean, the Browns deserve the suffering they’re about to experience over the next 5 years for signing a sexual predator to an over the top fully guaranteed deal, handcuffing themselves at every other position.  I’d love to see the Bills keep having success.  Especially if Hamlin makes a comeback.
Most: Steelers, Falcons, Seahawks  Least: Washington, this should be the only answer.
Browns, Commies and Texans immediately jump to mind as those that don’t deserve an ounce of success. That’s following Stan Kroenke (fuck you).  If I had to pick an ownership group that sucked the least, probably the Packers due to them not being a private corporation. After that, probably the Rooneys.
By this standard, none of them deserve to win a game ever again, since they're all owned by a bunch of rich assholes.
One one hand all billionaires are basically shitty people. On the other hand, people are shitty in general so idk what's the question
I hate all the owners equally
This thread:      Browns no pass for SA QB.   Steelers pass for rapist QB.     r/nfl logic.
The one constant through all of the woes of the NY Jets for the last 23 years...
Lions
Packers most.
Most success: Sheila Ford Hamp has done a lot to turn the Lions around the last few years, and she clearly cares about building a good culture that translates to a good on-field product.   Least success: in my biased fandom opinion, the Haslams. I love Cleveland. I love the Browns. I want Chubb & Garrett to get rings. I don't want the Haslams to succeed. Their constant interference, lack of long-term vision, and attempts to take shortcuts have driven the team into the ground
Prior to his death, Pat Bowlen of the Broncos was a fantastic owner.
Surprised I don’t see more Robert Kraft mentions here.
KC has recent success, but the Hunt family doesn’t seem too awful. Plus Clark Hunt’s daughter is a 10.
I don’t worship billionaires.
In terms of rooting against the Browns are up there for signing a predator as well as the Commanders.  Rooting for I couldn't give a single fuck what billionaire owner wins a ring. If i'm not rooting for my own team it usually comes down to players I like and that's it.
Lions deserve the least success because they forced the greatest running back of all time to retire instead of trading him to a contender
The only team whose ownership deserves success is the Packers. Every other team is owned by at least one billionaire, and every billionaire is a shithead who should not exist (billionaires, that is) in the first place. The only way someone gets that wealthy is by exploiting people and/or the environment.
I can tell you who deserves the least: the Rams
Most success: Patriots, Steelers, etc.  Least Success: Whatever the owner(s) of the Falcons, Panthers, Redskins, etc., are doing.
John Mara shows every once in a while that he's just a football nepo baby but pretty good overall. But the organization always makes it a point to (at least try) help its former players succeed post football.
None of them deserve anything. They’re making money hand over fist for something that requires very little work, many of them have primary jobs as CEOs that take up much more of their time  If we want to talk about players, coaches, fanbases who deserve success that’s a different discussion
Least - Snyder  Most - packers owners cuz they aren't billionaires
They’re all owned by billionaires. I don’t think any of them are owned by good people lol. Especially Kroenke despite my bias
Packers most, the rest are just billionaires, and don't thinknyou can be a good person if you are that rich.
I think it’s pretty easy to say who deserves the least success
I'm really let down by the Browns. Specifically the signing of Watson and the guaranted money, it sets the bar really high for other teams. I mean I'm happy people are getting paid but a little frustrated Deshawn Watson paved the way....you know what I mean, like couldn't it have been someone who's really put in the work.  For success in my opinion the Bengals are doing it right it seems. Good fundamentals, solid offense and defense, they have a really good balance. Nobody is really a huge star either. Statistically the roster is doing really well but to me that's due to a solid team effort, and a good playbook.
Jeff Lurie. Dude is a tool and a complete moron. They make bad inputs but pull miracles out the ass. Even then they hover in mediocrity except on occasion.
Least: Browns. Kroenke too.  Most: Don't care, they all have more money than I'll ever see in my lifetime. They already have "success".
Whoever buys the commanders deserves the most simply for getting it away from Dan
If it worked like this: I'd just like to know who we pissed off?
Honestly the chiefs and im a die hard raiders fan
I would like to see the commies win a Super Bowl the year after Snyder sells
I don’t know if their good people, but I like how the Steelers aren’t a HC carousel.
I mean talking just owners not fan base? Cleveland's and Washington's owners never deserve a title, their fans maybe not.
steelers imo.
Commanders and Cardinals deserve it the least. Seems to be the bottom of a terrible fermented shit barrel, as far as NFL teams go. I say the Lions deserve it the most (fans wise)
Chargers should be a dumpster fire forever. To move a team is one thing, to move it to the most hated rival city is just disgusting.
Green bay soley because the city owns it
The ownership that deserves the least success is our current owner.  The ownership that deserves the most success is whoever our next owner is.  There is no bigger middle finger to Snyder than the next owners immediately turning the team he destroyed into a championship team.
Success: The Steelers.  2 coaches in 20 years and Tomlin is a fucking machine breaking .500.  Even when they are bad they aren't that bad.  Worst: Woody Johnson.  It's not close.  The Browns and Commanders ownership is terrible but the Jets have been fucking putrid and the Johnsons are just born fucking losers.    Purely based on football.  The Jets have arguably the worst ownership in pro sports.  They can't win shit and paid a billion dollars (MetLife was 2 billion 13 years ago) to share a stadium in a different state.  And it's worse than its predecessor which was rowdy as fuck.
Most: Sheila   Least: WCF/Martha
Sheila Ford. I promise I’m not biased. She really loves the team and wants to see a change in culture. Gotta say she is doing a damn good job. She reminds me of Rebecca from Ted Lasso.
I think the clear answer for ownership that is responsible for their teams lack of success is the Spanos family..   leaving SD was a mistake. Say what you will about Philip rivers, some of those chargers teams had multiple hall of famers on both sides of the ball and could never get it done.   They’re now going to waste a potential hall of fame talent in justin Herbert because they’re too cheap to tell Staley to kick rocks and go out and pay a real head coach.
Lurie is the man. Class act (as far as we know lol)
I feel like the lions should have a better history than they do. Matt S should’ve taken them to the Super Bowl at least once
I don't have a "most" but I think least is a head to head battle between the browns and commanders
you don’t have to ask me to remove my random lol
Even though I'm not a fan of the McCaskey's, but i'd like us to win one more ring for Virginia before she shuffles off her mortal coil in honour of her Dad and Papa Bear himself
Deserve has got nothing to do with it
Honestly the Wilfs are pretty great as far as NFL owners go. Hands off enough that coaches can do their thing, hands on enough to toss out coaches who are past their expiration date, they don’t say stupid garbage all the time, they are pretty decent. I suppose I don’t know what the high bar for owners looks like, but I know what the low bar looks like (mr Snyder you sonofabitch), and they clear that bar by a long shot.
Mike Brown was a terrible owner, cheap and  stubborn, stuck in the past, etc. But by all accounts he is a very nice person. Same with Katie and the rest of the family. So now that Katie is basically our de-facto owner I think she deserves the success we are currently having. She is also a big reason for it since taking over as our FO has completely changed, for the better.   But if I have to pick another team, I'll go with the Bears since the Mccaskeys seem like nice people.
Any owner that overrules the coach and makes them jump the gun on a QB doesn’t deserve a franchise
Keep seeing Minnesota and Detroit. I know we all love the Lions or at least no one hates them, but didn't they boo their owner last time she spoke at the stadium or something?  FWIW, Jed York comes off as an annoying trust fund kid but to my recollection hasn't done anything shady like most owners seem to have done. So that's a plus lol. But a part of me feels like he gets teased at family gatherings for not having a ring yet while uncle Eddie's walking around with his five. So maybe get Jed one and end his pretended suffering haha.
I’m pretty blessed as a Titans fan that the Haslams don’t own this team at least.
**Bills**. The Pegulas have been through... *\*a lot\** this past season, and have really shown love and dedication to the city of Buffalo, even through the worst of it. That's aside from my fandom. On the flipside, also aside from my fandom, **Carolina** has deserved\* the least because FUCK TEPPER. Dude did Cam, Ron, and Greg so dirty when he came in, then made some highly questionable hires. But- he's made some major improvements this off-season, so we'll see how long the general (nearly universal) hatred for him lasts.
Arthur Blank and the Atlanta Falcons. Since buying the team from the Smith family, he has done everything to bring a solid and winning team. The only unfortunate thing is having a administration that has given him bad advice in the past. His latest hires appear to have the team in the right direction. Being a fan over the years has been frustrating and the hope is we will soon have the team he and us fans have been hoping for.
I like Ford and McCaskey but tbh no billioaires "deserve" anything.  Packers don't have a billionaire owner so them by default.
I know I'm supposed to remove my Fandom. But the mccaskeys are nice AND they can fuck right off. They seem like good people, but Virginia has brought decades of mediocrity, to a once proud franchise, due to nepotism
Our time shall come...eventually...hopefully...who knows? :'(
Most? Probably Shad. Least? The Danimal.
Kraft is a really solid dude, deserves everything he’s gotten
I want the Browns to win a Super Bowl
Obvious Bias: Jed York used to be one of the worst CEO’s in the league. The way he managed the disaster of the 49ers Franchise after Harbaugh’s departure was putrid and how he very well could have started all the drama in the first place. York moronically compared Tomsula to Steve Kerr. But in recent years, Lynch and Shanahan have trended the team back in the right direction. How much credit York and Gideon Yu should get, is your to you. But I hated him in the early 2010’s and especially during the 2016 disaster class. He’s better now than he was then at least. Wouldn’t be mad if he finally hoisted the Lombardi with the team.
I mean, the browns are REALLY giving the commies a run for their money. Haven’t overtaken the commies, but it’s getting closw
Relax brother our nightmare is almost over.
Off topic I know, but every time I see the Commanders, I think who the hell are they.  Then, oh, yeah, okay.
Oh no. No.   The Browns deserves every black scenario that can possibly happen in a football season.
It really is an atrocious experience seeing some fucking billionaire fucknut up there pretending like they earned that superbowl
you have no worries.
At this point I don't give a shit if the ownership is made up of Hitler, Dahmer and Thanos as long as they are lifting up a Lombardi.  I dunno about most,  but the Lion ownership could use some, they seem to actually care about winning.
I would be happy if the Cardinals finally won. I do not want to see Bidwell succeed though.
I feel like you have to include the Maras in there, too. They’re literally cousins with the Rooneys and without them the NFL probably isn’t anything like what it grew to become.
The Haslems can fuck right off too
I respect Al Davis for what he did, but at the same time fuck him for starting the relocation boom that cost a bunch of cities their teams.
Kroenke too. Makes sense he won with OBJ, since both bitched out of their previous locations.  The Haslams too.
Eh, I mean Al Davis may have been an asshole to people who deserved it, but he was still an asshole.
Jags are killing it  Losers: cowboys, commanders, broncos
I want him to win one for the mustache alone
My boss was mentored by him, she has nothing but positive things to say about him as a person and role model
Ah I found Dan Campbell’s Reddit account
I‘m fired up about Sheila Ford man.
Says the guy in the division with the most asshole leakage in the league.
I legitimately believe Lurie is a relatively genuine person.
No such thing as ethical Billionaires for sure. I think it's really funny how people are trying to push that Bidwill is at the same level as Snyder and Haslam. He's just incompetent at running a team (beyond typical billionaire asshole stuff). Otherwise he's highly regarded by the NFL owners for hosting SBs, the owners meeting in AZ and being part of the diversity committee and many other things. Just because he's bad at his current job and it makes fans upset because they want him to win, that doesn't put him immediately into category with "signs a rapist" and "is a rapist (sexual assaulter? whatever word you want to use to describe Snyder)"
I don't think every single billionaire is a pile of shit. Warren Buffet has done nothing to suggest he's a terrible person, for one. And even among the piles of shit there are very clear gradations.
Steelers owners are great. Friend did work for them and they invited him to a game in their box, he invited me down for the game. Art Rooney 2 was very nice to us, talked my buddy about his business and some other stuff. In the process Art found out that my buddy did similar work for the bengals and that the bengals hadn’t paid my friend yet (several months). Art made a call during the game and not 15 minutes later someone from the bengals contacted my friend to send the payment.
What the heck Mark Davis is a great guy he lets homeless dogs cut his hair for charity
You are saying Mark Davis while Dan Snyder still owns a team in the league?
Yo the teeth got me lol
But your parents are packers fans, so they must be bad people
Is Mark Murphy really that bad of an “owner?” Or is he just not as good as Packers “owners” of decades past?
I love that it boils down to bad teeth and bad hair.
Didn’t he finally shave his head?
The Rooneys are good they pioneered NFL inclusion and like ambassadors to Ireland or whatever
murphy doesnt look like a guy played safety in nfl
Our owners are good owners tbh. Def not the most deserving but I would think they would be in the top ten. The Wilfs have a kinda shady past in the business world but as nfl owners they’ve been pretty good. I love seeing them dancing with the players in the locker room after a big win.
You know, apart from the fact that they live in MN.  Source: From Wisconsin, so I'm ever so slightly closer to what most Coast dwellers consider an actual destination in Chicago.
Then the winter hits
And threaten to sell and move the team if the tax payers won’t do it after they were praised for saving the team….
Packers excluded
Robert Kraft was a die-hard fan and season ticket holder who bought a team that was complete dogshit and a laughing stock with the possibility of relocation looming. Within 5-ish years, they made a Super Bowl. Within 10, they had started a dynasty that will probably never be seen again.
I don't give a fuck about sex work. Decriminalize it
I’m surprised how many people give a shit if someone gets a consensual sex act for money.  Who cares?  I live in Colorado and every now and then Gary Hart shows his face.  People still jeer him about his infidelity from 40 years ago.
The pure balls it took using the team jet to smuggle PPE past the Trump administration's blockade during the height of Covid won my respect.
I knew Packers fans didn't deserve success
Flair does not check out.
Shad (Shahid) Khan is literally what the American dream is about.   The man went from being a 16 year old immigrant from Pakistan working as a dishwasher in 1967 to a billionaire worth 12.1 billion.  He earned his success, he definitely wasn't born into it or married into it.  https://www.jacksonville.com/story/sports/nfl/2011/12/04/shahid-khan-has-true-rags-riches-american-story/987238007/
Did I wander into /r/antiwork?
Common Reddit take
I agree in principle but owners who inherited their teams aren't really to blame for whatever came before them. And no one, let alone any of us would ever turn down that kind of money and the chance to own an NFL franchise.
What about Kim pegula , owner of the buffalo bills?   "Pegula was born in Seoul, South Korea. She reportedly has no recollection of her birth name and no record of her biological parents nor any account of her life in South Korea, only her date of birth, a secondhand account of being abandoned in the streets of Seoul at the age of five"   And then just recently....  "Kim Pegula's hospitalization was due to her having gone into cardiac arrest, which progressed into a "brain injury" leading to "significant expressive aphasia and significant memory issues" due to the prolonged lack of oxygen to her brain"  She may have married into wealth but I definitely wouldn't say she's had an easy life and deserves anything that comes her way.   Also, she seems super nice and humble.
>Nobody that can afford to own an NFL franchise deserves success.  What about the people who are rich *because* they own an NFL franchise (The Mara's)
Whata cringe take
What if you inherited it and it’s your main source of income?
What an absurd and childish view. You must have an extremely warped view of what "deserves" means.
Eat the Rich Gannons
This is the only right answer
The only time a packers fan be spittin.   Fuck billionaires. They're all pigs.
Yeah I'd love to have Virginia see one. George is as far as I can tell from the internet a great dude just maybe not the best owner in terms of football decisions, he should have canned Ted Phillips so long ago. I like that we got Kevin Warren now, though.  I feel like these old school football familes are the "most deserving". Rooneys, Davis', Halas/McCaskeys, Mara's.
[removed]
Irsay was randomly giving away tickets to our super bowl for our fans last year, I like him.
Hey I included him with Dan Snyder and the Bidwells
The AFC North must always have 1 rapist, no more, no less.
This is so weird, seeing the Browns with the rapist QB. I’m so used to the Steelers having that
I mean, Jody Allen was just related to a dude who did all that. And I think she leaves the company to run with little oversight and only does philanthropy? (Rich people philanthropy, not give away your money and end child hunger philanthropy).  I’d give her a B+  But maybe she ultra sucks and I just don’t know.
Dan Rooney honestly might have been one of the best sports owners of all time. the first year he had control over the team he hired Chuck Noll and Bill Nunn, and all 3 of the HC's he hired in his career turned out to be HOFers
Rooney's are largely the right answer.
Never thought I'd agree with a Bengals fan.
Everyone seemed to like Paul Allen but since he died idk how I even feel about our ownership lol
Detroit fans deserve it. Owners can f right off for fasting so many great talents and so many opportunities.
I mean I get hating all the owners, but equally? some of them definitely deserve to be hated more than others
I know nothing about the Jets ownership.  Salem is a great coaching hire but before that, why have they ‘performed below playoff expectations’ since the 2010?
Terrible owner after he passed. Never returned calls or emails. It's like he just disappeared
The Browns were the lovable underdog until they sold their soul to the devil. Kind of like that uncle that just got out of rehab but then gets a dui two weeks later.
I heard they had a good WR once too, and he retired early.
The Bengals also have a rapist on their team
You are bad at opinions.
That’s not it
They just paid a rapist. Our owner probably IS a rapist. There's levels to this 😤
They really aren't. They paid a lot of money to someone who probably sexually assaulted a lot of people. Dan Snyder probably blatantly traffic many women.
From a football-only standpoint, I think the Haslems are worse. I guess they do have that one playoff win, but still.
I saw the Browns were being sold and got my hopes up for the sake of a forsaken fanbase, and then I saw it was a gas station guy.
For me the difference is that Snyder is going to be forced out. It's only a matter of time by this point. I don't think the Browns ownership is going anywhere.
*Inb4 Dan Snyder makes an Arte Moreno-esque announcement to say he's not selling the team and the rest of the owners are just okay with it ^^/s*
Hockey does it best
Seeing Mike Brown on the field being presented the Lamar Hunt trophy knowing the absolute hell he put the Bengals through for thirty years was something else.
Eh, they’re sometimes the ones responsible for hiring important team officials. Or in Dallas Jerry Jones is directly responsible for the Cowboys winning/losing because he makes significant football decisions.   If I was the Owner of a team you better bet I’d be the GM as well.
Lol these are the kind of the fans that allow Deshaun to get signed to an insane contract
I thought about the Maras also but if I’m being 100% transparent I left them off because I don’t like the Giants *but I also agree with you
I read your comment and my brain went, "Rooney Mara, lol". Then I looked up the actress and holy shit, she's the granddaughter of both founders.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooney_Mara
Flair checks out.
Yeah I’m kinda conflicted on that one. I hate to see teams relocate but I also love to see Al Davis stick it to the Commissioner
Shad Khan is likable as an owner without much going against him other than bad coach and GM hires until finally getting it right.   I can’t argue against your picks too much but I am curious about the Broncos inclusion. Are we talking about the new ownership group, or the Bowlens?
Agreed. Also, as a supply chain guy his innovations with bumpers is pretty neat.   https://www.forbes.com/sites/briansolomon/2012/09/05/shahid-khan-the-new-face-of-the-nfl-and-the-american-dream/amp/
He should probably see a doctor about that
You don’t become a billionaire without being a morally bankrupt piece of shit. It’s a fair statement.
If we’re talking actual [asshole leakage](https://www.si.com/.amp/nfl/2021/09/12/washington-football-team-fans-water-leak-fedex-field-sewage) cowboys are a distant second. If you’re talking about metaphorical [asshole](https://slate.com/culture/2022/10/dan-snyder-washington-commanders-sell-team-owners-hate-him.html) leakage, Dallas is closer but still not leading the division
I mean… *gestures at the Browns*
Yeah so my man knows what he's talking about!
Nah Lamar carries the AFC North
Gonna have to disagree.  Reasoning: Teams in our division have produced Culverhouse, Richardson, and the Saints owners.
Stop making me like the Steelers
It's the little things. Whenever the Steelers eat at training camp or the practice facility, the Rooneys stand in the same line for food as the players and coaches. They don't necessarily "go first."
I’m critical of Art for some of his more conservative practices (letting coach contracts run down rather than firing them when needed, running one of the lighter coaching staffs in the league, etc) but it’s hard to dislike him outside of that.  The Rooney’s, as far as owners go, are solid people.
Real life Lloyd Christmas.
In my defense, I haven't seen Dan Snyder's haircut or teeth.
All that money.... and he's sticking with those? 😂
Good dig, but they're legitimately great.  They're retired these days and I've inherited their tickets and have their stock certificate framed in my basement.  But I genuinely had the types of parents most people would be envious of growing up.  Caring, interested, but not overbearing.  Fostered independence.  Trusted us.  Checked in on us.  Pretty much all of the good with almost none of the bad.
Good question. In sincerity, it's mostly just that he's not Bob Harlan.  Harlan was beloved.  He was a great President, and a good man. We like his son, too.   Bob Harlan was like the owner of a business in a small town.  Everyone knows him, he's successful but still a part of the community.  Takes care of folk.    Mark Murphy is like the CEO of a major national company, like a Kohls or a Best Buy or something.  They're probably "qualified", but all of the employees talk shit about them, most people in the public don't know who they are, and they make a lot of questionable decisions to prove they are worth their huge salaries.
I actually hope not.  I hate his shitty haircut but I love his commitment to it.
It was just photoshop pics that got spread around. He was seen at a recent boxing even and still had his national treasure trademark bowl cut.
No such thing as an ethical billionaire and I’m a Vikes fan, so I’m biased, but they do treat their employees really well and sink a ton of money into the community. They’re also committed to spending for a winner and retaining fan favorites. May be misguided at times but we could do much, much worse (see McCombs, Red).
They've been good owners of the team but they're not good people. https://observer.com/2014/09/the-broken-moral-compass-of-vikings-owners-mark-and-zygi-wilf/               Nfl ownership is just bad enough to make them look decent and they do a good job of staying out of the spotlight mostly.
Tell your people to stay out of Minnesota then :)
You know who winter sucks for? The homeless. Everyone else manages just fine.
Auughghhh true. But I gotta love the Pegulas still for (seriously) saving the team, and showing they really are dedicated to Buffalo (considering they also bought the Sabres, and yes minus the threats to move - which honestly I don't believe were serious).
I mean, think of the time investment alone... To fuck all those Wisconsinites? Plus, have you SEEN some of the beer guts on those fans?
It is one of those weird scenarios where the owner is somehow more likable than the team he built considering all the controversy around the Patriots
That’s one of the reasons I respect the Jazz owner. Dude grew up a Jazz fan and bought the team once he had enough capital - every fan’s dream
He also paid for his own stadium.
People should be in charge of their own bodies.   Honesty, the Browns (Bengals owners) probably are the most charitable owners and deserve more success. Joey B. Is a solid role model. All around solid organization  The Snyders or the Haslams are probably the least deserving, and the least admirable.
I appreciate all of the body positive comments. I wasn’t expecting this
This really is quite the self-own.
Disgusting corrupt working class trash - people like them are the reason why all teams should be owned by the honest, kind, generous, truthful saints that are the billionaires of the world
Flair really checks out are you kidding?
Even if I didn't exclude my team, the vast majority of shareholders also don't deserve success, but at least the barrier to entry is lower.
Doesn't mean it's wrong. Monstrous wealth is not attained in any good ways. The average nfl owner is worth billions, that's more money that you or I could make in 1000 lifetimes. It's insane
Ah yes the poor Mara’s who scraped by in poverty before inventing the NY Giants
Those who are wildly successful don't deserve it!  Also obviously people who are complete failures don't deserve that either!  Everyone should just be average, except for me because I deserve to be successful!

*Jackson Carman looking around nervously*
Now you have the tiny hands QB, live with it
> Jody Allen?  Listen, you have no idea. Blazers fans have been keeping track on r/NBA. It’s not pretty.
She ain’t bad; could be worse, like having Bezos.
Its jist weird like no point in cutting bobby last year  after trading russ, maybe treat your hall of farmers better, Ben sucked his last year and they went through that all year was awesome
If you are old enough to remember when he bought the team, you’ll understand why everyone liked him. If he hadn’t stepped in, it would have moved to California. Ken Bering had already moved the offices to Anaheim before the sale.
\*One owner. Fixed that for you. William Clay had no right to run an NFL Team. He ran the team the way Ford runs their ops. Buddy buddy. Shiela however is bucking that trend and making actual progress on changing the optics with the Detroit Lions management.
Trust us, as Packers fans, we know more team owners than you'll ever meet. Dude knows what he's talking about.
while they haven't won anything since 1969, they also weren't consistently horrible until the early 2010s so saying they sucked since the 70s feels like an exaggeration
You should have met his kids.  Holy shit those were some missed bullets.
Herman Moore?
Don't forget the organization basically institutionalized how to abuse their cheerleaders... Smfh
That’s why I said they’re giving them a run for their money, not just taking it outright lol
Ouch  The truth hurts.  Hope your shitty owner is replaced ASAP
Human trafficker too
Definitely*                This is reddit not a newspaper.  None of us need to do the alleged bullshit with sex trafficking scum like snyder.
Haslem also scammed like $50m from truckers. Paying a rapist isn't the only shitty thing he's done.
Since we’re talking *football*. Don’t forget his MLS cup lol
how does hockey do it?
I would have loved it if his daughter Katie had been the one to do that. She and the other family members have done more in like three years since he started to hand over the reins than he did in 30. And, no, it's not all due to Burrow - they've finally decided to join the FA market, have massively improved fan outreach, and made the game day experience an event beyond the game on the field...
But then if you suck you've doomed your franchise for decades  That's part of why Snyder's so terrible
Jerry has been making less and less decisions for a while now
Yeah, I'm not with this guy. The Bidwills to the best of our knowledge are more just incompetent at running a team and should likely take a step away from being Team president and VP and just go back to being normal asshole billionaires. It's on a completely different spectrum to the likes of Snyder and Haslam.
Flair aside, I don't want John Mara to have any success simply because of the taunting rule
Ha, fair enough. Appreciate the honesty.
Her and her sister.
Literally all flairs are right to tell the Haslams to fuck off
Browns fans should be telling the Haslams to fuck right off too if they had a shred of decency
He stole millions of dollars via fraud. He’s an asshole any way you slice it.
No one roots for Walmart
As a life long 49er fan who lives in Jacksonville now he hired baalke. Hahahahaha!!!!!!
Just make sure it's not a team doctor.
I didn't say they were leading the division, but the division is definitely leading the league.
Dude looks like a skull kid from the Legend of Zelda, right before the final transformation.
When you have his kind of fuck you money, you’re beyond a point of people caring about what you look like
I think I referenced this in my comment no?
I mean it probably sucks if you forgot a jacket
Am I remembering wrong or didn't they buy the Sabres first?
Wait... I thought we didn't actually own the team. Which is it?
I think it’s a reference to Packers fans being shareholders.
What 'bad ways' did George Lucas take?
It’s a boring ass answerr
>in poverty before inventing the NY Giants  Yes, quite literally.  "\[Tim\] Mara, the son of Elizabeth (née Harris) and John Mara, a policeman, of Irish descent, **was born into poverty** on New York City's Lower East Side. At the age of 13, he quit school in order to find work to support his mother. His first job was as an usher in a theater.\[2\] He then worked as a newsboy selling newspapers on the streets. This job brought him into contact with many of New York's bookmakers (or bookies). He soon became a runner for the bookies, earning five percent of the bets he collected and receiving tips from winners when he delivered their cash. By age 18, he was an established bookmaker himself."  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim\_Mara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Mara)
Interesting that you tie success exclusively to how much wealth you accumulate. If you owned an oil company or did other unethical things to acquire that money, should you still be considered “successful”?
I mean nothing, but does winning the lottery make you any less deserving than anyone else?
Does AB count?
I'm sure there were, a lot of NFL players are trash people, but are not high profile enough for the news to care. A better saying would be "1 high profile rapist "
as long as that tiny hand doesn't slip anywhere it's not supposed to i think that's fine.
Bezos is the sort of owner you wouldn't want in the NFL but if he were to buy the Mariners I'd throw a parade, fuck John Stanton and his cheap penny pinching bitch ass
>no point in cutting bobby last year  Money/salary cap. Can't afford to be sentimental when you're short on cap space, that's just how the league works.
Edited.  Btw their kicker from the 72 Super Bowl played on my soccer clubs Over 65 team.  He would play with a lit cigarette cupped in his hand and if nobody stopped him, a beer bottle in the other hand.  Bobby Howfield.
Megatron
Browns don’t have cheerleaders, one less thing to worry about.   We have a dog and a possum.
Bro what. Not being a reporter doesn’t mean you should just spread misinformation. Nothing I’m saying has anything to do with this situation but that just as a general rule is dumb as hell
I want there, I have no idea so can't really say definitely
Presented to team captain who skates around and hands it off to teammates. They all get there lap in before the suits touch it
I'd be okay with Mike Brown winning one just because of how much it would mean to him. Would be so emotional
yes siblings tend to have the same grandparents
Okay but this particular guy is salty about Lamar Jackson’s contract. You have to give browns fans a bit of leeway for enjoying an ownership group fucking over the *Ravens*.
They should join Watson in jail. Beyond being morally bankrupt, the Haslams are amongst the worst meddling ownership groups in the NFL. We'll be better off when they're six feet under
Meh maybe. He was never charged. And none of the 17 employees that were implicated accused him of being involved.  Be real, you hate him for the impact on Lamar Jackson’s contract.
Yeah…there’s no excusing him in SF. He’s done a nice job so far but if he does the same thing again here I wouldn’t be shocked. Credit where it’s due but I won’t be riding his D anytime soon
Funny enough the eagles owner is a pretty nice guy.
You’re right I misread that, my b
Im agreeing with you and providing additional context. Although i also wanted to add a little bit of emphasis to them not being good people

It's true. Why do I see so many eagles flairs bootlicking in this sub?
Critiques of power are extremely interesting
Shh, you’re not allowed to be successful and make money in life or else you’re literally a mass murderer
Huh that’s kinda neat. As far as billionaires go that’s significantly more palatable than most  But also you’re still basically saying “100 years ago a  career bookie made friends with a well known boxing promoter, who recommended him for ownership of an NFL team, which the bookie bought for the modern equivalent of a cheap used car. This is why his billionaire grand children deserve success” which is very silly
Did the current owners do anything?
Yes
Owning an oil company isn't unethical???   Sure, a lot of oil companies have done acts that are unethical, but - in 2023 - oil is still a necessary global commodity.   And for a long time before today it was even more necessary.
Whats going on with your flair, friend?
Mr. Bogus Charges
Yikes. What did the owner do with a dog and a possum?
Talking about how Snyder trafficked the Washington cheerleaders
Colby nooo!!!!
That thing's a opossum!? Why did they put it in an elf outfit?
The cutest doggy too! (I do love mastiffs though especially the wrinkly ones). That’s about it in terms of getting things right though.
Sorry if it looked that way but its not a criticism of you. Your comment was fine and I wanted to add emphasis.                But i wanted to claridy that its not misinformation. He took cheerleaders passports while doing a promo event and wouldnt give them back until they stripped etc. I wanted to be clear for people who dont know that he did that. He wasnt and wont be charged for it but he did that. And very likely worse. International incidents are hard to prove in courts and billionaires are hard to prosecute. But its pretty easy to tell what happened here and dan snyder is a disgusting human.
Most sports have the captain lift it, it's only here that the owner getting it first is a thing.
oh so the actual people who won it? that seems reasonable
Source?
Prove it
Yeah no gonna go ahead and say nobody has to give any browns fan leeway for anything. Fuck the Haslems.
Well worded.
I will never not get Jeffrey Lurie confused with Jeffrey Loria, the shitty former owner of the Miami Marlins.
But wait, if that’s true that means *I’m* the idiot here…
Bootlicking? Bruh. I just don’t like lame ass answers.
nah
>This is why his billionaire grand children deserve success  Why not? It's not like they're just sitting and collecting checks. Wellington Mara is in the top 3 most influential owners in NFL history and John still runs a lot of the team's day to day. When I say the Mara's are the Giants I'm not kidding, that family lives to run the team.
Here’s a tip. If your gonna try and argue about what happened in someone’s life maybe you should know first 👍
The three main owners of the team, Tim Mara, his son Wellington (The Duke), and his son John have only run the team. I think John Mara is also a big donor for some New York area hospitals.  Steve Tisch is the other 50% stakeholder in the franchise but idk what the fuck he does besides banging hookers in LA.
Oil companies lied about oil causing climate change despite knowing it did to avoid losing money.   https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/exxon-knew-about-climate-change-almost-40-years-ago/  Is getting rich that way ethical?
Jets fan who goes to Pitt. rooting for Kenny
In the words of Jimmy Carr, “Well my dog has never seen me have sex cause he’s always facing the other way.”
I know, my point is one less thing we have to worry about.
That thing is supposed to be a “Brownie” (a type of elf apparently).   The opossum just wonders around the stadium at random times when we need a come back win.   Sort of like Baker but more effective.
i made it up >:)
Unlike the response before lol. “Stole… from fraud” - Mr. Goldilocks  Thank you.
I'm sure daddy Elon appreciates you defending him.
How did losing three championships feel bud, was that interesting enough for ya?
I’m so sorry I didn’t know the childhood history of the current owners grandfather who died over 60 years ago.  I knew the giants were an old team and that John Mara inherited them. I knew that the current owner didn’t scrape by and magically happen upon an NFL team. The fact that someone in the chain of ownership had to actually work hard *over a century ago* doesn’t mean anyone involved today “deserves” anything.
Tisch is a film producer
oh, dope. Welcome to the party!  &#x200B;  Is Addison worth it at 17? Any chance he makes it to 32?
Jimmy Carr quotes always deserve upvotes.
I can hear this in his voice and then his laugh. :)
I apologize for forgetting the word via
Lmaoo, christ you guys are weird
I just like the eagles, swing and a miss pal
Well if you don’t know then why’d you try and act like you did?
I mean I'm obviously biased, but he was the best college wr in the country when he was playing with Kenny, so naturally I would love if they reunited. I've seen people say 17 is a reach but frankly I think he'd be worth it, especially considering he already has chemistry with the qb. no way he falls to 32 unless the teams know something we don't
Why draft a wr in the first when you can find studs in rounds 2-6?
I can hear so many quotes from their version of Countdown.  Shame I never watched it until after Sean Lock passed.  Wish America could do a good panel show, but seeing how badly The Fix on Netflix was done and the horrific American Task Master, I’ll just keep watching the ones from across the pond.
It’s aight I don’t expect well reasoned responses to a browns flair commenting on this subreddit.
Reddit really hates rich people for some reason
I commented on the *current* owners not somebody born in the 1800s.   And I was right. Nobody who currently owns the giants has ever even sniffed upper middle class, let alone poverty.
Cool. Let's start a rumor, then. Need him to drop.
The shittiest part is we had great panel shows for the first 40 years of TV being a thing. It wasn't til the 80's when they started doing celebrity assisted game shows instead of panel shows that it really died out. Stuff like Celebriity Pyramid. Hollywood squares was the only one of those that was a real panel show. it held out for a long time, but after that it was pretty much over. Unless you count whose line.
Some reason lol
You literally fucking said “oh the poor Maras who scraped by in poverty before inventing the NY giants.” It’s common knowledge the giants have been passed down through generations so the only person you could be talking about is the first Mara. He turned out to be poor. How have you not only gotten the history of the Maras wrong but even your own comment 💀💀💀
someone get him a bong and a camera asap
Damn Kyler can’t beat the homework allegations
lol i have seriously never seen a team throw their own quarterback under the bus more than the cardinals.
[ProFootballTalk] Kyler Murray: Steve Keim works, but his attention to being sober while driving can improve.
Oh sweet, are we doing "rag on Kyler" again this summer? Awesome.
 Homework man bad
Kyler's agent who fleeced the owner into giving the entire Cardinals braintrust from QB, HC to GM contract extension before the 2022 season, deserves a lot of credit.   He got them all paid big-time.
Second verse, same as the first.
The Cardinals might be sliding into the #1 spot in the poverty franchise rankings
Babe wake up, the new kyler doesn't study thread just dropped.
Keim followed with: "Kyler, I love you, but you are not a serious person."
Signing a QB is like marriage if you're not 100000% sure  DO.  NOT.  DO.  IT.
Double xp weekends confirmed
I hope Steve Keim appreciates that Kyler is the reason the rest of his stupid fucking contract is gonna get paid out. Because he's the only reason Keim got a stupid contract extension.  What fucking petty ass bullshit to throw Kyler under the bus now that you don't work there.
Ok kyler poor Study habits and leadership have been mentioned by multiple people now. At some point people have to start believing there is some truth to these claims.
Didn't they end up removing the part of his contract regarding him having to watch film? Can't say the man broke the terms of the contract lol  &#x200B;  TBF - Keim drafted him #1 and gave him that monster extension, so I think he's within his right to say whatever he feels. Tens of millions of dollars per year seems like a fair trade for a little bit of criticism, especially since it kinda seems valid
Steve Keim must have god-like attention to detail to work an NFL GM job with his severe alcoholism and multiple DUIs lol. Kyler's a low-key guy and must hate having all his former teammates or coaches/front office talking shit about him to the media
We are at the Kyler Murray Film Study Discussion point in the off-season timeline.
He must be extremely shit at studying for the FO to say stuff like this.
Should've kept the clause in his contract then
>Be Steve Keim  >Be the worst GM in the league  >Give my QB an albatross of a contract but include a film study clause  >Piss him off in doing so  >He gets injured, exposing all of my terrible drafting and FA philosophies in doing so  >Gets fired  >SurprisedPikachuFace.jpg over my QB being immature and lazy
Coachspeak for "the guy is an absolute fucking moron."
Maybe he has ADD Steve!!!!  Ever think if that Steeeeeeeeeve?
Kyler truthers out in force
Steve Keim works, but his drafting and self-control to not drink and drive could improve.
Solution to that is simple, take away the Steam deck when he's in the film room.
Yeah that was made pretty obvious with the whole contract clause fiasco
Oh god not the homework again
If only CoD didn’t release during a season
Not this again 🙄  I have seen teams stick with terrible QBs for *way* too long in hopes that they’d suddenly become competent. The Cardinals are different. They finally got a solid QB and are dead set on alienating him or wasting his potential by saddling him with a crap team, whichever comes first. I do not understand.
oh no
I blame Madden. If they made the defenses more lifelike, Murray wouldn't need to study tape
not a good look for Kyler
Wasn't this obvious? A fair number of people (good evaluators with NFL exp) pointed out as much when reviewed Kyler's games.  Hopefully he'll improve.
Let the COD jokes pour in
Grass is green, the sky is blue people
Why did they sign him to that huge extension if they hate him so much?
Every time I hear some news about Kyler it’s the cards shitting on him. I’m sure there’s a local comic out there that’s drawn that.
How I describe my adhd in a nutshell.
They paid this guy more than Mahomes. Cardinals imo are the worst franchise in the NFL right now.
“Kyler Murray is lazy.”  “Actually, he’s not lazy he’s just not very bright.”   Jeez, with  support like this how can he fail?
I guess there weren't enough QB news topics in circulation.
Keim is such a loser. Murray is literally the only good player he's drafted in like 5 years now. Too bad they removed his incompetent ass from the GM role
Is he talking about football or COD?
Why is this drunk ass clown talking about us still, we already suck and it’s mostly his fuckin fault.
It's like someone took an air pump and inflated steve keim
*Feed it directly into my veins*
why are you going on a podcast talking about a guy you had a working relationship with for almost five years the moment you “leave” the job
They want a redo on his tiny ass so bad
I see he’s still drinking
If it is true, i wouldn't mind his teammates calling him out either. Like they give their 100% every year while highest paid player of their don't give a fuck. I'd be pissed.  People are going to shit on Keim because he's exposing it but the fact still remain Kyler Murray is a big mo*****ng red flag.   Keim should just trade him at this point instead of killing his value. Not smart.
something something something COD and homework clause
Steve Drives a car but his decision making in regards to driving after drinking could improve. I will not stand any slander from someone with all that money who still won’t call A cab and someone who set us back from the roster he left us.
The cards suck. I'm allowed to say that cause my wife is a cards fan
Keim is such a fucking joke. Jesus christ
I think dude has ADHD, surprised he hasn't been diagnosed by now.
Homework clause was put there for a reason
If they’re throwing him under the bus this hard then it’s for reason.  He’s probably really as awful as we meme him to be.  It’s probably comical but what’s the dead money if you cut him next season lmao and draft Caleb or drake
Uh oh warzone 2 ranked is about to drop too
Fuck Keim
This is such a great meme. Man just loves call of duty. Let him live
I'm curious as to what Kyler thinks of us memeing him about his height
Time is a flat circle
Any shot of a wild draft night AZ QB shuffle? Cards stay at 3, take Richardson, and then promptly announce they’ve dealt Kyler… unlikely but would be such good theater.
Kyler should announce that he’s playing baseball.
And Steve Keim is a drunk idiot that burned that franchise to the ground practically
Kyler Murray is Michael Vick 2.0, change my mind
This is the same guy who couldn't remember Hopkins age, the fact the cards wore a black helmet last year as well as messed up a lot of other really easy facts in the interview that he should have known being the GM. Something tells me that Steve Keim is not a reliable source for people not paying attention to detail.
dude shut your mouth man. Like okay behind closed doors. Why air out your QB to the media 😂.
Also… he’s a bit short.
I feel like it's in poor taste to criticize an athlete while they're injured, off-season or not. Criticize him when he's playing and not performing up to standard lol  "LOLOL KYLER MURRAY IS USELESS" *kicks out his crutches from under him*  That's what this looks like lol
So happy to have Jalen Hurts as an eagles fan, he feels like the polar opposite on the spectrum to Murray. I just imagine Jalen studying 24/7 goes through every little minute detail to better himself and people around him. A class act.
Cards stinky
Call of duty Modern Warfare
I would be surprised if Steve Keim knew the basics of football.
I almost forgot that Kyler Murray was apparently the laziest little person in football.
Man they have a prime opportunity to try and fleece the raiders or colts for their pick and send them kyler. If they’re so out on him and don’t like his antics, why not go get a QB and blue chip defender in this draft?
Kyler has to demand a trade. Toxic work environment
You know what makes people work harder and learn to improve mistakes...publicly shaming them and insulting them  How in the fuck was this man ever allowed to draft another QB for that franchise
That sounds brutal coming from the gm lol
Cannot believe this guy is still a GM
Is Steve Keim their hc?
Same fam.
Cardinals fans....are the reports of Murray's film study issues overstated?
Who hates who more? The Colts with Carson Wentz or the Cardinals with Kyler Murray?
He can't work on his height deficiency
Master motivator Steve Keim
Oh shit! We’re doing this again?
I think I missed this episode of Webster.
Here we go....
Caleb Williams YOU are an Arizona Cardinal
So it sucks ass, lmao
Hey, I thought we were done doing us. Can another team please step up and do some dumb shit?
TLDR. He does extensive film sessions.. Would be better if he wasn't playing video games at the same time.
We gonna do this again?
Context really helps here. Twitter, and this sub pretty much only allowing tweets makes everything a TMZ story.
Maybe the guy should, idk, put in some film work then?  Or all these leaks and reports are just consistently 🙄
Sounds like my old school reports
Small Jamarcus
Great leaders place blame on themselves when discussing things externally and handle stuff like this internally.  Steve Keim does the total opposite.
Why do I feel like he is likely concussed and they are just saying he does not study…
If he put as much effort as he does in cod then he'd have a ring
How badly run are the Browns when you consider that the Cardinals actually made it to a Super Bowl this century?
It would if it was a video game
Shitting on Murray seems to be a key part of focusing on his health.
So play less games and study ? Umm bet he taught he was done with school/college
Why would you say this lol
This report is hinting at the possibility, that the Cardinals might draft one of these top QB prospects... guess we wait and see
So it's not so much that he has a crappy work ethic and instead thier issue with him was that he wasn't detail oriented enough. Coukd just be an age thing that'll he will grow out of. Generally people see the importance of paying attention to details more and more as they get older.
Isn’t Steve keim a drunk driving piece of shit?
I mean he could start working harder.
Franchises leaking "homework" issues to the press are the worst.  It's always has been and always will be bullshit.
It feels like they’re not even throwing him at this point but literally swerving to hit him. And then backing up over him.
Reading between the lines it sounds like the Cardinals talked to Kyler about putting in more film work, but he just didn't do it.   Now it feels they're airing it to the media in hopes it motivates Kyler.  Kyler's own current/former teammates have criticized his lack of leadership. Imagine being a Cardinals player and knowing Kyler slacks off but still got that insane contract (that will prevent the rest of the team from getting $ due to the cap).   Everyone in the Cardinals org just seems low key irritated with Kyler's attitude and lack of effort.
At this point multiple named and unnamed current and former Cardinals have said something to the same effect. That and homework clause should already let you know it's likely true.
Maybe so but in this particular case Keim is no longer affiliated with the team so he can say whatever.
I suspect that anything they're saying publicly was already said in private, and ignored.
He doesn’t work for the cardinals
But Keim isn't with the team anymore...
If I had a nickel for everything a highly drafted, Heisman winning QB from Oklahoma got thrown under the bus by their team because of "maturity issues" I would have two nickels
Not the same but as a Raider fan, I've never seen a coach show as much indifference to Carr as Joshy boy did.
They’re just mad they fucked up. Giving Murray all that money was horrible. Now they’re fucked and they know it.
To be fair, Keim's not part of the org anymore.
It really makes you wonder how bad it is
It's reminds me of the gifted kid in high school that always got shit because everyone thought he wasn't putting in enough effort.  But honestly watching Kyler as a Cards fan was sometimes infuriating.  Misses open read, misses his chance to dump off to the RB, scrambles, throws 20 yard dime to Hopkins... Fans all cheer.  Next play: Misses open read, misses his chance to dump off to the RB, scrambles, gets sacked... Fans all want the coaches fired.  I will say this till he proves otherwise, Kyler is the most talented Mid QB to ever exist.  He's got an arm, he's got accuracy, he's got athleticism.  But he trusts his eyes more than he trusts his mind knowing how and when people will be open.  The idea that comes from studying is why everyone rags on him.
The guy who said this is not a Cardinals employee.
When you’re so small you can fit under the bus, there’s no harm in doing so.
It’s like they *want* him to fail at this point.
*glances at the Jets*  Eh....
The browns called mayfield a non-adult before they could trade him
Some Cardinals fans are still arguing the study clause is not an indication of his work habits. They’re going to have to move the goalposts again after this tweet.
Well they’re stuck with him so might as well treat him like shit. Lol
I just don’t get what the end game is? Do they think he will change with public shaming? Lol
Honestly man it’s fucking crazy
Do we start asking the QB at 3 question? But then why the fuck did they pay him?
I'd be so frustrated if I were Kyler. Org is fueling a bunch of bullshit, but if he couldve been healthy and effective next season, he could've gotten the Lamar treatment!
Have you met the Raiders subreddit this past year?
*Dak Prescott has entered the chat*
Raiders with Russel comes to mind. Dipshit player given a fortune, qctijg like a dipshit.
The same team that charges players to use the training facilities in the offseason, no less.
It's not hard when the QB can walk under the bus without even bending.
This, plus their complete annihilation of “Terry” this week… fuck, the Cards are just blasting away at everybody.  I kinda like it, honestly.
the bus couldnt even run him over as he is a short king.
It's not like this is the first time they've tried to send a message that his film study isn't where they'd like it to be.
I feel like they knew he was a purgatory QB, but had no better options and didn't want him to go to another team and have success so they gave him a bag, but are upset about that decision so make it known as often as they can...
To be fair, I've never heard of such a talent wasting his talent at that position to this extent.
You'd think they would have traded Rosen away before drafting his replacement, instead of tanking his value first.
He plays that much Xbox
Im willing to bet theres some fire under all this smoke
I thought the Seahawks did that with Russel Wilson, but last season proved me wrong.
You'd think they would be more appreciative after drafting the Chosen Rosen and seeing him crash and burn.
Whenever I see stuff like this I just imagine Kyler at his house, like getting a bowl of cereal and then he looks down to check Twitter and it’s just his boss publicly shitting on him for no reason
How quick to forget Baker Mayfield
The GM has done this with multiple QBs
Whats worse is when they land the 1.01 next year and try to move Murray people will just put these comments in the trade discussions to lower the price.
I don’t think they’re throwing him under the bus. I’m in Arizona, been a cards fan most of my life. Murray hasn’t done much to endear himself here. I’m not talking about performance which he visibly regressed this past season.   But how he actually handles himself to the team. He raised quite a few eyebrows when he made comments about studying film or his lack of and defended it. Or how he visibly shows lack of professionalism on the sidelines and towards his head coach.  Dude is a phenomenal talent but has waaaaaays to go to putting it all together. As of right now he can only read one side of the field in terms of breaking down defenses and that’s being generous.   He improvises way too much. After the 10-2 start last season and his new contract he thought he arrived and didn’t need to put more work in.  Hopefully the injury, the trash season he played, and playing a part of getting his HC and GM fired gets him to wake up and do the work necessary on the field and with his relationships to become the quarterback we believe he can be.  Otherwise…. Who knows we could talking about Caleb Williams down here in PHX.
I am sure Keim would have a comment for Kyler's drives as well
[ProFootballTalk] Steve Keim: Well, Kyler Murray works, but his attention to his K/D in Call of Duty can improve.
Sober while drafting would have been nice too.
> Kyler Murray: Steve Keim works, but his attention to being sober while driving can improve.  Kyler Murray: Also, he needs to work on being a better teammate and not pretend to be another employee after getting pulled over
They throw him under the bus every chance they get
I thought you'd be there holding daisies. She always waits for me.
Boom roasted.
*insert Kyler Murray CoD joke*... Ok I gotta do it now.  If Kyler wasn't busy playing double XP weekend, he would be very upset!
Shit is a Game of Thrones Summer at this point lol, its been like 2 and a half straight years of it
Rag on kyler, rosgers is a bitch, lamar can’t throw. 49ers in on everything, peak off season.
I genuinely have no idea why I root for this team anymore, even our most beloved player of all time doesn't want anything to do with this trash heap
As always.  I swear fans of other NFC West teams are the only guys that respect the dude.  Legit looked great in 2021, just Kliff gets figured out in the playoffs.
I mean what he did was stupid and deserves criticism
Call of Duty man no bueno
I mean he’s been good. Not all pro good, but more than good enough to win consistently. Frankly of all the issues the cardinals have had and current have, he’s on the lesser end
This shows way more ineptitude by the keim than kyler. I dont know if its true or not but weve seen kyler play well and know about qbs who havent watched enough film that did well. Weve only seen keim fuck up and this looks unprofessional and weird.
Maybe Lamar should hire him.
My name is Kevin   That is my name   They call me Kevin   Cause that’s my name
I’m Henry the VIII I am  Henry the VIII I am I am  I got married to the widow next door  She’s been married seven times before  And every man was an Henry  She wouldn’t have a Willie or a Sam  I’m her 8th old man I’m Henry   Henry the 8th I am I am   Henry the 8th I am
Kyler is a punk… Kyler is a runt
My name is Ian Duncan and I'm here to say  Im going to rap to the beat in a rapping way  I got a real big penis and I drink lots of tea
Who the hell would be #1 if not us?
The oldest team in the NFL, and one of the worst winning percentages out of all of them (.424).  Only Houston, Jacksonville, and Tampa are worse. And 2 of those are teams that were created after I was born, so I don't really like counting their shittiness on the same level as the shittiness the Cardinals have provided.
Might be? They already are.
Back*
First the yotes, now the cards. At least the suns are good?
begging [thru text]
So fucking spicy, and so fucking  true.
idk, QBs like Kyler are good enough where a team has to pick the lesser of the two evils; let him walk and hope for something better or sign him and work with him. Regardless of the decision, you've gotta own it afterwards.  Keim drafted and is now currently throwing Murray under the bus like, "bro this guy sucks at film study lol" is an all-time bitch move. Like dude, you drafted the fucking guy. If anything this makes Keim look even worse.
Unexpected runescape
Fr. This whole quote pisses me off. He was a terrible GM who was carried off a couple people.
Right?  Whether or not Kyler is a hard worker, dude, shut the fuck up.  What are you doing airing your franchise's dirty laundry to the public? Are you stupid or just drunk?  This is some basic shit, man.
Kyler blamed the media on this last year as if he himself didn't admit he doesn't watch tape like the top QBs do which he did admit.
He's been a pretty bad GM though.Scot McCloughan though is a high functioning alcoholic GM.
I bet Kyler hates it mostly because it’s true
> Kyler's a low-key guy and must hate having all his former teammates or coaches/front office talking shit about him to the media  Wouldn't a low-key guy not really care about that?
Has he had more than 1 DUI?
To my knowledge, toddlers can’t be diagnosed with ADHD.  Their brains are too early in the development stage to determine if it’s that or just, ya know, being overwhelmed by big new things
It's honestly kind of impressive how the Cardinals are able to completely fuck up every possible team they field
Not surprising for a team that makes their players pay for their own meals.
I mean *gestures broadly at the Bidwells*  Believe me, we all want Kyler to be good and he defintely can be, but this poverty franchise can't get a decent culture going let alone a winning team.
How about it’s not a good look that this idiot drafted him and then fucked up the team
Keim has been a surprisingly mediocre drafter these last five years. Christian Kirk, Jalen Thompson, Byron Murphy, Zach Allen turned into good players. Isaiah Simmons and Zaven Collins have a good chance to become elite if Jonathan Gannon is as good with linebackers as he's billed to be. It's his first five drafts that should have gotten his ass canned a long time ago.
New Englanders love cod!
I'm not sure if Kyler has any value to any other teams.  I think any trade involving Kyler would be a Brock Osweiller situation.
Oh it’s pretty clear he’s a severe alcoholic
I doubt he'll play that clutch when he gets to the playoffs
I don’t think he works for the team anymore, needs to find some way to be relevant.
Keim doesn't even work there. ToXiC EnViRoNmEnT
Being lazy isn't a mistake.
I don't know.  I remember when the Raiders gave JaMarcus Russell a blank DVD and asked him if he watched it.
Why is it bullshit? If anything it makes them seem like shitty interviewers for not figuring this issue out predraft. And shitty orgs for not being able to fix it. As bad as it reflects on Kyler it's much worse for the billion dollar franchise that can't get a tutor for him. To me it's them self reporting.
If my QB isn't studying and working 168 hours a week, he's basically hitler, especially if his contract is coming up.
Yeah honestly, the contract having film hours was throwing him under the bus. Everything else after is exactly what you described.
What are they supposed to do? Just be totally fine with a QB who doesn't have any attention to detail?
It doesn’t help that he’s dancing in the road drunk at night on a forest road and jumping out like a baby deer in front of cars
Richie Aprile style....
While drunk?  I think we know the man for the job...
An old manager of mine used this turn of phrase with our department over something relatively trivial. He said, “if you guys aren’t doing this, I’m not only going to throw you under the bus, I’ll be the one driving over you for it too.”   Fuck you, Jeff, you brown-nosing bald prick
https://youtu.be/d3XwQcfZQtw
Maybe they’re just parking and didn’t see the little dude?
That’s the most annoying thing. Kyler could be a top ten, maybe even top five QB but he’s the one standing in his own way.   Burrow didn’t have a cellphone for a significant amount of time the season he won the title at LSU. If Kyler is anyway close to that, we are successful
I'm just not sure why they extended him in the first place. With the whole "study clause" they threw in, you could tell they were obviously worried about his off-the-field work. Did they really think that throwing money at the problem would fix it?
Keim is out now right? Just seems to me he's airing it all out. Not really a targeted push from the Cardinals organization
Its becoming commonplace for Arizona sports orgs to draft really talented players who put in very little effort. DeAndre Ayton and Murray are prime examples of this
Was the contract clause not already “airing it to the media”? It’s not like they had any reason to believe the contract would remain confidential. This just feels like piling on. Also given Kiem has been fired and is under fire for scandals, it’s not surprising he’d try to divert attention away from himself.  This isn’t an organizational move, if it is, it’s the dumbest they could possibly make. It lowers Kylers trade value and pisses him off, lose/lose for Arizona
> Imagine being a Cardinals player and knowing Kyler slacks off but still got that insane contract (that will prevent the rest of the team from getting $ due to the cap).   I mean…if the player is good enough he’s going to get his $$ regardless. Whether it be from his current team or another.
Where there’s smoke, there’s fire. I also think it’s true. The clause is a big red flag. 4 hours of film study each week during the season should be no biggie for an NFL QB. He shouldn’t be forced to do it.
Yea, the Cardinals are a badly run organization, but even a badly run organization doesnt add a homework clause to a QB contract unless they really think its necessary.  It was obviously going to leak. Its obviously embarrassing.  You dont do that unless you really feel like you have to or you desperately want to send a message.  Mind you, Im not on the anti-Kyler train. I think there is more to this whole narrative than people think, but I also dont believe Kyler is just being thrown under the bus for no reason at all.
The number of people missing that in this thread is staggering.
The trick is finish 2nd in voting
It's not a lot, but it's weird that it happened twice
* Denver Broncos have entered the chat
I still don't understand why they gave him that contract. They would have been so much better off trading him and starting over.  Actually with the #3 pick they could take a QB now and trade Murray next year.
He can both have an average work ethic and be a good quarterback who’s worth that contract, they aren’t exclusive. Yeah it’d be great if he was Brady-esque and lived and breathed film, but he can be a good QB regardless.   Only time will tell when he’s back from his ACL.
Couldn't they have used the homework clause to give themselves an out?   "Oh, Kyler has repeatedly blown off the required film study, he's in breach of contract, all his guaranteed money is now void." Then he could be cut or traded without penalty, right?
>It's reminds me of the gifted kid in high school that always got shit because everyone thought he wasn't putting in enough effort.  Kyler is that kid, now in a college full of those kids, and those kids are all trying harder
And then signed a serial sexual assaulter! So Arizona has that over the Browns at this point
Keim doesn’t work for AZ anymore
Keim: Kyler Murray drives well, but his downswing and follow through can improve.
Cardinals put that clause in his contract because they were 100% confident his K/D was where it needed to be
To be fair, the coach wanted him.
You forgot the short joke
Idk I'd take honor in the fact a wife beater doesn't want anything to do with me
Kurt Warner?
No doubt it was dumb. The smartest thing he ever did was take the bullets out of the gun
What did he do?
Some might say shorter end..
I really don’t understand why they got this electric QB and then said fuck it we’re putting all our draft capital into linebacker
They need to be a better “TEAM”, instead of just waiting on 1 player to be the end all be all
> Not all pro good, but more than good enough to win consistently.  In October, sure.
they should’ve traded him now they are stuck with this contract and QB who won’t probably ever lead them to a super bowl because he doesn’t care enlugh
We hate Keim and this is why. What a shitbag and I'm glad he's gone
They call me the Hip-Hop-Apotamus,  My lyrics are bottomless!  ...  ...
second verse same as the first!
Browns
Commies.
Y’all had some success recently, probably this season definitely but you still had hope not too long ago. Which is not something every team could claim
Fail Blazers and Falcons
Texans
Keim is also fired and has to blame someone for being fired.
It’s way cooler that you thought RuneScape first instead of COD anyways
Pretty sure it’s a CoD joke
Is he this ignorant or is he actually trying to not get hired any time soon?
Considering he has multiple extreme DUI's on his record i would say he is both stupid and drunk
I think he said it best himself - you don’t get to where he is now being lazy. He hates it because he’s worked his ass off to get discredited by some drunk.
As long as they aren't saying it over Xbox Live he probably doesn't even know they're saying it   AAAAYYYYEEEEE
Apparently he had one in 1996 as well. I had no idea either.
Bro snuck Simmons and Collins in there and thought we wouldn’t notice
Seriously dude he got fined like $200k instead of just catching a cab. Not to mention putting others in danger cuz that man was hammered
I forgot AZ cleaned house lol. Whoops
You are attributing laziness to something that you have no idea is laziness or not. Its hard to know what you dont know.  So he might feel hes studying properly, or studying enough for himself to succeed...but its not  Its why young QBs need veterans in the QB room
The clause said he only had to study 4 hours a week. FAR from excessive.
But what if the team was between a rock and a hard place with a potential franchise QB that actually had poor study habits and attention to detail?    You gotta pay him, but you can also expect him to work to realize his potential.
I don't think that is throwing him under the bus. Dude isnt putting in the work like he needs to.   Kyler is the cause of the problem, not the Cardinals
The contract wouldn't be throwing him under the bus, just asking him to work
Makes you think, how bad is this guy’s study habits that this is needed?
For starters not give him a $230 million dollar extension...
If you need to write a line in his contract about studying, cause a storm, retract it, fire the head coach, then months later bring the film thing up again you should probably not sign him in the first place
They didn’t have to resign a quarterback who they don’t believe studies enough film or has attention to detail. Either roll with him as he is or get off the bus but don’t resign him and just keep throwing shade from on high. Terrible look for any other players watching how this plays out.
I agree, but what do you expect? You give a guy generational wealth, and it's human nature to relax. If Kyler is terrible and the Cardinals go 0-17, he still gets his money. The incentive to work hard and win just isn't there.  He knows that they can't do anything to him, and they know it.
Trade him
I mean they don't have to publicly call him out for it on multiple occasions lol
Wait…..   Whhhat???
damn i didn’t know that about burrow, that’s actually sick. i was involuntarily phoneless for like 5 days last week and its kinda crazy how productive you can be without one
that's what happens when you're a poverty franchise.  Kyler was by far the most talented QB that team had drafted in its 30 whatever years in Arizona. There was immense public pressure (and frankly probably internal pressure) after finally getting the top pick, and spending it on a talented QB that was actually producing. They were never letting him go; the team, the owner, the fans were way too desperate to finally have a guy.  And if they'd waited to extend him, his contract would loom even larger now than it did when he signed it.  I know people say his contract was dumb, but if they were always planning to retain him, it was actually smart to do it sooner than later.  Imagine if they hadn't done it and he worked on his professionalism and the team had gone to the playoffs for the second year in a row. Everyone would've been calling Arizona idiots for not extending him earlier
Both were the number 1 overall pick of their respective drafts as well.
Suns kind of treated Ayton like shit though.
Making them *pay you* for putting in effort probably isn't helping.
They didn’t really want to even give Ayton the contract they gave him anyway
> Was the contract clause not already “airing it to the media”? It’s not like they had any reason to believe the contract would remain confidential.    I’m not sure about that. I’m sure they knew the contract would leak but the nitty gritty details of contracts usually aren’t reported on or given much thought. I wouldn’t be surprised if they thought it would mostly fly under the radar. Obviously they were wrong but I doubt they expected it to blow up like it did.
The top QBs do that every day
The clause was only for 4 hours a week?!?!?  How was he playing QB in the NFL before that and watching less than 4 hours of film a week? I feel like I probably spend over 4 hours a week watching football plays of some sort lol
Right? I had to scroll down way too far to find this comment
They got rid of Rosen pretty fast and then it would have been Kyler really fast. Wouldn’t card fans have rioted if they traded Kyler?
I would argue that needing to require four hours a week of film study, and constant reports and complaints of it, implies a far less than average work ethic
It feels like a LOT of people in this thread don’t know this lol
He still was involved with that horrible contract which doesn’t make him look great if he looks for another job.
Isn't that pretty much the whole swing?
It's not like he took the wrong QB. You'd probably just not go QB with hindsight, but that's hard to do. Take Bosa/Burns, suck again with Rosen, draft Burrow/Herbert. That's the play, but you may get fired before you can draft your QB.
If Kyler could see the chalkboard over his desk, he’d be very upset!
I failed... I just commit seppuku.
I think they mean wife beater larry
He’da killed them, he’da shot keim and them both
He woulda shot Kim and them both
Heada shoot Kim and them both
Literally nothing on record
Their tiniest problem for sure
DAE KYLER SHORT
Justin Fields is dogshit
They got him the best WR in the NFL
there's no I in team!!!
Can Kyler pitch?
Right. Not only does Kyler not do enough film work, he’s also been injured the back half of the past 3 seasons. I don’t know why they didn’t just move on from him. He’s too small to play 17 games a season (much less the 20-21 games needed to win a SB). Plus, his skill-set is one where if he does get injured (which the pattern clearly shows he will) his effectiveness on the field gets shot to shit. He’s not playing through the ankle sprains Mahomes get and playing at a high level through that injury Like Mahomes does. He’s not playing an entire season with a torn MCL like Brady did in 2020, and going to still play at a high enough level to win SB MVP (Like Brady did that season).
Traded him for what? Who would they have put at QB after trading the guy they just picked number 1 overall? Should they have gone back and signed Josh Rosen?
> who won’t probably ever lead them to a super bowl    There are definitely legitimate criticisms about Kyler but saying this about a 25 year old QB who’s been pretty damn good when healthy is just crazy to me.
“Why does he get all the easy ones?!”
I mean, the Browns have a lot more chips in the ancient days. Also more hall of famers, playoff appearances, and year of contention. Apart from having a rapist quarterback, there’s not much that the Cardinals aren’t significantly worse at.
Browns were good at one point. That point may be the late 1940's, but still.   The Cardinals are a good 50 years older than the Browns and have literally nothing to show for it besides a championship back when all the players had a second job, and a fluke super bowl run off of the corpse of Kurt Warner and Larry Fitzgerald.
Browns at least have big names in you-know-who, Garrett, Chubb, etc. Cards have Murray and unfortunately it seems like Budda (we'd treat you really well BB!) is sticking around, but D-Hop is all but gone and idk how much Ertz, Conner, or even Prater have to give to a mediocre at best team
The Commies were legit good in like the 80's, way better than the Cardinals or Browns have ever been in the Super Bowl era
They have rings, the only team that's close to us is the Lions and I think we have the edge
>Y’all had some success recently  They've had one winning season in the last 15 years. One.
It’s not cooler though because it means he’s thinking RS3 and not OSRS. RuneScape died once it added shit like double xp
CoD I can't believe the kids these days.
He's probably not, he only got the gig from being good friends with Bidwell
It's not just Keim. Several of your current/former players criticized Kyler's lack of leadership too. Leadership isn't just about putting in the work, it's also about how you carry yourself.  >**“It was like they created a monster,”** an unnamed Cardinals veteran told Michael Silver. The unnamed player claimed **once Kyler got paid, he didn’t seem eager to do the things that are expected out of franchise QBs, including studying the game plan.**  >**"Grow up. Be a man and grow up,"** Beachum told Arizona Sports 98.7 FM on Wednesday.  >**"When you're in that position, we need you to lead more.** You're the face of the franchise ... you have to lead in every single capacity."  >"Kyler is his own individual, he's his own person, he beats to his own drum.. But, at the end of the day, you have to be able to lead an entire organization, you've got to lead a team."  >**"Kyler Murray don't care about nobody but Kyler Murray.** That's just the matter of the fact."  >"First of all, I don’t have any beef with Kyler Murray," Peterson said. "(People said) oh, ‘Patrick blatantly disrespected Kyler.’ I didn’t do that. What I meant by my comment was, **when you’re a franchise quarterback, you have to carry yourself a certain way. So if you’re having bad body language, pouting, moping on the sideline, what type of energy you think that feeds off to your teammates?** That’s what I meant about Kyler caring about himself, because **he’s not putting the team first."**  >"When you make a bad throw, you’re coming off to the sideline, you’re dropping your shoulders, how do you think the defense feels? **If our starting quarterback don’t have any energy, no fire that we can win this game, how can we?"**  >"Those mannerisms are alarming. **I’m just saying something that most people may be afraid to tell him. It’s no secret, everybody sees it.** You see it every time they’re on television. You see **Kyler Murray pouting, cursing at the head coach, calling out the offensive scheme."**
No one says he doesn't work hard either.
I still think the film study thing was smart and okay. Even saying it publicly. I want a qb that studies, not wings it. Kyler is not a top dog anymore as far as im concerned, he is madly talented and one of the best. But i feel he is only lowering his own ceiling.     Like watching film isnt hard. Why would you fight that.
> You gotta pay him, but you can also expect him to work to realize his potential.  But why? Why do you have to pay him?   Signing top 12-15 QBs to top 3 contracts is how teams end up in purgatory.   Kyler Murray hadn't won shit on his rookie deal. Why not move on?
Maybe don’t leak shit talking to your favorite reporters every other week. You don’t see Bengals beat writers or Chiefs beat writers going “Per anon person in organization, this QB fucking sucks dick. Here’s 12 reasons why. #8 will shock you!”
There's no excuse for giving homework to a grown man you're paying hundreds of millions of dollars to. If you genuinely can't expect him to take his job seriously, you don't pay him for it. And if you CAN expect him to do his job, you don't make him look like a child and yourself look like a buffoon by putting a. useless clause in the contract.
you dont gotta pay him more than Mahomes. That is just bad business and stupid.
Do that stuff privately or choose someone that doesn't have these issues.

Don’t sign up to a huge contract then? If you have that in the contract he isn’t your guy.   No other in QB in history would have that in their contract. You can see why it is disrespectful to Kyler.   Both can be the problem, are you telling you think the Cardinals have been well run?
I think the point is there's a way to hold him accountable without publicly humiliating him.
No other QB at his level has that in his contract, he has the right to feel disrespected.   If you don’t trust him enough, just don’t pay him that contract.   And if they didn’t think it was an idiotic move, why did they go back and remove it.
What are they supposed to do now? If your owner tells you to sign the contract you do it and then try to deal with the aftermath, that feels like what Keim is trying to do.
If Kyler can pull his shit together, it’s better than fishing for a QB in the draft.   I do expect them to trade Kyler in year three or so though.
How about they pay him $230M so they aren’t concerned about hurting his feelings when they want him to improve?
It reminds me so much of the Andrew Wiggins contract where the owner wanted to meet with him first and ask if he would get better lol.  https://sports.yahoo.com/timberwolves-just-want-andrew-wiggins-promise-hell-get-better-200047839.html
At this point it feels like they’re trying to intentionally piss him off enough that he’ll accept a trade to the first team that’ll take him.
This doesn’t make sense. This was written INTO the extension. They could’ve traded him befor paying. They are stupid
That's not how high level athletes generally work
You read the man!
According to the ESPN or whatever story, his phone broke in Oct and his parents got tired of having to call his roommate, coach, and the practice facility to get a hold of him so they legit flew down and bought him a working phone.   Burrow is some shit, man.
At the same time, Mahomes, Allen, Herbert, Rodgers, etc. have all certainly used phones in recent years and have still been elite. The phone thing feels like an needless exaggerated part of the Joe Burrow mythos
that is a cope and excuse. They paid a dude significantly worse than Mahomes with study problems, more than Mahomes. It's just a bad decision, always was, and was obvious from the beginning
1st overalls just don't work as good for us I guess lmao. Some of the best players both franchises have picked have been below 1st overall (think Booker or Fitz, though Fitz was 3rd overall which isn't half bad)
that's wrong actually. Ayton asked for a 5 year contract (I believe around 175 million or so), but since the Suns matched the offer the Pacers gave him, he had no choice but to sign since he was an RFA. So they actually preferred to give him the contract they did rather than the one he asked for
Yeah idk, I'd expect no less than double that per week.
Yes, 4 hours a week during the season.
He was athletically superior to his competition by leaps and bounds, now, not so much.
At the end of the day you have to care about winning more than listening to what fans want. As long as you win, fans will stick around.
Seeing fans defend this is baffling when a lot of us watch easily 4+ hours of NFL games a week during the season without a $230 million contract.
Yeah the undersized guy who won ROY, Heisman, and was a top 10 pick in 2 different sports has a bad work ethic.
Seemed to be obviously owner driven if they had to put in all this clauses to make it work. That was prolly the FO hedging there bet again at kyler because they weren’t 100% sold. But you keep asses in the seats the owner wanted it done.
Maybe he's really good at setting up to address the ball and it's just the swinging where things go awry, I mean the swingings about 99% of it but that first 1% he's gangbusters
Does it look like I play football?
shut up nerd
Just an absolutely *exquisite* backswing.
Backswing is 90% of the swing. The rest is just following the path you loaded yourself into.
god damn man can you imagine the Cards with Nick Bosa and Justin Herbert instead of Kyler and Isiah Simmons?
He got a booster seat now, he good.
That’s my life I’d like to welcome y’all to the cardinals shit show
Homie just has severe ADHD but his talent took him crazy far
Lol the biggest knock/controversy on Kyler Murray is that he needs to study film more and improve his leadership. He's talked about on social media like he's committed some sort of heinous offenses and has irredeemable character traits
They didn’t do that but DHop and Hollywood when healthy are certainly a top-10 duo
Yeah but idk Oline seems like it probably would’ve been a much better investment
for picks and try again. Cost sunk is what’s going to kill them going forward. No one could’ve predicted he would be this lazy. Maybe the signs were there pre draft when he considered baseball instead
I mean, the current Browns don't. Sure the old Browns do but that team (the Ravens) aren't in Cleveland anymore.
The  ~~redskins~~ ~~footballs~~ *commies* took sloppy seconds on the superbowl train that the NFC East ran on the Bills in the early 90's.  It was giants, ~~redskins~~ ~~footballs~~ *commies*, Cowboys, and then the Cowboys again, while the eagles watched and cried in the corner.
15 years ago was 2008 dipshit  Wouldn’t even be an accurate statement with a 5 year window 🤣
That's total horseshit. Say what you will about Keim's performance as GM, but he put the work in for over a decade with the organization and earned his way into that role.
Brought the receipts. Damn
God damn… you killed that man. He has a family…
A little concerning that you either:  A. Had all these quotes ready to go  Or   B. You spent the time to find all of these quotes to win an internet argument  Either way, hard to dispute all that lmao
> Several of your current/former players criticized Kyler's lack of leadership too  You listed one anonymous source, Kelvin Beachum who is a bum and should not be employed by any serious organization, and Patrick Peterson, who walked back what he said when confronted about it and refused to elaborate, and has been taking shots at the Cardinals organization since he left.
Ooooo a bunch of anonymous sources, and two salty ex cardinals (one of which ran back what he said but ig we will ignore that). Tons of other teammates have come out in support of K1. I don’t think our problems stem from QB - in fact that is maybe our biggest bright spot. We sucked because we had an alcoholic GM, who we are for some reason talking about, who constructed an awful roster for long term success.  Edit: I wanna add on to this, Keim probably doesn’t like Kyler because he came in and cleaned up the mess he made. Let’s not forget, Keim picked the biggest bust of the last 5 years in Josh Rosen.
Not that it matters he got 100m, he can just wash out now and be set for life.
Why does everyone in this sub think that if you don't have a top 5 quarterback you can just go get one? Odds are that you're not even going to find another top 15 guy
Yeah, look at Lamar. The Ravens are playing hardball with him and he's accomplished much more than Murray
I think in a vacuum, Kyler throws a better ball. But it'll take a renaissance to prove to me that Minshew wasn't the better rookie that year.
I feel like people undervalue contract inflation.  A Top 3 contract today is a Top 10 next season and a Top 15 by season 3. If you offer the QB12 a Top 15 contract today, he'd be one of the lowest paid veteran starting QBs by the end of the contract.
To be fair, Jimmy did that with his players to motivate them. But this does feel different than what Jimmy used to do. But maybe they've exhausted options?
They removed it because of it became public and the reactions to it were not good but honestly if that stayed in house they would’ve left it in because it sounds like he needs it in the contract to do the work lol
I agree, but that isn't what throwing someone under the bus is, at least not where I'm from. Where I'm from it's used as another way to say you turned someone in or reported them.
Feed him water and rice until he studies.
Ground him & take away his playstation
What aftermath?  The construction of the rest of the roster is what got him fired.
Keim got fired didn’t he?
Haha, why would anyone trade for Kyler at any price when his team is already trashing him when they can't reasonable expect a trade?  Dude is going to get cut as soon as they can and could even go the Baker route of being picked up mid season only to play great and be sent out the door again ..
Damn didn't make the connection until now but they Def have similarities  Wiggins had all the talent in the world and massive hype, and he just seemed like he didn't care   Until the Warriors came along...
Possibly  But in doing so you are also tanking his trade value & the teams leverage as the other GM knows you need to get rid of him
Most high level athletes aren't addicted to Call of Duty and yet here we are.
You are correct that that is not how high level motivated athletes work   It is how greedy overpaid & overrated players work
Keep telling yourself that. He's obviously very unmotivated to improve his performance.
Not how they generally work, sure, but we've seen plenty of cases where a guy just wants his payday and then his game completely falls off.
Burrow was playing 4D chess: trying to avoid his parents, or was holding out for a new phone
Ha that's awesome!  I went until age 32 before I got a cellphone, and only then because we were having a baby and my wife basically put her foot down (something hadn't done before or since) and said "if this baby is sick and I need to reach you, I better be able to".  Before that the best way to contact me was email - I had a land line but I avoided using it.
People just read into it too much. He was a college student pre-NIL and his phone broke. He didn’t have a phone until his parents bought him a new one. Sounds like a relatively typical college student experience.
cant you, like, watch film on a bike or treadmill too? combine conditioning into the prepping
I was going to remark on how QBs at least don't have to sit through commercials, but then I thought about how hilarious it would be if the cheapass Cardinals owners, who won't even buy their players food, also just DVR'd all the games and Kyler got fed up hearing "whopper whopper junior whopper" every 10 minutes during film study.
How can you be so content with the worst franchise in all of sports?
Big Barkley vibes
*I’m sorry Laaaarry*
Just like me, except for that last part.
He's not the Nuk he was 4 years ago but when they traded for him in 2019 he was unanimous top 3. Crazy how far he and Michael Thomas have fallen off in so short a time. Injuries suck
And go through drafting another QB? One of the dumbest things about this sub is people like you who think finding a top 10-15 QB is easy. Fucking delusional
Funny you don't see browns legends at ravens games then.
We were like the village horse in the early 90s super bowls. Everybody in the NFC east got a ride. Except the eagles.  Honestly, it was the cowboys who took sloppy thirds and fourths, right? By that time, our roster was aging, there was a ton of exasperation here we go again kind of feeling in Buffalo.  By the time you got to us, we were a demoralized, 100 yard stare, used up whore of a team. Just kind of going through the motions.   It was the Giants who got our best.
Disagree, dude kept his job after the DUI’s. He shoulda been fired a while ago and even then, Bidwill didn’t have the nuts. He ‘left’ and I’m not really sure if Bidwill actually asked him to leave
>You listed one anonymous source, Kelvin Beachum who is a bum and should not be employed by any serious organization, and Patrick Peterson...  So current/former players? Just like I said lol?  And PP and Beachum were both Kyler's teammates for multiple seasons. You can't just dismiss their opinions because you don't like them. I'd imagine they both know more about what Kyler's like behind the scenes than fans do. And PP didn't walk back his criticisms, he doubled down.   And the "anonymous player" story came from Michael Silver, not Florio or someone without sources. Silver labeled his source as a "veteran cardinals player," so I'm curious who that was. Which veteran cardinals player was on the team in 2022 when Kyler got his extension?  [I also thought that "heated exchange" last year between Kyler and Hopkins was interesting, even if it was a little over blown by the media. I think it highlights how Kyler can be passionate about the game but still lack the leadership that franchise QBs usually have.](https://youtu.be/gQoVktb_9JA?t=20)  Hopkins:  >"1, what you looking at bro?! What you see?"  >"C'mon bro that shit wide open! I'm trying to win."   Kyler:  >"I'm gonna get you the ball. Calm the fuck down!"  Not even saying Hopkins was right or wrong, but it seems he felt Kyler wasn't seeing the field well and was letting the offense down. Hopkins seems pretty mellow for a WR, so hearing him blow up like that out of frustration was pretty revealing in terms of how he honestly feels about Kyler imo.
>(one of which ran back what he said but ig we will ignore that)  Where did PP run back his comments?   His follow up clarification actually doubled down on his criticism (and I included that in my other post):  >"What I meant by my comment was **when you’re a franchise quarterback you have to carry yourself a certain way. So if you’re having bad body language, pouting, moping on the sideline, what type of energy do you think feeds off to your teammates?**  >"That’s what I meant about Kyler. He cares about himself because he’s not putting the team first. **When you make a bad throw, and you come off to the sideline, you’re dropping your shoulders, how do you think the defense feels? If our starting quarterback don’t have any energy, no fire, that we can win this game, how can we?** That’s what I meant about Kyler caring about Kyler..."  And while picking Rosen was bad, giving Kyler that insane contract may prove to be an even stupider move.  And OF COURSE Peterson is salty with your organization. Keim is a moron (you guys finally agree) who didn't even talk to Peterson on his way out, and Bidwill apparently hated Peterson so much he told his staff to put fan hate mail on Peterson's locker. That's some serious next level pettiness from an owner.  >According to ESPN's Kevin Seifert, **Peterson said he "routinely found disparaging emails from fans printed out and left on his chair during his final seasons in the Cardinals locker room."**  >He added that the **emails were addressed to team ownership** and contained "messages that ranged from his age to his tackling ability to threats to cancel season tickets as long as he remained on the roster."  >Per Seifert, **Peterson called it "mind-boggling" that someone within the Cardinals organization would want him to see those messages.** He added that he remembered wondering, "What did I do to deserve this from a fan?"
Or you go the Daniel Jones route and sign them to a reasonable deal.   You don't gotta dump Kyler but paying him top 3 money was always a bad decision.
You don't need a top 5 QB to win.  However there is no fucking way you can win with a top 12-18 QB while paying him top 3 money.  Go get a game manager for 5mil a year and surround him with quality talent on both sides of the ball and you can win a lot of fucking games.
Because it's not really about odds, orgs can actually develop quarterbacks and influence how good they are. Plus overpaying for a mid guy can be far more dangerous to a franchise than being bad and trying again.
No one does lol. You thinking they do shows you have no understanding of the point. People think it’s better to risk being bad to try and get one. Cause the potential benefit outways the risk. Especially so when the team your describing was just as shitty as the Texans. Who were risking it to try to get a top 5 QB.
Because they haven't been in QB purgatory for as long as us Commanders fans
>Why does everyone in this sub think that if you don't have a top 5 quarterback you can just go get one?  That's... Not what he said.
I'd still rather take that chance than have another half-decade of 8-10 win seasons with an average QB because "you can't let that guy go".  I know it's easy to say for a Chiefs fan now, but I was entirely on board with drafting Mahomes from day one, even though Smith was a competent enough QB.   You don't get anywhere in this league by playing it safe.
That also hasn't proven to be effective, though.  If the Ravens continue to play hardball and then hit on a draft pick and succeed with said draft pick, your point stands.  In the interim, the Ravens are a pretty bad team with Tyler Huntley running the offense.  There's not many franchise QBs available to be able to just go and pluck one from a tree. If you have someone who has the skillset to be a franchise QB (whether talking about Lamar or Kyler), you should do everything possible to leverage their prime for your team.   Until proven otherwise, doing anything else is remarkably irresponsible. Unless you have another franchise QB you can trade for/draft to plug and play.
I guess my point is Kyler is not worth it. Even if it becomes a top 10 contract 3 years from now.   Out of the top 10 QB contracts, 4 of them have won a super bowl, and 8 of them have won a playoff game.   Kyler Murray and Derek Carr are the only two who haven't won  literally anything.
I think it's a style that just doesn't work anymore.
Lol wtf are you even talking about. He’s a grown ass man. If they have problems with him they should has it out between themselves, not go tattle telling to the press every couple of weeks. Or if they really hate him so much, they shouldn’t have fucking signed him to that stupid contract.
Kyler plays like a shorter Kaep.  Dude even has his own fast running style that looks slow...
Every single contract is public for everyone to access once it is in the portal. What else did this incompetent front office expect when you have that in your franchise QB contract ?   No one disagree if Kyler is a shit QB and needs to work.  The point I’m making if you didn’t believe in him don’t give him the contract.
Cardinals reported their own franchise QB then gave a huge contract ?
“i can’t believe i’m paying for this!”  - kyler murray, probably 😂
Throw him in the Chokey for good measure.
Right now? Nah. Not a lot of teams would.   In two to three years who knows what’s going to be happening. Maybe Kyler fixes his shit and ends up having value or maybe we cut him who knows
Kinda surprising he didn't seem to have more drive. He's not just your standard elite athlete who grew up and was always far better than everyone. That was the case for him, but his parents were an NBA player and Olympic sprinter. They know all about being elite athletes and still needing to work your ass off to be successful. You'd think that would've been instilled in him. Just kinda odd. He had greatness written all over him.
I'm obviously a Celtics fan     If you had told me a few years ago that we'd make it to the finals... and that we would lose to the Warriors with Andrew Fucking Wiggins as their 2nd best player, I cannot imagine what face I would've made. Shows what a joke of a franchise the Wolves are and what a well run machine Golden State is
I wanna put you in a shaker because you're salty.
Burrow is Indian af with that move lmao
when the Chargers relocated to LA, Rivers still lived in SD, so he bought a tricked out SUV so the entire 90 mins ride up (and back) he could spend studying film.
I'm not sure if it's the same. However, for my uni exams I would listen to audio recording of my lectures while going on a jog and then quiz myself. If I can do it, I honestly can't see why a professional nfl QB can't study game film during a work out.
What? Where did you get that from my comment?
it’s not fucking dumb. You guys have been stuck with Kirk cousins and what has that gotten you? nothing. Time and time again it’s the top 5 competing for the championship year after year. Investing in anything outside of that is cost sunk. You can’t build a good enough team paying a QB outside the top 5 like if he is top 5. For the value that Baker went for you can sign him as a bridge and build a top defense or offense around him with that Kyler money and get to the same place or better.
I don’t know why people insist on the old browns are the ravens stuff. Both fans hate it and it makes no logical sense
Ozzie Newsome is their VP of player ops
Ozzie does attend the games
Did you even read what I or the guy I responded to wrote? That has nothing to do with what we were talking about.  The point of contention is how Keim got the job in the first place.
Lmao 2-for-2
Hopkins also tweeted "You don't kick a man when he's down" when Patrick Peterson said his garbage ass statements so you tell me how Hopkins feels about K1. Is Kyler perfect? Most definitely not. But I would take anything P2 and Kelvin Bumfuck Beachum says with a grain of salt.
This a weird attack lmfao. I’m defending Kyler, not the cards org. Weirdo 49ers fan tryna get some karma
That was not reasonable,  and he's much worse than Kyler
5 mil a year? Boy you living in the 90s
$5 mil? That’s Mariota money, good luck winning with that. A “game manager” is 3 years, $70mil like Jimmy G.
QB money is nuts these days, 5 mil gets you literally nothing that sets foots on the field
Real question, what “game manager” QB would you think can win the superbowl on $5M a year?  For reference, current (non rookie) QBs being paid that much are Tyler Heinicke, Tyrod Taylor, and Colt McCoy.
I am a commanders fan lol.
Agreed
Huntley definitely isn't a promising QB, but in the playoffs, Lamar has lost to the AFCCG loser by double digits twice. Huntley nearly knocked off the Bengals last year. Lamar doesn't throw consistently enough to win in the playoffs. He's good enough of an athlete to elevate mediocre teams into wild card teams. That's proven to be his ceiling to this point in his career. The team is coaches well enough for that to be near their floor anyway, looking at Harbaugh's tenure over the past 15 years. He's made the playoffs 10 times and had a losing record twice.
the mindset of pay anyone who is a "franchise QB" any amount of money is such a low IQ take from fans.  It's obvious from even a cursory look at the data that this is a stupid move most of the time.
How do you know they’re not saying these things to Kyler behind closed doors? Maybe he’s not listening.
Yeah I get what you’re saying, giving that much money to someone you think isn’t doing the required amount of work is really dumb but franchise QBs don’t fall off trees so I guess they were investing in his potential and hoping the clause would sort out his lack of work ethic. I would’ve respected them more if they left the clause in rather than caving to Public outcry tbh
Who did they report him to?
You can have aptitudes and be physically built for a sport or activity but you can still not enjoy it. Do you think all NBA players “love” basketball?
When that money hits the account people react differently.
You old enough to remember Albert Haynesworth?
Never said i like Kirk as the guy. I would love to have Kyler though, and if you’re saying Baker & Kyler are in the same tier then this isn’t even worth arguing, so i’ll leave it at have a nice day man.
He moved with the team bud.
I'm aware.  That's 1, and he moved with the team.
Maybe that isn’t how he got there, but that’s definitely how he stayed there for so long. He’s been awful for a long time and should’ve been shown the door a while ago.
Yeah but Hopkins also could've easily defended Kyler and said he is a great leader, but he didn't do that.   I agree with Hopkins that if you're Kyler's teammate it's not a good look to shit on him publicly when he's already dealing with a bunch of external criticism too.   But it doesn't make the criticism any less true.
He is worse, but they only guaranteed like half the deal and there were other performance-based incentives in it.   Kyler's deal is nearly $100 million more than Jones' and has the two additional years, plus more guaranteed money.
Yet somehow Jones has had more playoff success than Kyler.
Seahawks just gave Geno 25 mil a year but yeah just go find a game manager for 20% of that lmao
That's about what Daniel Jones deserved
And that was cheap for him because of injuries, a good game manager is like 30-35 million minimum now
There are a lot of backup QBs making more than that, even QBs on rookie contracts often make more than that. That guy is delusional.
Heinigoat you mean
This is an incredibly misleading comment.     >Lamar has lost to the AFCCG loser by double digits twice  So has a lot of qb's. Aaron Rodgers, Drew Brees, Peyton Manning; Pretty much everybody has been blown out in the playoffs at one point or another. And not just to superbowl winning teams.     >Huntley nearly knocked off the Bengals last year  Huntley barely did shit. That game was close because of their defense. Plus it was a divisional matchup. AJ McCarron was the qb in the Bengals near win vs the Steelers in 2015. He was certainly not better than Dalton.      &nbsp;
His ceiling is, at the lowest, league MVP and #1 seed in the AFC.
I don’t know you tell me, you’re the one that said where you’re from that is called turning them in or reported
Yeah. That's fair. Their dad might've pushed them towards basketball since they all played college basketball, but you'd think they would've been supported in any endeavors, especially with their mom being more successful in a sport other than basketball. And Wiggins could've been successful in any sport he chose. He's 6'8" with like a 4.4 40 and 44 inch vertical lol
He was still ROY
And Jamarcus Russell. It's not my money idgaf if they cash in on their talent then check out. NFL = Not For Long
Also completely beside the point.
More years is generally just upside for the team, and they can be out of the contract in 2025 if they really want to according to spotrac. Kyler also actually looked like a top 5 Qb at points in his career, he is much better than Jones. The two shouldn’t be compared.
Kyler and the cardinals looked like the best team for a while two years ago. Jones is just along for the ride not comparable at all.
Give it time. Jones is an absolute bin and has already peaked
Jones had close to 1000 yards of total offense in 2 games against the vikings defense last year. If he played literally anyone else in the playoffs then he never would’ve won that game
Getting curb stomped every time you've played in the divisional round kinda shows you're a wild card peak. His statistical anomaly season in 2019 was phenomenal, but he never played nearly that well before that season and hasn't since either.
True, but I also said that they didn't throw him under the bus.
The Big Ben Steelers always blew it when they had to play in Oakland.
Dear God, we're at an offseason low point if we're posting Bruce Gradkowski highlights  But like a pathetic addict looking for any kind of bump, I'm still here
This game was unbelievable. One of my favorites of the last 20 years of hell.
The scrappiest QB I’ve ever seen, unironically. Not much skill but had passion.
Damn what an insane final 9 minutes of a game.
I dunno if there was a single team Big Ben seemed to struggle with more than the Raiders. Being from CA and knowing a lot of raiders fan, boy did I hear it when they played
This was one of my favorite games of that particularly terrible era  Fuck what anyone says, we love BRUUUUUCE
Bruce Almighty
Today just got better.
I remember watching this game live with my Steelers fan dad. What a good Sunday.
FIFTEEN point upset, OOF  That's roughly like if the Texans beat the Chiefs last season
This is one of my favorite non-Seahawk regular season games of all time.   Also, somewhere out there is a post-game interview with Bruce where he is so happy. He is a native of Pittsburgh and he was talking about his family coming out and making the team food and just having a great time.
Even though it was one of like two games Ben beat us, watching Seymour clock him brought me palpable happiness.
Jamarcus Russell was better
Go Gata
Bruce and his family were huge Steelers fans and his dad's interview after was one of my favorites ever.
why does this statline exist
He's the current offensive coordinator for the St. Louis Battlehawks and he's doing a pretty good job.  I love getting to hear him call plays.
Been a Raiders fan my whole life. Never heard of Tom Wilson
Homecoming
Dude, you didn’t have to post this, ya know. We already know how the Big Ben-era Steelers fared against the Raiders
One of my favorite random NFL facts is this man threw AJ Green his first touchdown reception.
Caption confuses me. Is he the first to throw 3 come from behind TDs? Or was he the first to do it vs his hometown team?
This one was in Pittsburgh, too. Big Ben was 2-6, 2-2 in Pittsburgh and 0-4 in Oakland.
Steelers-Raiders are a good AFC rivalry
It was the trap pick in survivor pools.
This was in Pittsburgh, but the same thing is true
I might be wrong but I’m pretty sure Ben legitimately never beat the raiders in his career. Either that or he never beat them in their stadium  Edit - he did beat them twice in Heinz but never during an away game, one of the few franchises Ben didn’t get an away win against
Mr. Blown Coliseum
Ben Roethlisberger had four games against the Raiders with a passer rating of 120.0 or higher. His record in those games was 1-3.
They always played to the level of the opposition.
You shut your whore mouth before we bring back the Tomsula era
This was eye opening to me as a fan who started watching in 2003 and thinks the game hasn’t changed that much. “That was a *clean* helmet-to-helmet hit!” at 2:27 is such a paradoxical statement now, but back then, it was just “football”.    Wild.
Same friend. And we haven't even made it to the dead zone yet. O_o
"If your quarterback was a soda, what brand would they be?"
It’s been a dark time
He might not have had all the talent but you could tell he was giving his all every time he took a snap. Will always love the Polish Rocket from Toledo.
We didn't have much else going for us tbf
It wasn't even necessarily his fault. He had four games against the Raiders with a passer rating of 120.0 or higher (2009, 2010, 2012, 2018), but a record of 1-3 in those games. Two other losses (2013, 2021) were total team failures, where no phase of the game played well. One loss was all on him (2006), but I maintain that he shouldn't have even been allowed to play in that game, given that he suffered a concussion in the previous game against the Falcons.
My favorite seahawk game of all time is SEA vs BAL in 2019.
He had won against all teams except the Raiders for a long time and finally ended that eventually
We should’ve thrown him out there on some piss poor defenses we had it anything just to get in the way of receivers and tight ends
I wanted that idiot to succeed so badly
Hey I was happy for you guys hahah I was at the game in Oakland when Terrell Pryor opened the game with that 98 yard rushing TD
Hard to argue with any of your points there. Always seemed like they would play down to the Raiders, because many of those year Oakland ultimately had a losing record anyways. They weren’t amazing teams, but the Steelers struggled anyways
His birthname was William Gonorrhea.
The horny meme lives on
….why? Are they out of blocking dummies for practice?
Will Clapp….dem cheeks lol
Jason Garrett wanted that guy so badly when he was coming out
Jeb approves
He likes to eat.  His motto is "Will Clapp for Food."
>Will Clapp  What's typed on Jason Garrett's resume under qualifications
Herbert: Yes, we got the Clapp.
Gordon must be a proud papa
Did he Clapp back?
Dem cheeks.
Something tells me this team needs a Jason Garrett on it's payroll.
Will Clapp dem cheeks
Or won’t he clap?
How can he Clapp?!?
But what Will Clapp? Mo Cheeks?  I’ll show myself out
Jason Garrett fuming, driving around town
#ESPN: CHARGERS GOT CLAPP
Will Will Clapp Clap?
Jimmy Dugan warned them against this.
Fantastic name
Chargers got the Clapp?   Isn’t this what team Drs are for?
So when he pulls do they call it a Clapp Trapp
I came in expecting a joke like this and I still am laughing so hard.
Will Clap your mum Will Clap your dog Will Clap everyone
It's a good change! That's a *good* change.
His cousin is Bill Applause!
Hey.. at least he’s not as bad as New Orleans Saints legend Storm Norton
It's Ironic. His name is Clapp but as a Center it's his Cheeks that get Clapped.
Rumor has it he summoned him.
Please Clapp
The last doc with a needle deflated someone's lung. Don't get that needle near yah dick
I was expecting "LA got the Clapp" to be precise, but this was better.
I came here to see jokes about STDs, cheeks, and Jeb, and Reddit didn't disappoint
Is he that bad?
Clapp started 10 games in 5 years. Norton started 18 in 4. Clapp is probably the worse of the two.
Well yeah, it's Will's cheeks that clapp.
Hes… so bad
He got Herbert’s ribs cracked and then lost his job to a 6th round rookie who was drafted to play guard lol  Edit: I don't think it was his guy on the ribs but the second part is true
However bad you think Clapp is/was Norton is about 3 times worse than that. The Chargers did everything possible last season to *not* put him on the field.
I would scream at my tv whenever he took the field.  May the force be with you... you'll need it.
Storm Norton is like an extremely popular Highschool bully. He’s got a beautiful name to match the Chargers, but completely bullies Herbert by letting him get drilled on every single fucking snap.
That would be incorrect. Storm started those games because we counted on 78 year old Bryan Bulaga to stay healthy for a whole season twice. He made it roughly 20 snaps into each.
I feel like there are about 10 fanbases per year that have to sit through at least one linemen that has no business being in the NFL and talk about it a lot. For example, we had Matt Pryor this year and I think my eyes are still bleeding. Wish we could pick up a bunch of those guys and have them start for the Browns or something.
Yeah IIRC it was Zion misdiagnosing a stunt that got Herbert injured. Cant find a full clip anymore tho
Salyer played extremely well tbh
Honestly, I feel bad criticising players in overly harsh terms. They are dudes doing their jobs, it's a brutal sport and the NFL is an absurdly high level. I typically try to no go overboard with player hating.  Norton really tested me though.
Clapp is that bad lol
We had both on the field at the same time. Storm was way worse
He played several games for us last season & wasn’t terrible. Every snap Norton played was “red alert! Herbert about to die!” clapp is certainly a backup but it wasn’t on that level
Yeah idk what the guy above is saying. Clapp was a serviceable back up for us
Yeah sandwiched between two above average guards helped Clapp out too.
Probably one of the worst run defenders in the league.  I'm hoping we don't see too many snaps with him on the field with Solomon Thomas who also belongs in that conversation for worst run defender in the NFL.  Please tell me that Seattle runs a different scheme and things will get better with Jets forcing him to only play 1-gap
On the phone with my proctologist, telling him about my Canadian girlfriend. He says I’m full of shit.
I truly appreciate her unwavering dedication to the bit.
“Spoke with” “Texted with” “On the phone with” oook Josina…
the fuck with Josina's eyes?
On one of the worst defensive lines last season, he was at the bottom of it.
Narrator: "They weren't."
Is this the guy who was washed and useless for us like 4 years ago?
He also mentioned Rodgers on the offense, so Jets are using Rodgers to recruit guys to the point that it'll be just absolutely hilarious if the trade falls through.
They aren't taking over anything.  Miami got alot better already this off-season especially on defense.. Buffalo didn't get worse. Plus the jets traded their best young wr to try and bring In old ass Rodgers habahab
He’s kinda like the inverse Nwosu and had way better counting stats than what you expected watching the games. I think everyone was surprised to hear he ended with 5.5 sacks  last season even on a horrid Seahawks line he really didn’t pop at all during games
Fascinated by Josina's phone conversations. Glad to hear she isn't emailing like some amateur
J.E.T.S ...jets jets jets
Crazy that Solomon Thomas turned out to mostly be a bust. He was the best defender in the draft a few years ago.  Goes to show none of these guys is 100% safe
Well they also had arguably the least talented DL in the league. Here he can just be more disruptive alongside Q and JFM and the rest
The Jets DL without him was already showing great effectiveness toward the end of last season. If they keep the main pieces the same, he's a rotational guy for you that can shine intermittently without having to be relied upon. That's my positive thinking anyway. This is why you add guys that are only good at one thing as down-specific guys. He can add to your team in that way.
Top 5 pressure rates among DTs in 2022 (140 qualifiers):  1. Javon Hargrave (12.6%) - 57 pressures on 453 pass rush snaps  2. Chris Jones (12.4%) - 77 on 620  3. Quinnen Williams (12.4%) - 52 on 420  4. Dexter Lawrence (12.3%) - 63 on 513  5. Quinton Jefferson (11.7%) - 42 on 360  https://twitter.com/Michael_Nania/status/1644087684275609602?t=OhSb6iJD1dV2LiFsS2vvTg&s=19
>Probably one of the worst run defenders in the league.   Yeah, he really sells-out to get pressure.
Do you prefer “sources say” where sources could be totally made up
Same with the Bills. Absolutely invisible...we cut him after 1 season on a 2 year deal with guarantees remaining
It might be one of the worst rushing defenses of all time. TB put up 200 yards.
He’s dreadfully bad.
Youre getting downvoted by (probably) Jets fans. But dude has been terrible the last few seasons
Hey how’s Ed Oliver boogie basham and aj apenesa doing?
If the trade falls through, the Packers are fucked
I'm sure they didn't want to but they couldn't risk losing the Quinton Jefferson sweepstakes
Packers fans are fucking weirdos
Did you actually just say Elijah Moore is better than  Garrett Wilson? Absolute clown comment lmao
Dolphins 7 win season incoming
Also goes to show that people should be appreciative of average-above average play and not tie in “bust” because someone didn’t reach an All Pro expectation.
> Well they also had arguably the least talented DL in the league.  ...and he was probably the worst of the group week in and week out.  Like, I don't think he legitimately had a single memorable play all season.  Seattle pretty much let all of their interior defensive linemen walk.
Sounds like cope to me.
He was really bad here too.
I would be over the moon if all of her tweets started with "Per source (me)" from now on.
"Yes. I wish that." - Lord Denethor, probably
Damn, Tom must've been fucking exhausted after all that running
Everybody who has paid him made a huge mistake
Epenesa had 6 sacks while playing less than 50% of defensive snaps last year...
Ed Oliver is elite in one on ones but easy to double team. Epenesa had a pretty outstanding pressure rate last year, especially down the stretch. And Basham is no worse than his draft profile projected him to be - he’s ok. They all were chosen over Quinton Jefferson who produced 3 sacks on a $13.5M contract…
No disagreement, I'm mainly bored and half the time entertained by the idea of the most chaotic thing happening (particularly when I know that thing is super unlikely).
says the person who willingly roots for the jets.
He really was awful lmao
He’s depth for $1-2 million. No one cares enough to cope
I like Rousseau. Feel like he's gonna be a consistent double digit sack guy
Know what, I respect it. This entire leverage war has gotten stale might as well spice it up in some threads 🫡
I’m just a pot calling the kettle black
Jets fans downvoting it anyway while they get his HoF jacket dusted off
He definitely could do it. Jefferson had 3 sacks in his season with us - brutal for what we paid him.
Yea Rousseau is a beast
fair enough.
A jets fan is the one leading this post by saying how awful he was lmaooo.
Immediately followed by a Jets fan saying he'll do better lmaoooooo
It’s a huge leap to go from “more disruptive (with a more talented D-Line around him)” to “dusting off his HOF jacket”
[Huh](https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=hyperbole)
What’s with the knowing wink?
He has shined as a pass rusher at time, atrocious in run D unfortunately.
Remember Quinton Jammer. He couldn't catch.
Very good pass rushing 5 tech. Absolutely atrocious run defending 5 tech
So fuck the Aaron Rodgers trade now I’m guessing?
The Seahawks and the Jets, destined to send eachother their disappointments for all eternity.  He will be good next year and then regress to his disappointment form. ‘Tis foretold in the Book of Pete.
Jets have been busy
Oh you know. 😉
He's joined to play with Rodgers I'm Guessing
Well that’s upsetting
Fine by me, our biggest weakness on D maybe specialist pass rusher for third downs.
I doubt teams are spending big on last seasons Seahawks DLinemen
What does Aaron Rodgers have to do with this signing
Na he mentioned rodgers as a reason he signed with the jets. Lol. No joke.
Quinton Jefferson would be disappointed  https://twitter.com/JosinaAnderson/status/1644086753190395905
Nah, it’s gonna be a sign and trade for Williams now. Plus 3 first round picks and Zach Wilson’s first born
Aaron Rodgers in shambles
Lol, it seems like someone got a handy under the table or something.
That’s sarcasm right?
Not sure Rodgers wants to go somewhere where he'll struggle to get snaps at DT
Everything
U can have Zach Wilson’s whole bloodline and two 3rds, enjoy.
Which one of Zach Wilson’s MILF is carrying his firstborn?
Do Packers fans honestly think that the Jets would trade Quinnen Williams?
People hate jokes
You are a living, breathing example of why people put /s on the most obvious jokes of all time
Lol no.
I thought the first born part would help people realize it was joke.
I mean the dude is getting it from somewhere, I didn't say he was specifically being serious. Obviously the 3 first round pick bit was sarcasm
No there are legitimate packers fans that think that
And there are jets fans that think they'll get Rodgers for a conditional 4th, all fanbases contain morons
Didn't this happen like a week ago?
Ayyyyyyyyyyy just stay healthy bro
The man, the myth, the legend
Twice in one off-season? Sweet..
He’s a great player when healthy
Fuck Jordan Phillips
Yes
He won't but he'll be great for the 4 games he plays
Jordan Phillips wasn’t the problem  Keim giving him the deal he did was
Why not both? Phillips loafed the entire time he was here.
I don't know why but Jordan always plays amazing when he's in a Bills defense. A game or two per year he's the best player on the field straight up.
Yep, he balled out as soon as he put the Bills jersey back on. Dude took plays off all the time when he was a Cardinal, when he actually played. It was maddening.
Here’s the part where everyone says how dog shit the player is while fans of his new team are yelling ITS JUST A DEPTH MOVE!!!
In Evero we trust
 This the dude that Belichick played over Butler against the Eagles and got cooked repeatedly
Very elite at allowing a catch and then making the tackle. Congrats on your new undersized lb
I'm not sure I've ever seen worse safety play than when Rowe was forced in after Brandon Jones went down, so I wouldn't be expecting much from him. He had a couple of good years but totally fell off a cliff.
Decent veteran I guess?
Was best used against TEs, plays for his team, forced a couple fumbles
Super Bowl
He's really good at covering shitty tight ends.
Good player, great teammate. Sorry to see him go.
He was the guy in coverage on that crazy Julio Jones catch in SB51. He was OK but I didn't realize he switched to safety
He stinks at playing safety
He played well for us  good player
Panthers ~~North~~ South
Ah he's a safety now.
Former "fileted by Calvin Johnson for 3 TDs his rookie year and never recovered" player.
He is good depth with low end starter capabilities. Definitely a solid guy to have for a Defense
I mean it is a depth move though lol. We have Vonn Bell and Xavier Woods at the safety spots and Jaycee Horn and Donte Jackson at CB with CJ Henderson as the #3 and Jeremy Chinn as a hybrid type of player.  MAYBE they are bringing him in a situational nickel guy but I’d be pretty surprised if this was anything more than a break in case of emergency type of player.
I’m having flashbacks to the 21 season where we signed cam Erving and Pat Elflein and they stated through the year. We had the second worst line in the league.
He is certainly solid depth that can handle starting if needed to. Not a terrible pickup.
It’s just a depth move
He's a good depth guy, at times he's been okay, though definitely seemed in the way when he played last year
Be good to him
He’s also the dude Chip Kelly smugly thought he could leave on an island against Megatron as a rookie, and he got cooked repeatedly
To be fair, he played CB back then. Horrible CB. Passable SS.
At CB he was decent for a few years   Look at the score of that superbowl. Refs weren't calling holding whatsoever so neither team could play defense
Yeah terrible signing. Top 3 least fav Pats of all time. Closely behind Kyle Arrington.
Yeah he’s just a depth piece.
He caught a TD in Brady's last regular season game as a Pat so you've got that going on for him
He’s just depth with SB experience. Don’t mind it.
Was just going to ask, has he been any better at safety than he was when he was at corner… because he was not good at corner. Didn’t know he switched
CJ is such a liability we can’t depend on that dude to do anything
I still have flashbacks from signing Haruki Nakamura...
That was not a happy thanksgiving
At CB he was decent for a few years   Look at the score of that superbowl. Refs weren't calling holding whatsoever so neither team could play defense
He was depth for us too, still ended up getting good playing time lol. He’s shite
Meta
He's actually about to be harvested for spare parts so that Jackson might live again
You're thinking of Elandon Roberts
That was a playoff game sir
I mean you still want your depth to not be dog shit right? That SB experience didn’t matter much for us the past couple seasons lol
Was very useful for us in his first season but really fell off last year.
We’re probably drafting a CB at some point in the draft to replace CJ.
CJ is a good 4th CB. Anything more is a massive liability.
I don’t know much about the situation with Henderson but it’s not like you guys are gonna be contending this year and he’s only 24, no matter how bad he’s been isn’t it worth giving a high pick that’s so young another chance? Especially considering that this is a house money type of year?
Now that’s a name I haven’t thought about in a long time. Wasn’t it his fault Matt Ryan got to do the, “get the fuck off my field!” quote?
What are you on about, the guy is horrendous
Everyone died last year, Tua died like 3 times!
In fairness to Rowe, last year was probably his worst year with us. He wasn’t bad before.
We literally had to sign Josh Norman off the street last year because of injuries.  At least Rowe was in the league last year, has to be an upgrade over bringing in Norman in a pinch(just to go out and help us lose to TB and miss the playoffs).
Given he still played in New England in 2019 I'm certain that was not Elandon Roberts
No thats Logan Ryan
He’s literally the 6th safety on our roster or the 7th CB on our roster, he’ll likely never see the field other than special teams and if he does we’re already in deep shit regardless.
Yeah CB in the draft is a must IMO between Donte’s injury and CJ’s suckage
I watched the games, he was a decent CB2/3   Haven't watched him since he left the pats  From our super bowl win:  "The Patriots secondary was the same we’ve seen before FS Devin McCourty, SS Patrick Chung, CB Malcolm Butler, and CB Logan Ryan played all 49 defensive snaps. CB Eric Rowe (32, 65%) generally played against the Falcons 11 personnel (3 wide receivers), while FS Duron Harmon (29, 59%) usually played against the Falcons 12 personnel (2 tight ends and/or fullback)."  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.patspulpit.com/platform/amp/2017/2/6/14522294/super-bowl-li-snap-counts-patriots-superior-conditioning-wears-down-falcons-defense
Yeah last year was really rough. The fact we ended up making the playoffs and almost beating the bills was incredible lol
In further fairness to Rowe, he was asked to be Brandon Jones even though he definitely isn’t Brandon Jones.
You worded it kind of awkwardly. Eric Rowe had a pick six. Elandon Roberts "caught a TD".
Whoops
Our depth at safety must have been dog shit then bc I think he was our backup or third stringer, don’t let that man see the field lol
I was never upset abt the trade til the end of last year.  I never expected him to live up to his top 10 pick hype but man at least be worth a 3rd.
Is a must?  What picks do we have to attain this CB?  No. 93?  Dude will be butt juice.  We need somebody in free agency.
And your season was really weird. Somehow, you found a way to balance your record.   3-0   3-3   8-3   8-8   9-8 (regular season finish)  9-9 (after playoffs)
We have #39 and it’s not out of the realm of possibility we go CB there depending on how the draft goes. Butt juice would still be an upgrade over CJ
You call it balance. I call it the last 22 years of mediocrity. Granted, last year was the first year I had hope and have actual expectations for next year.
Can we stop saying butt juice
Look, I'm not on the Trey Lance will suck wagon but slow motion shots only skew perspective. Just show the pass normally.
People counting him out but imo he's already a top 5 QB in NFCW
Why can’t we ever get an unedited and cinematic view of stuff like this. I can’t even tell how good the throw was
Awesome video. Great size. Look thick. Solid. Tight. Keep us all posted on your continued progress with any new progress pics or vid clips. Show us what you got man. Wanna see how freakn' huge, solid, thick and tight you can get.
Holy shit he threw a football
Literally impossible to tell. It's a slow-mo video and you barely see anything except the ball lol.
Based on this video I can reasonably conclude that Trey Lance is the greatest and most physically gifted player to ever enter into any sport
Should've shown the clip that [wasn't in slow motion ](https://wompampsupport.azureedge.net/fetchimage?siteId=7575&v=2&jpgQuality=100&width=700&url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.kym-cdn.com%2Fphotos%2Fimages%2Fnewsfeed%2F001%2F207%2F210%2Fb22.jpg)
I think it's tough to say but it's worth it to speculate based off this single clip. I'm gonna say it's got precision milled tolerances, knurled steel, and an anodized exterior finish. I think it would be smart to start him next year assuming you can get a competitive APR and can afford 36 month financing.
Idk, a quick release is important and he just looks so slow in the video
He's back, and this time; it's personal
It’s like he’s moving in slow motion.  I don’t care how good that OL is he’s going to get killed  /s
Really can’t tell from this angle. But damn, I hope he got rid of that flutter stuff on his deep passes. That’s one of the weirder things I’ve seen from someone with such a big arm.
I don't care, I just love looking at a good slow motion spiral.
Now let's decide everything about Trey based on one professionally produced video of a single throw.
From that camera angle and slow motion style it’s hard to tell if this new throwing motion has somehow corrected his inaccuracy as a passer or his penchant for squaring up against linebackers who are NFL caliber and not Central Arkansas caliber.
LAMESTREAM media trying to push a narrative that Lazy Lance has the slightest chance of seizing the job from our GEQBUS!  QBanon soldiers stand back and stand by!
Few things in life I enjoy with my morning coffee more than perusing Reddit and reading about the NFL so I can be on Reddit, clicking on a link to a Twitter post, that’s a video from Instagram.
he's going to be a nice backup to Purdy
Ben Simmons off-season practice flashbacks
Idk. He’s not better than Brock Purdy tho.
Is this gonna be a Tua situation all over again?
Trey looking real toight
Best shape of his life
Ben Simmons shooting jump shots
Glad to see him getting healthy, the trade to move up to draft him is still awful though.
We need a better system for disseminating video clips. The NFL should like officially release them or something cause I'm so sick of only edited bullshit like this getting released constantly
Oh is it time already for the yearly “is Lance good” speculation?
Lmao bust cope
You people in the comments are insane. If this proves anything its that he is a top 5 QB next year at his floor.
He still looks like a bust
Got that *Rookie of the Year* surgery.
The Uncle Rico films better
I personally wanna see Lance win mvp and end up being an all star hof qb. Just after the niners trade him somewhere
Look how good this one pass in slow motion is!
He’s not it guys, never will be. Brock Purdy is exceptionally average and looked miles better last year.
QB1
https://i.imgflip.com/7hb6q1.jpg
In other news, the 49ers are totally not entertaining trade offers for Trey Lance.
It's really easy to modify your release in no pressure situations where all you have to do is focus on the release itself.  I'm real games guys who are in their 20s will almost certainly revert back to their natural throwing motion.
I will only belive it once we get the daily 7 on 7 stats. /s
It seems a lot slower
6 seconds is too long to be holding the ball in the pocket. Kid is going to get killed.
The real improvement is that Trey dropped the yeye ass haircut and embraced the baldness.
He doesn’t look good
THAT'S MY QB ;(
His issue is his play under pressure. Guy can run and throw pretty well he just cant do both those things under pressure.
Everything is better in slow motion, like Chappelle said.
Exactly.  Not only is it slow motion but the angle makes it seem like the pass traveled a long distance.  I'm betting it's like a 5 yard out.
I am on the Trey Lance will suck wagon, however that looks like a fine pass, little long on the windup but not terrible imo. great spiral though. granted based on the what looks like a 3 step drop that's probably a 10-15 yard pass. actually I think 15/20 based on the hitch WR are incredibly fast with no coverage or pads, he looked one way then back, a nfl wr can get 20 yards downfield in that time. 4.4 forty means about 15ish yards in 2 seconds.
I think that’s the tightest spiral I’ve ever seen him throw though
You should be on the wagon
He might not be a top 5 QB on his own team at the rate the 49ers are going. They're going to have:  1. Brock Purdy 2. Kirk Cousins 3. Mac Jones 4. GEQBUS 5. Christian McCaffrey Emergency Wildcat 6. Trey Lance
Don’t you dare count drew lock out.
He's barely even a top 5 QB on his team
Because the photographer's job is to make cinematic views like this
Honest answer in this specific case, Lombardi is a notorious Niners homer and Lance Stan. He shares a LOT of interesting info, very analytical, great writer, overall very good at his job and one of my go-tos… but when it comes to Lance he’s purely emotional. He’ll spin anything to make it pro Lance.
Cuz his agent had this made for when he requests a trade in august.
Feel like they’re always picky about what they release, idk why in the off-season
He's fucking built too. Thick and man made. You can tell he's sculpted because you can see it thru the pads. His fucking vice grip thighs. Suffocating thighs. Rock hard thighs. Piping hot thighs. Great arms. Great abs. A stocky chest. Love the progress his body has made throughout his youth and now as a willing eager adult
Troy Aikman, is that you?!?
Ayo.
Holy shit this is a classic
I need to see what's going on underneath that hat.
MISC
r/bodybuilding leaking
Big if true
I don’t know what else you need to see but he looks gold jacket ready IMO.
Give some credit, you also see some random head get right in the way in the middle of the shot lol
This was pretty much his scouting report even tho he only threw the ball like 12 times in college
Thank you for posting it
Definitely looks improved. That release is pretty quick
The real MVP 🙏
To me it looks like it’s actually gotten a bit slower…
Im going to cry
It’s never going away, is it?
You promise it won’t get rusty after I get this running for a month?
I agree, his motion is waaaaay too slow
Nothing personnel, kid.
If the balls he throws are that slow, even I could intercept him
Is he better than Brady based on this throw? Who says no?
Doesn't Brock already have a backup? Maybe he can be the third string?
We probably won’t know that till the end of the year at least, he’s still 21(?), will be 22 to start the season next year
Man, why are fans such cringey losers?
(Wrong QB)
He’d probably be the best jets QB of the last 30 years based on this throw
I thought the same and was cheering, but checked his Insta and it appears he still has the cut but he has trimmed it.
c'mooooon titty
Except major league pitching, that shit looks nasty.
Not everything, what about watching someone taking a shit?
Furthermore we have seen a number of QBs who "fixed" their throwing motion in underwear football during the summer, but once the bullets started to fly they immediately reverted back to the way it was before.
I watched the video after reading your comment. You’re right it look like an 8-10 yard slant route. I don’t even think the guy who is so close out of focus is even the guy who catches the ball. It’s a weird video, maybe I’m taking a nose dive here but if they release a slowed down video maybe they’re hiding something. But why would they, ot doesn’t make any sense. It’s probably just a marketing manager swinging and missing haha
That shit is AI. Nice try
Lol that’s bullshit, he can throw a tight spiral, just not consistently
Really? You’ve never once seen him throw a tight spiral before this?
You forgot Aaron!
Cant wait until they trade for Lamar. Should make the starting QB competition REALLY exciting.
How many football games has trey lance played since high school. I’m telling you it’s got to be like 25, combined.
You forgot Tom Brady mysteriously returning.  We've got all the meme QBs.
Sam Darnold is coming for 2nd best qb on the 9ers already
Yea he has his uses but if he's pushing the Niners HARD I usually just tune it out
LANCE STAN???? LOMBARDI??? Lombardi is 100% a homer but he was a Jimmy G ride or die. Lombardi has said plenty of critical things about Trey, and they stand out because he hardly says anything critical things about the 49ers ever
His treatment of Lance is a symptom of the more general issue, which is that despite the things he brings to the table he's generally toady and comes off as a homer.   I can't tell if he's just very online and has rotted his brain a tad over the years responding to insane fan overreactions, or if carrying water for the org is the lane he has carved out for himself (it's a pretty crowded coverage landscape he's competing in, and nobody else is really angling for our occupying that position).
Must have been painful for Lombardi to track completion percentage in last years camp. Lance was in the 40-49% range for most of the camp.
I feel like they should be more picky. Remember the time Tua underthrew someone once last year?
Great post
Retire his jersey number already!
You mother fucker. I clicked it because of you lol
I just don’t see it, I’d probably trade for Rodgers.
Flight, flight, feed, freeze, fuck. Those are the options.
49ers run nothing personnel most in the league.
It's his third year, so it's getting kind of old that people act like we can't judge him for what he is at this point until he proves otherwise.  You don't see project QBs last more than 3 years before teams move on, and after 2 years, it's not an excuse to still be raw and inexperienced, it's a problem.  We do not have to wait unti "at least" the end of the year before Lance either produces or he doesn't. Enough excuses, Niners fans should be more impatient than anyone.
How’s that cringey?
Probably
The looks on the pitchers faces is hilarious though
[still pretty lit](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*7ymz8IMq6dRWKapOQAs5dQ.png)
You can tell because of the hands
Point to where I said he couldn’t
Never said that
Tom Brady about to send out an emotional tweet
Did you know Aaron was passed up by the 49ers in the draft? Even though he was a hometown kid? What a crazy world we live in!
u/Treemags confirms Aaron Jones to the 49ers
Trey Lance hasn't ever played a football game, he's a baseball pitcher the 49ers accidentally drafted.
Many people, smart people, are saying the GEQBUS is the best quarterback on the 49ers. Folks we know its true, everyone is saying its true!
He’s generally amazing at what he does, but he will eventually stick his fingers in his ears and shout “LA LA LA LA” if someone presses him on something negative around the team.   It really bothers me. Meanwhile Maiocco just doesn’t give a fuck and will tell it how it is lol
I think it's firmly both. I'll wake up to tweet notifications from him to see that he was arguing with some dude with 15 followers at 3am and I think he's leveraging his platform into a stronger relationship with the FO.   He's breaking news before others at this point, he's taken that throne from Maiocco and ran with it.
How can anyone forget?  Felt like it was all the talking heads had to go on about for a month.  Same with his Concussions/Not Concussions (dude does need to learn how to fall better though)
I started a gofundme so we can build a statue of him on Roger Goodell’s lawn.
I mean, there’s just minimal tape. It’s like me asking you to buy my car off Craigslist but not letting you know what’s under the hood. The reason I say “at least” is because he could take a massive step forward this year, but we still don’t know if he’d be worth the trade
It's one of the things that [Patrick](https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/09/1200/675/GettyImages-1423162577.jpg?ve=1&tl=1) inherited from his [Dad.](https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/06/27/PSIF/e8f5e754-a51d-449f-adfc-590db2916b67-thumbnail_mahomes3.jpg?width=1280&height=1012&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp)
He’s thrown spirals just like this in the past lol

Of who he is willing to backup
Lol did you not see my flair? Of course I know our boy’s a 9ers fan. Better than chiefs legend Alex Smith
Arson Judge
Sources saying GEQBUS intends to further his greatness to new heights, winning ANOTHER Super Bowl without even throwing the ball himself. His mere presence will inspire the team. 20-0 season imminent.
Hey, don't talk shit about my copium dealer
Yeah exactly hahaha
That's a really good point. It can be both and doesn't have to be either or at all.
Quick, check if he'll lend his number to Rodgers if he comes to play for the 49ers.
Fuck, I lose it everytime he does that. What if he bites that tongue.
Bro, I was just complementing how tight his release and spiral were

“Top Five QB I would backup: Dylan, Dylan, Dylan Dylan Dylan. Because he throws hot fire!”
Hahaha sorry man I should have had a /s on that. Since I feel like it gets discussed a million times everytime we play. 😂
What if you bit your tongue as he enters you?
My kid bit the fuck out of his tounge when he was 7 fucking around on the jungle gym. Like full extension and full through thought he'd chopped it off. Had wicked dents in it for a few weeks though.
So it wasn't actually the tightest you've seen?
Those MOFO?!
ROFL no problem at all. It was also everywhere the other day when people were saying the 9ers might join the convo
This looks like something the degenerates at r/baseball would say
Imagine Rashan Gary's shoulder crashing upwards into that chin. That tongue is coming off clean.
It’s the tightest spiral I’ve seen Lance throw, like what I said originally
Hey I resemble that remark!
Or something a cowboys fan would do.
I find it funny how much shit you're getting for such a simple comment about a spiral
We're the only mfs brave enough to be gay and proud in Texas
I don’t always get reddit, but this has been amusing
those were some legit elite passes.  Bullets.
The Baltimore-New England playoff games from those days are  my favorite ever. That and New England-Seattle SB49.
Pitta and Flacco with the porn mustaches were amazing together
Fun fact: the first time the Pats had ever lost at home when leading at half under Brady-BB.
Dennis Pitta was so good in college, liked him a lot in that draft. Hip injury derailed his career if I'm remembering correctly
I'm a simple man, I see Flacco I upvote.
2012 will forever be known as the year of the collars
I still remember when there were crazy-ass stats about this game; something like 'Bradys Pats are 100-1 when leading at halftime at home. The 1 was Elite Dragon Falco from 2012'
2012 Playoff Flacco on his way to 11 TDs, 0 Ints, 117 rating, a ring, and superbowl MVP.
Ravens played those prime patriots very well
[We stan another gentleman in this as well](https://imgur.com/a/IQyd8Uf)
The 2010 and 2012 teams were the two best teams of the entire era aside from 04/07. I was so disappointed when they ended up being basically no shows in the playoffs.  The 2012 team lost 4 games by a combined 11 points (and tbh, 3 of them had some pretty lousy officiating). They were world beaters then get to the divisional, lose Gronk, and just go quietly in the night in the CG.
Would that hit be called for a defenseless receiver these days? Mayo even fell on top of him, maybe not full body weight, but that kind of hit doesn't seem like it would go un-penalized today
Great football, big hit, shake it off n score TD, font see it much any more!
One of the best playoff run performances by a QB ever
The impressive part is how he held onto that ball during that hit.
Oh man I forgot about Pitta, that dude was awesome
what a hit and way to shake it off and get that tuddy. Man crazy to think Mayo might be this teams next coach.
Were the Ravens the only team to actually beat the Patriots in foxboro for the AFCCG? Considering the Brady and Belichick era, they might have been the only ones to do it.
Before that SB title, there were plenty of games where Flacco looked really good. Since the title, it felt like he just couldn’t muster up the same idk-what.
In 2023 the independent neurologist would have taken him out of the game after that for at least a play while they evaluate him and he never would’ve scored.
Seeing Dennis Pitta get hit scares me, man 😥
Nice hit coach
I Pitta the fool
The 2012 playoffs in 2013.  I get why it is that way but I always get confused.
Dennis Pitta is a name I haven't heard in a while
Joe getting paid after this Superbowl run is why the Ravens will never pay top dollar for a QB.
Old new school Patriots cursive not my favorite.
“That’s a good clean hit, Jim.”  Would absolutely be a penalty today, though you can tell it’s clean on replay.
Still salty that broncos weren’t the ones playing here. I will always hate that play by rahim moore
Outside of 2014, he’s been cheeks ever since this playoff run
Bro why did I Mandela effect myself into thinking Flacco was 7. Was so confused for a sec
Bring him back
Wish denver had THAT Flacco
Wows and yikes!!
Anyone else miss Phil Simms 😭
"What if our uniforms looked like they had polo shirt collars?"
I was at that game it was so cold!!!! So cold that my friend a brown's fan was wearing my extra steelers gear lol. If that was todays football Troy and 5 other players wouldn't be able to finish the game because of concussion protocol.
Playoff Flacco truly is a dragon 🐉
The second was good, the first was very ordinary. It’s probably the throw you’d expect every QB in the league to make.
Some crazy games.  Ravens won one where Flacco was 4/10 for 34 yards, 0 tds and 1 int.
I concur
Baltimore went so damn hard in the playoffs, still remember the Pollard hit that legit knocked out Ridley causing a fumble.
2014 divisional playoff between the two teams, for my money, is the best non-super bowl playoff game of all time.
Was in 2012.  Good lord.  That's one fucking hell of a stat.
Got shut out after halftime!
Seriously? That’s bonkers. Is that just Playoffs or the regular season and Playoffs?
It’s crazy that his career totals are a little over just 2k yards and only 13 TDs because when he was healthy he was really good
Oh my god, I'm reading that he dislocated his hip THREE TIMES. Poor guy
yup had to have multiple hip surgeries just never the same  dude was clutch af for us
Bring back the Pitta Pit!
The first time he hurt it was in pre-season practice, I think I remember they said it was a rare but severe injury that typically only occurs in car accidents when the front of the car pushed into the leg and then the hip so he was done for the year. After he came back but it was never the same and he reinjured it (less severely) two more times before retiring.
A stat line worthy of a massive QB contract
One of our more underrated rivalries
Probably, because it *looks* violent/leading and helmet to helmet in real time, even though it wasn't
The way his head snapped, you would expect it to be called nowadays.
Yea there’s multiple refs throwing flags on that hit today lol
Maybe?  He lead with the shoulder.  It was a real hospital pass though, Pitta holding on to the ball was pretty impressive.
By definition as it stands today, it's still a clean hit. But yeah they'd still flag it, no question especially since it was high near the head.  But goddamn that was a vicious hit from Mayo and still clean. Really impressive, I forgot what it was like to watch him.
On a tight end I could see them not calling it
Ppl on Reddit today woulda been calling for Mayo to be suspended n calling him a piece of shit lol
AFCCGs under Brady/Bellichick:  • 2001: @ PIT, win  • 2003: vs. IND, win  • 2004: @ PIT, win  • 2006: @ IND, loss  • 2007: vs. SD, win  • 2011: vs. BAL, win  • 2012: vs. BAL, loss  • 2013: @ DEN, loss  • 2014: vs. IND, win  • 2015: @ DEN, loss  • 2016: vs. PIT, win  • 2017: vs. JAX, win  • 2018: @ KC, win  So yeah, the 2012 Ravens were the *only* team to beat Brady/Bellichick at Foxboro in the AFCCG.
Uh his best season was in 2014. And even in the playoffs that year he played extremely well against the Pats in the divisional but our defense choked a 14 pt lead twice. And then he got injured in 2015 and his career went downhill since.
He used up all that power
The biggest crime of his career is that he didn't overlap with John Madden's time in the booth. "Dennis Pitta" is a name designed in a lab to be the only clearly understandable words in a string of excited John Madden babbling
" besides everything before the Superbowl and the last time he did it, he was bad "
The dude never blinked in the big games.
True, but I mean, Pitta was wide open in the end zone there.
It feels like he dropped off pretty quick or am I smoking too much ?
[Zach Wilson reading this ](https://media.tenor.com/rgegj1AOR1IAAAAC/awkward-black.gif)
meanwhile Ray Rice had like 300 yards that game.
Those are Army/Navy type numbers. Crazy thing is that game was a blowout our way lol
Ray rice demoralized the entire NE franchise that day on the first play from scrimmage.
That's one of 2 NFL games I would have liked to have attended. The other was SF-SEA 2013 NFC title game. As much as I love the NFL, I never have much interest in watching live. 2014 Bal-NE is peak Belichick/Brady.
That pollard hit was brutal
Regular season and playoffs. If BB and Brady got a lead, they generally kept it.
Wow. That actually blows my mind. I would have guessed double that.
If he stays healthy he has 8k yards and 50 td's at his retirement. Flacco Loved him, and he was great
6 years/120M$. 11 years later, that's peanuts for a starting QB.
Underrated?!?! They were the clear rival after colts/steelers in the 2000's. From very late 2000's and on the the ravens were the patriots rival and always played them tough (and came out on top a handful of times).
> One of our more underrated rivalries  No, it was not underrated. Not even a little.  Ravens were absolutely our #1 rivalry.
Depends on how loosely the refs in question define the "neck area" part of head and neck area.
And Almost did it in back to back years. Fuck you Cundiff.
Might have been exaggerating a bit by calling him cheeks but he was not good, he was mid at best.   I remember during the late 2010’s u guys constantly preformed mental gymnastics to try and prove Flacco was still that guy. There’s a reason u guys drafted Lamar. 2018 was gonna be more of the same till u guys benched Flacco and ended up making playoffs
Even in regular season games. One of my favorite Flacco memories is SNF in 2011 at Pittsburgh, where he drove down the field with like 90 seconds on the clock and hit Torrey Smith for the go ahead touchdown with ~20 seconds to go.
He had his problems, but man was he a clutch player.
I think the QB position got a lot deeper and better during the latter half of his career and he kind of looked worse by comparison, probably some drop off too as well.  But he very well could have been the best QB on the Jets roster last year.
Can’t get intercepted if passes are nowhere near the target or defense. Completion percentage is for nerds.
I think one of the crazier parts was our secondary was absolute dog shit yet Flacco had those numbers. Ray Rice really beat us down
He was such a good TE.
It's funny to think how much that contract hurt the team (how many players we ended up losing to pay him) and how that's literally what WRs make now.
That's the thing, people usually talk about the Colts or the Steelers but we typically could handle those guys. The Ravens actually scared us since 2010 (mostly me) and still do. Amazingly, we're still 11-5 against them all-time.
I will always feel sorry for poor Billy 😞
Yea in 2015 we had no talent and some of the worst OCs in the league. Not all on flacco
This is, in fact, one of my favorite memories too (but not b/c of Flacco). Even though we lost, I got to go the the game with my mom last minute when 2 guys my dad worked with gave up their tickets and he let us go. It was a blast hanging with my mom that whole Sunday night. Win lose or draw she's the biggest Steelers fan I know and the reason I root so hard for my team.
He was an average starter. Best way to describe flacco
Almost like he had you locked in an elevator and you had nowhere to go...
It was more like the draft picks didn't work out and the org didn't draft offensive players to support Flacco following the Superbowl. They hyper focused on the defense and gave the offense very little.
I loved those days, because we knew that we were the only team in the league that Pats fans feared. It was never a sure win and some of those games were absolutely epic battles, but in the era where the Pats were as close to untouchable as a team could be, it was nice being the one team that made Pats fans nervous.
Folks mostly talked about Colts/Steelers because that was the start and honestly that is where most of the hatred was! Ravens were respected probably for being consistently tough and it came later on (not denying that hatred existed.... That field goal missed btw on MNF, fucking bullshit!! Haha).
2015 was the injury year but what about 2013, 2016, 2017, and 2018? It’s not like Lamar has weapons aside from Andrews and y’all been screaming “Fire Roman” yet Lamar’s been a top QB in the league even after his MVP season
No infact lamar hasn't been a top qb stat wise. He's been inconsistent or missing. It's just that the highs are so astronomically high that it makes you look at him as much better than he actually is currently because you think he's doing this every week when in actuality it's one or two incredible plays mixed in with average qb play but it's almost always enough to win and I like watching my favorite team win.
> \#Colts QB
The script has leaked.
Tall white "football guy" with a cannon arm screams Colts QB.
Why would they need to work out his privates
Outstanding 4D chess move by Jim Irsay to confuse and render the 3 picks ahead of the Colts completely paralyzed in the draft.
With colts QB Will Levis?    Glad they know who they are drafting already...
If we draft him and he’s good I’ll personally post me drinking a whole cup of coffee with mayo
Script moment
He seems like a colts QB not sure why but I could def see him landing there
"To woke out"  Confirmed. Colts are woke outing Levis. What is involved with this anyway? Some kind of exorcist seance with Gwenyth Paltrow's candles?
Not private anymore
I think it’s mostly the similarities with Kentucky’s jerseys, but Will Levis seems like he would fit perfectly with the Colts
I just want the Colts to 1) not pick a QB, 2) get a top 3 pick for next year so I can watch Irsay take Bo Nix over Caleb Williams and laugh my ass off
Please do it. This dude is Trubisky 2.0
So he’s already the Colts QB???
Will Levis gets too much hate on here. Don't think he's that far back of Stroud
As Irsay says, he don't believe in guaranteed contracts. Dude doesn't even need a contract to claim a QB.
I almost 95% confident that this the guy gonna be a colt.
My gut says that despite the hype, Young's size scares a lot of GMs. I think the Colts will have a choice between him and Levis.
Listen, I’ve been a Kentucky fan my entire life. I know Levis is one of the best QBs we’ve had. That being said, he’s not an NFL QB. Dude reminds me of Wentz post Clowney assassination
bullshit. Will never responded to my request for a private work out
BUST
Noooooo
Noooooooo. He is Wentz 2.0
Meh
kill me
He isn't going in the first round, lol
I really hope they have the sense to at least show him a picture of milk
Hey that’s our guy!
I can never get over how sexual “private workout” sounds
The future is now old man!
Lol please let this be real
Having a private workout with #Colts QB
Please no
Script leak yet again
[Not like this…Not like this…](https://youtu.be/QGc-iPc-9dE)
Will Levis is fucking YOLKED.  Which historically means he most likely does not play the QB position good.
For real though, Steichen with either AR or Levis isn't a bad deal.
Terrified of milk screams Indianapolis.
Or a John elway guy
Jeff George was ok
Rivers is probably a top 30 QB all time, but he looked like he punted the ball out of his hands with the Colts
It's not that they needed to, they just wanted to.
You just don’t fucking get it dude
How else do you find out whether a QB has the balls to play in the NFL?
To see how long he lasts. The NFL season is a marathon, not a sprint. Checking stamina is key.
Think Westminster, on the table, enjoy!
Let's just say Jim Irsay is *very thorough*
To see if they can overpower Gardner Minshew's
Make sure he’s not sterile
Will "Deshaun Watson" Levis
Script leaks outta control.
sigh\* he's a colt
Smh everything is going woke nowadays /s
Yo I just met Bo nix. His apartment is (apparently) right by my house. I saw him at the dog park. Good dude tho fr, his dog is a golden retriever.
And the entire Texans org is Manziel
Stroud isn't terrified of dairy though
So you’re saying Houston will take Richardson?
By "alot of GMs" is your gut referring to Scott Fitterer and Nick Caserio?
He was certainly hampered by our scheme this past season, but it was kinda wild how he never really got any better at anything. He hangs on to the ball wayyyyyy too long, and he never showed up in the big games when we needed him most. He's definitely not a plug-and-play rookie, although it might still be a bit silly to completely write him off before he's even drafted.
Well, that means he'll get your team a #1 seed on the way to Nick Foles coming in and winning the Super Bowl. Doesn't matter if he sucks after that.
Wentz was going to be the MVP if he didn’t get hurt. He still finished 3rd in MVP voting with 13 games played while having an 11-2 record. This was as a 25 year old sophomore.  People forget how good Wentz was before he got hurt and things just spiralled from there.
Carson Wentz helped the team that drafted him to win a Superbowl
And Wentz was really good until injuries and being a headcase caught up to him
Do you make a new reddit account every single year when the Lions are inevitably **not** champs?
He's going top 5. I'll bet money on it.
No
Script writers really fucking this up.
I'm ok with it
Just accept it bud
Enjoy Levis
He's the next Josh Rosen.
Irsay dropped the ball on the coaching pick, but I am enjoying the rest of his season so far.
Step 1: The number 1 comment basically says this so let’s make pretty much the exact same comment and reap the karma    Step 2: ???     Step 3: Profit
You all will be drinking mayo coffee by 2024 and terrified of milk by 2025, but you'll be happy.
So Bryce is gonna be the best in the draft then ha
Have you seen pictures of prime Andrew Luck before? Dude was ripped
To be fair, QBs taken in the first round pan out about to be a franchise QB only about 25% of the time to begin with. Not exactly a high success rate.
It's yoked, not yolked. Nothing to do with eggs, everything to do with plows.
Mf said yolked
I want nothing to do with Levis
The problem is they could both use some time sitting, and gardner isint the best qb to have as your starter for more then 2 or so games lol
Let's see how he fits with our receivers.
Putting the thorough in thoroughbred colt
Seems like a pretty good reason to take him number 1
Nice. He seems like a good dude
You’re not wrong Walter, just an asshole.
Child please. We are the franchise equivalent of Blake fucking Bortles.   We looked like we might be good enough to get the job done for a minute and then showed everyone exactly who they already knew we were.  The Browns are obviously Manziel.
I think measureables matter to most GMs and draft choices year after year bear that out. Sure, there are exceptions. But most of the time, a guy with Young's physical attributes goes in a later round.  When a guy starts to slide, teams get nervous. If the Colts pass on him, he could go much later than anyone is currently projecting.
Whos the nick foles of 2024? Jacob Eason?
If your aunt had balls she'd be your uncle. He was with us at least 2 years after that. He should have been recovered from that.  Manning came back from a much more serious injury and won a Superbowl. Wenz  was thrown to the curb by 3 teams. Let's not make excuses.
That was Nick Foles. Do you not remember the shit show he was at Indy?
Personally think the headcase thing is overblown. I think injuries caught up with him and he doesn't take the easy plays.
No, just everytime your mother visits.
I bet he won't
Big xd
Until he turns out to be the next Josh Allen...
Irsay's first mistake was not firing Ballard, and everyone else in the AFCS should be ecstatic about that.
The top comment at time was #ColtsQB that had maybe 2 or 3 replies at the same time as soon as I made my comment and the others said nothing about a script or I just missed it. I'm am unoriginal bastard but couldnt care less about karma.
I miss Andrew
He was the best in college so that tracks
Every so often in my dreams brother
Not only that but he was jacked
1/4 is honestly higher than I’d expect, depends what pan out means though
What about QBs drafted 199th?
What if his primary source of protein is eggs? Would he be yoked on yolks?
Bone apple tea!
If only there was another mobile qb available who would excel with Steichen and is a proven mvp talent
>The problem is they could both use some time sitting  Or, I dunno, perhaps the coach works his scheme to ease an inexperienced QB into it, like he in some sense was able to do with Hurts.  Sitting, IMO, is overrated.  It seems to be a better game plan to give a QB a bunch of simple things to execute and ease him further and further into the playbook.  Let him learn who he is, and that it's not 100% on him to win the game.  If AR or Levis are who they draft, I fully expect to see games where they throw less than 30 times, with something like 10-15 throws being scripted short screens or slants.  Ease him into things, figure where he sits, and build on it.    Hell, Reich did it with Wentz in Indy at times and rode Taylor when he had to.  So get the QB some reps and don't worry about sitting a youngster.
Y’all really too low on Minshew.. dude is a serviceable bridge QB and could probably lead the Colts to a good 7 or 8 wins (with JT healthy of course too) next season.   Matt Ryan was honestly really ass last year
Gardner was a good starter for 1 1/2 seasons in Jacksonville so I’d say he’s fine as the bridge QB.
What about how it fits with your tight ends?
Browns moment
Nick Foles is currently on the Colts roster.
What you wanna put up?
We could use a good DE, I guess
Richardson could be the next Josh Allen. Levis is almost certainly the next Josh Rosen. Especially if he goes #4 overall.
You mean Josh Allen, lead singer of The Josh Allen Band?  I'm ok with that
I have no idea how Irsay called Ballard a winner and said to not do what the Rams did with a straight face.
Just messing with you friend lol. Hope you have a good weekend!
I know bud but he's in a better place now.
LMAO me too brother. In my dreams I can still see that Luck to TY bomb against KC...
He wore all the freshest clothes too
Agreed. Even so, which of the four (likely) in the first round will it be this year: Stroud, Young, Levis, or Richardson? Chances are three of those guys will either be a bust or top out as a journeyman quarterback.
Usually means gets a second contract from the team that drafted him in a lot of metrics
Starter worthy after 5 years still lmao
Also a 25% hit rate, lol.
Don't joke about yoked yolks.
Cam is willing to play behind Malik Willis.
Hey I'm all for lamar if thats who your referring to
Wentz?
The dude has a career 8-16 record.   He is a underwhelming backup with a weak arm, and plays way to conservative (his stats will look nice, but thats only becuase he takes 0 chances)
This subreddit has an absolute hate boner for Minshew.
Nah, Browns don’t like good dudes at QB
Yeah, but the Colts didn't draft him.
Levis might be mad about that, especially since he's already been named Colts QB
But Reddit loved Rosen before the draft and now they all hate Levis.
You gotta be careful not to win a Super Bowl, otherwise the fans might want another one.
Chilled with the hottest dudes
If I knew the answer I wouldn’t be on Reddit
Average out the number of Super Bowls they've won though and you have a much better average resume
They’re eaten by yokels.
100%
Dallas fans know cuz ya'll watched him terrified in the pocket christmas eve
> plays way to conservative (his stats will look nice, but thats only becuase he takes 0 chances)  I haven't watched any of his games post Jags so this is like the weirdest thing to read.
Well he gave his boner to some of their moms so of course they have a hate boner for him
Doesn't matter, he's Nick Foles and therefore fits the Nick Foles role better than any other player possibly could.
This is definitely true but I do think cause and effect have some amount to do with that. I feel like as people get older and younger fans grow up having access to all this film, data and being connected to news and players on teams that aren't their local market, we will see people be more scarred by past bad decisions of other franchises. Taking the 4th QB is always brutal. One reason I feel like a lot of fans hate Levis is all this talk of him going at #4 or 5 which is WAY too high. Rosen was drafted too high at 10 but it made sense for the Cards to jump up and try and get a QB they thought could work and they didn't really give up that much to do so.      Oddly enough, I feel like we are going to see the opposite effect of that same draft with Richardson. People want him to be the next Josh Allen and someone is going to give the Cardinals an absolute truckload of draft capital to make it happen. We will see if that ends up working out for them.
You probably still would- who would believe you? You’d have to start a blog an publicize it strongly, and then be 100% accurate over 4-5 years before people would see you. Reddit might be one of the first places you would start promoting it to be honest- it would take a lot of hard work and a little luck for you to make your way into a front office or on TV. Then you’d make it out the rnfl trenches
I know. But I'm not telling.
Except for Gardner Minshew. He can fit in anything better than most men.
Like Thanos collecting the last Infinity Stone.
Can’t be worse than Al-Quadin Muhammad was so I guess it’s a depth replacement at worst.
Lol people not realizing just how desperate we are for any help at all at almost every position
Word is he was better in Seattle, and ill-suited to the defense and position in Houston.  Seems like a good depth signing that might surprise on some plays if he returns to form.
Good luck with that. He wasn't the worst part of our defense, but he certainly wasn't the best. And it wasn't a great defense.
He always seemed like he had a lot of potential that just never materialized. Still remember the first pre season game his rookie year where he balled out. And then the post game local tv guys tried to interview him and didn’t realize he had a speech difficulty and it was incredibly awkward. Felt so bad for the kid, I’ve been rooting for him to kick ass ever since. Hope he turns things around for you all and manages a decent contract next year.
The missing piece of the puzzle
The traffic cones we had there last year need to be nervous about having a job now
Rasheem 'Mean' Green.
leagues fucked
The answer to the trenches the Bears were looking for
Yeah a lot of “the missing piece” jokes in here. Bears are literally building a professional d-line from scratch.
yeah he was pretty good for us. always looked like he had more potential than he demonstrated, just never quite took that next step
Texans defense was dogshit schematically, so I don't entirely blame personnel. If teams can generate wins with nobodies like the 49ers sometimes have to do when they're injured AF or like the Giants did for a season, it's worth considering how we judge players. I think he's really athletic. If he's in the right position, he can make plays. That's on the coaches. He's not some unstoppable force that makes plays no matter what, but we can't expect every player to be.
Is he better than Al-Quadin Muhammad? If the answer is no, I will be sad.   If the answer is "Who the fuck is that?", lucky you.
It’s a depth signing for the worst d in the league. Literally anyone is an upgrade at this point
does there?
>yeah he was pretty good for us.  Lol no he wasn't
From what I've been reading he's skilled at playing 4-3 DE, and that's about it. Not exactly an uncommon issue.  A horrible fit for the Texans, but could be a good rotational guy for the teams that do fit better. Fingers crossed on this end.
I hear the words you are saying, but aspiring to 2022 Texans level of defense is not something I thought I'd ever see.
So funny seeing this comment downvoted. He wasn’t horrible for us but was below average. I had high hopes for him but he didn’t really do much besides that London game.
He had 3.5 sacks last season, which is more than any of our defensive linemen had and only half a sack less than the rookie safety that lead our team had.
He’s not gonna be a centerpiece of the defense, if I had to guess. He’s a rotational piece.
Honestly, "below average" is still an upgrade from our DLine last year.
That’s optimistic
"You are a successful college quarterback. Any ideas how we can fix this mess?"
He’s not making it past 2 fellas
“Hey how’s it going. You’re gonna be gone by the time we pick but I wanted to say hi”
Anyone else still say tha raaadehs like Boomer?
So the Bengals gonna interview Paris Johnson Jr?
I love Bryce and because I love him I hope he’s not drafted here
Why do teams waste their time doing this when they know they have no shot to get the player
He won’t be there
Idk the Raiders trading up for Bryce, only for him to  ACTUALLY be too small to be in the nfl, would be pretty fitting.
surely this draft will go well for them, right?
I wonder how much the cardinals would get for a trade if Bryce young made it past the first two.
I swear if Carolina takes anyone other than young…that franchise is done for (will Anderson I’ll allow…they still have dalton with experience and corral who is decent)
My guy just wanted a weekend in Vegas.
Why waste everyone's time. Won't get past 2 if we don't take him at 1
"Hey, can you help us get a deal at Julio Jones Mazda?"
"How does being the next Derek Carr sound?"
They could sacrifice a small child and trade up
That report earlier this week about how HOU might not take a QB was a real big eye roll. Anyone who thinks QBs aren't going 1,2 and 3 is crazy. That said, I think OAK flying him out just in case isn't necessarily a bad thing. They have already been in talks with Arizona to trade up so they could be curious to pull the trigger should it happen. Also I think it could be a reason for them to lock in the trade knowing that if either Richardson or Young make it to 3, they'll be happy.
"Wanna toss a few balls then hit the slots?"

Chiefs interviewing Will Anderson too
Just in case there's another gas mask style incident would be my guess.
Actually heard a really interesting point from Robert Mays on a recent pod about this. Teams will interview players out of their reach all of the time for the potential of getting them down the road, if they don’t trade up. Whether they get end up getting traded or don’t find instant success, teams like knowing what guys can potentially fit into their culture and structure if the opportunity presents itself to acquire them.  I never ever thought about that before, but when I heard it, it makes a ton of sense to me.
Him falling to 3 isn’t out of the realm of possibility, however unlikely. You have to know for certain which of the top three you’d be willing to move up for and what price you’re willing to pay.
They could be looking to trade up to get him.
What if they want to trade up? What if they end up playing him this year? Al Davis used to meet with players he knew he wasn't drafting for that exact reason.
If no one goes to their birthday parties
I see no harm in interviewing a top qb and getting to know them even if we arent getting them
imagine them sweating bullets if Jalen Carter is still on the board.
Idk why your getting downvotes, funny af
No, but eventually it will.
You think young is better than Stroud?
I think they would have to sacrifice a whole town for that pick
>sacrifice a small child  ok but you can't do that to Bryce Young
But I kind of LIKE Mark Davis.
I don’t think a QB is going at 3 but 1 and 2 are a lock
>OAK
It wasn’t a report, it was Zeirlein literally making shit up to cover all “contingencies” as he called it
Durreck Carr lol
That’s what Terry Fontenot said when he was first hired by the Falcons. Made me start to believe we got a good one.
Sir, this is Reddit. Get out of here with sensible takes.
it's my flair
Young is a lot more nfl ready in my eyes. It’s really opinionated with alot of bias…I’m a San Diego state fan so I have no ties with any of these players.
Someone is going to. Cards getting a haul for #3 and if HOU doesn't take a QB for some reason.. I can't even imagine how much it'll take.
In this economy??
I vote Dallas
Man I love the draft this year. A half dozen teams who need a QB and two solid prospects.
Cards trading down to a qb needy team. It's essentially a lock at this point
Damn, I never remember
Gotcha, I saw the news reports relaying it and just rolled my eyes.
It wasn’t really funny- just a low effort comment. So you can out your little victim outfit back in the closet and wear it another time.
Bold move to trade up to #3 to avoid missing a guy targeted at #2.
Cards getting a haul for 3 isn’t a sure thing. Offers? Of course, but a haul? The drop off after 2nd seems agreed on to be huge this year.
Man I just don’t think so. AR and Levis aren’t either one worth trading up for
No, you do remember better times lol
Bold move to assume Josh McDaniels can count
They want Richardson but I think are playing it safe in case Houston snipes him. Gotta make sure they still like young
Nah, Richardson got teams to bite and believe. LV or Ten is gonna give up a small fortune to go get him.
What amazes me is that we both got downvoted with opposite views. What a negative place hahaha
People are all over the place for sure
Stop! You violated the law!  You demanded a review of the play, but we are *already* reviewing the play, you fool! Because of your foolishness, we will now *refuse to review the call at all* and you must live with the touchdown and your own idiocy!  It's funny how the rulebook can have these gigantic holes in it and the only way we ever find them is Lions games
Only had two arms and one leg down --- good call.  You need to get all four limbs flat on the ground for a tackle.
He didn’t make the law, he Justin Forsett.
Do that shit on Easter and I’ll be impressed.
The refs fucking the Lions, exhibit number 4,372.
I remember this happening like it was yesterday, watching the game with my family...  Can't believe it's been 10 years.
This was a stupid rule but if my memory is correct this was a few weeks after Schwartz yelled at Jim Harbaugh to “learn the F****** rules” during a game. Only the Lions.
You know it’s a Lions game when even the announcers have no idea what the refs are doing
Had the unfortunate luck of being at this game. Just brutal
I could've sworn this was Arian Fostet
Ahh Louis Delmas, after his rookie season I was convinced he was going to be Bob Sanders lite.  Guy just hit way too hard and didn’t last
[Beast Mode predicted it.](https://youtu.be/mUuZX829GxE)
Throwing a flag while a play is already under review causes glitches, they were just trying to save Schwartz from clipping into the turf.
>	Because of your foolishness, we will now refuse to review the call at all and you must live with the touchdown and your own idiocy!  “Then pay with your blood!”
To be fair, sometimes we find out about rulebook holes during Jets games too.
Hey, he don't make the law, he Justin Forsett.
It’s why we exist , to find all the flaws in the rule book so they don’t impact the Patriots and other teams.
Also see falcons vs lions 2017
It wasn't a hole though. It was intentionally made that way. It was supposed to prevent coaches from challegning automatically reviewed plays but after this debacle they scrapped that part of the rule.
Or in Nick Foles' case...
They should have to pin them flat for a five-count while the ref counts the time by slapping the turf.
Fun fact: That actually used to be pretty much how it worked a hundred years ago. I forget the terminology of the rule, but for a player to be tackled you had to stop them entirely. The ball carrier had to be brought to the ground and prevented from getting back up to end a play.
*The Sheriff*
Well there’s a chance someone will this year
I might make it a daily off-season post
Schwartz should’ve never challenged a scoring play
eh technically they just following the rules lol ur coach fucked up. the rules sucked tho and glad they got rid of them.
11 years actually🤓
It was more than a year after that  Schwartz said that to Harbaugh in week 6 of 2011. The play in the video was Thanksgiving of 2012
I was at the Rodgers hail mary game so I can relate to the pain
Jim Shorts clipped into the backrooms.
No. They scrapped it a few weeks later when the packers did this and they didn’t call a penalty.
What’s the benefit of keeping coaches from challenging an automatic review? Saving their back from bending over to grab it?
That's basically how it is in rugby. Once the ball-carrier is on the ground, they have one second to let go of the ball *or to get back up*. So you have to wrap them up and hold them down after the tackle; if you just knock them down or throw them down, they'll just bounce right back up and keep running.
There needs to be a grief counseling group for those of us who endured such pain
Gym Shorts was a big locker room guy
I think it was to protect the officiating from scrutiny if the gave a team’s challenge back if they were already going to review the play. If one team got their flag back but another didn’t because they weren’t going to review, fans would start throwing accusations of collusion/cheating to give a certain team preferential treatment. That’s the only logic I can think of. Still angers me to no end though.
Scar has been a contributor to all 11 Patriots teams that made a Super Bowl appearance, so a team Hall of Fame induction is certainly well earned!
This guy could make your average redditor into a serviceable Olineman. So well deserved
Well deserved recognition for a huge part of the Patriots Dynasty.
Fuck yeah I'd love to see that on video.
I love standing ovations, I'd love to be a part of one someday
I'd argue that he is the most important non-Belichick coach in franchise history.
Well deserved. One of the best oline coaches in NFL history to say the least. Hard to believe he coached in 11 SBs. Hell of a career
I hope Bob starts allowing more than one inductee a year.  Too many Pats Legends from the super bowls still not in.
If ever someone was deserving of such an accolade
One of the best oline coaches ever. Well deserved.
VERY well-deserved
Very, very much deserved.   I want to see him and Stoutland work together to create a literal immovable o-line.
Randy Moss mentioned Scar in his HOF speech;  > There is a coach by the name of Dante Scarnecchia. Dante, I want to thank you. One of the worst times in my career I received a letter from you telling me what you had learned from me and what an inspiration I was to you, a coach that uplifted me so much. You have no idea, because I was down and out. I wanted to leave the game. Scar, you talked me back into the game just with that letter, and I want to thank you for it.
He deserves it 100%
I have no love for the Patriots at all. Quite a bit of hatred and it’s been fun watching them suck. But I’ve heard of this guy and all he’s done for this team. Even I like this.
Man should be in the actual hall of fame. Has a good chunk of credit for those 6 rings
My dawg
LETS GO SCAR
And everyone clapped.
100% deserved. Maybe the most important non coordinator assistant in the last 30 years.
Bring him back!!!
Deserves it
Idk if he gets credit outside New England but that dude was an absolutely critical piece to the decades of success, well deserved
Excellent!
The real answer to who was more important Bill or Tom?
Everybody likes this.
With all the trash, cringe videos posted this would've been one id be happy to watch. Love reactions to massive surprises like this.
He deserves it
That entire paragraph headline and I have no idea what Scarnecchia did or does
Well yeah he's the reason for the dynasty
Makes total sense. He should be in the big hall.
Scar is first ballot Pats HOF, quite possibly the best position coach in the team’s history, maybe one of the best o-line coaches in history though idk enough to say that for sure
11 Super Bowl appearances lmfao fuck you guys
Was he involved with the 2014 team that beat the Seahawks?
They call it the S.C.A.R. system  Sign with Patriots  Cultivate mass  Amass superior lineman skills  Reap benefits of Super Bowls
I bet Scarr could've made me Russ Hochstein good
Second most important coach for those titles, aside from the obvious.

Is there a minimum person requirement? I feel like you could take care of this in the next few minutes.
-Michael Scott  -u/MattyT7
I am a huge Woody Allen fan. Although I've only seen "Antz." But I'll tell you something, what I respect about that man is that when he was going through all of that stuff that came out in the press, about how "Antz" was just a ripoff of "A Bug's Life," he stayed true to his films. Or at least the film that I saw, which, again, was "Antz." Thing is, I thought "A Bug's Life" was better, much better than "Antz." Point is, don't listen to your critics. Listen to your fans.
Do you also love inside jokes?
Ernie Adams says no
Oline is such a weird position organizationally, it gets money cus everyone knows it’s important, but sometimes almost isn’t highlighted in massive plays where they set up and allowed plays to develop for qb magic to happen. All while the people behind the line machines may have the most difficult coaching job.    Line technique has so many small technical factors from hand work, footwork, spacing, timing, weight distribution, focus and attention. All while being the literal heavy weight on the field operatingwith 4 other guys, as a cohesive single unit in one of the single most physically demanding positions for every offensive snap possible.    My dad coached it here in canada under different rule sets but listening to how he did everything changed the way i watched and played football when i was like 13. And 23 years later it still applies.
That would be totally and completely reasonable to do one a year for most franchises. Honestly, that might even be overkill for a meaningful number of them. But when you've had this level of sustained success for so long, it just feels cruel to see certain folks on the outside.
Vrabel, James White, McCourty, Hightower, Slater, David Andrews, Jules, Gronk, Chung, Gostkowski, oh and Brady… all due to make it in at some point.
“The”
Don't care we had both for 20 years
Real question is how Dante won 6 superbowls in the last 23 years
After watching what our line turned into the year he retired, and then watching it completely come back to form upon his return, it’s safe to say this guy was an o-line coach savant.
I’m a packer fan and literally only know one o-line coach, and it’s him. A patriots fan friend of mine was always talking about how instrumental this guy was.
I'm not sure how high Scar is on the all-time list, but I think calling him the best OL coach of at least the last 25 years is pretty darn defensible - which puts him in the Tasker/Hekker[1]/Slater "first-ballot Hall of Famer relative to position who won't get into the actual Hall because that position is not valuable enough" pool (see also Hester if he doesn't get in, likewise Cordarelle Patterson as a KR).  [1] - nonzero change I'm getting the name of the man who was at worst the best punter since Ray Guy mixed up with someone else.
Look, I know how this guy is. Probably a lot of people who pay attention to position coaches know who he is. I think he's easily one of the best o line coaches of all time.
Admittedly don’t know enough pre-90’s o-line coaches but he has to be the best out of the last 30 years. Those pats olines would revamp, have mid players look really solid but only under him, and seemed to help with gronk becoming one of the best blocking TEs of all time
No.
Better than the P.A.T.R.I.C.I.A. system:  Play college football  Assault and rape a woman  Tag along with a legendary coach  Ride the GOAT QB to multiple rings  Implode when given an HC job  Crawl back to your old boss  Implode again as an OC  Attempt to get any other job and fail
The the MAC system  Maybe might be Good   Assbackwards coaching approach   Compete for a Playoff Spot
Good ol Romeo Crennel
Absolutely. Scar was an absolute legend. Best OL coach I've ever seen and it's not even close.
That’s awesome.   Unrelated side note. I can’t ever get the fact outta my head that that the dude giving the nom went to a cheap rub n tug.    Kraft is really one of us, just mad rich.
Maybe I'm a bit left field here but you can sort of tell he doesn't really care about the accolades or recognition, he just wanted to get the speech over and done with and get back to work.
*starts slowly clapping*
Operative word being "coach". Adams was instrumental in all the success, but a coach he was not.
Ernie Adams says "I ain't no coach, lady, I'm a consultant."
Not a coach though.
It's better to keep to 1 a year, that way if they have a sustained run of being booty they have a backlog.
Vinatieri as well.
Mayo
Solid argument for some guys like Nink, Watson, and KVN too.
I was going to comment here, go look at that line getting absolutely bodied in the 2015 AFC Championship game without him, to the very next year putting up great blocking metrics, shows you all you need to know about this guy’s impact
he retired after the 2013 season, we won a super bowl without him the next season but you could argue it was his glue from the previous years that held it together  fell apart so much in 2015 he unretired lol
We could use some o line help
If other fans know who your O Line coach, he's either horrible, or amazing. There is no in-between
His story is pretty crazy. Parcells, Carroll, Belichick, one coaching staff after another came in here, fired the lot, and said, "Except you. You stay"
John Madden was an O line coach. Him and Tom Cable are the only others I know.
Him and ernie
Dude, he’s been with NE since 1982. Stop for a moment and think about how many coaches, shitty teams and coaching personal he survived but yet, he was hired back by every coach that was hired. Some of them HOF coaches like Carroll, Parcells and Belichick along with some crappy coaches like Rust, McPherson, Meyers and Berry but yet he stuck on with every team sans 2 years to the Dolts. That’s impressive by itself.  Also, he wasn’t just an oline coach either, he‘s been everything from special teams to assistant coach along with being temporary head coach when McPherson was ill. When BB took over in 2000, he was named Asst. Head Coach.
I think if Jeff Stoutland (Eagles) can keep up his pace, he could do it, too.
Howard Mudd is probably the only one that can go toe to toe with him over that time span.
This is one of the best things I've ever read. Thank you.
Whoa run that 2nd one by me again, he did what now?
Fuck i’d award this if i could
lol  DAMN
Well done
Dawg you fuckin win today. Bravo
I don't save a ton of reddit comments, but this one is straight into the saved list.
My guidebook has it a little different:  Pencil tucked on top of ear  Ass hair on face  "Tuck in your shirt"  "Respect the process"  Imitate Belichick when coaching the Lions  Call players out for things that are your fault  Identify as a rocket scientist when it suits you  Always make questionable choices

Rooney rule HoF placement
In Jupiter, Florida no less, there’s far nicer towns in Florida that he coulda had it in, why bumfuck Jupiter??
Damnit not yet....now we gotta start all over
What was that one spoof movie from the mid-2000s that had the running gag of the dude whose dream was to start a slow clap in public and kept starting it at the most inappropriate times? That's literally all I can think of lol.
It’s baffling that he’s not already inducted. My b.
> the 2015 AFC Championship game  Ugh, our fucking Center was tipping the play with his stupid head nods. Something a more competent OLine Coach would have noticed I think.
2014 wasn't the greatest line ever either.   2015 was injury bug, but also coaching for sure as Stork and coaching threw the AFC championship game.  2016-2018 is a golden period of o-line for the Patriots. Cannon locks down RT and the interior is Andrews, Thuney and Mason. Solder and Trent Brown have great years that get them paid.
2014 was very poor at the start, and only got by once they relied heavily by going Solder - Connolly - Stork (the rookie) - Wedell - Vollmer. Once Conolly and Stork were gone the next year, Stork got exposed and the rest of the line fell apart.  Cannon is a perfect example of the Scar effect. Absolutely fucking useless in 2014 and 2015 under DeGuglielmo, and a solid starter once Scar was back in 2016.
No, the line was a mess the first four games of 2014, then they shuffled things around and solidified it. Stork moved to center and did OK. They held up most of the season and came up huge in the Super Bowl. I forget who Dante’s replacement was, but I believe he’s had a career coaching elsewhere and has done alright.
Hugely instrumental.  I always wondered what they paid him because great o-linemen ain’t cheap, and he’s easily more valuable than an average one
Or he was caught on video doing cocaine that one time
Tom Cable
Eagles have been doing the same thing with Jeff Stoutland. Chip Kelly brought him in. He survived the Chip/Howie power struggle. He survived two coaching changes. I think he's now the highest paid position coach in the NFL and his wife is a significant part of the Eagles' charitable organization. A truly elite OL coach is the secret weapon behind most consistently successful franchises.
Oh yeah, and add Ivan Fears to that list too. He joined in 1991, same year as Scar I think. Another reason I don't think that dynasty will ever be matched or beaten again, the overall consistency the Patriots had at coaching was amazing. They've lost a lot of coaching talent recently and it shows.
[Honk honk!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnJn552ZcwE)
He was here pre-Parcells! Aside from a two-year stint with the Colts from 88-90, he's been associated with the team since 1982.
IIRC, Bill said he knew enough to coach any position on the team.
*Pink Stripes*
Yeah, that's fair.
Stoutland has been unbelievable and if he turns another group of 5 guys into the best offensive line and all pro bowlers/all pros, he is definitely in the conversation. But as of right now the only guy who deserves to be mentioned with Scar is Howard Mudd
[As a player at RPI, Matt Patricia and a teammate allegedly raped a 21 year old woman.  Patricia was indicted, but the case was ultimately dropped when the victim refused to testify, stating that she didn’t believe she could hold up to the pressures/spotlight of a trial.](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/sports/nfl/lions/2018/05/09/matt-patricia-indicted-sex-assault/34742627/)
That's precisely WHY he went there.   Less likely anyone there knows who he is (Didn't work out this time, whoops!).
*Starts clapping a little faster and louder*
[Not Another Teen Movie](https://youtu.be/0KpoqynjV1g?t=190)
My favorite part of all that is the time finally comes for the slow clap and he misses out on it
He played in 19 and the requirements is 4 years retired so I think this or next year is his first eligible
I couldn't believe it myself when I looked it up!
Dude our high school coaches even told our center to bob is head twice or three times every few shotgun snaps lol, the fact that an NFL coach is not imparting that knowledge to the players is crazy
DeGuglielmo was such a terrible OL coach. Just useless. And in the time since then he's been let go from 7 jobs, including by Boston College in just this past year.   He stinks, and he probably cost the Pats another SB appearance. Just infuriating.
I think he was injured in 2014.
Didn’t he retire, or try to, and they lured him back out with a pay increase?
Scar joined in 1982 (although he did have a two-year stint with the Colts from 88 to 90).
They had some amazing consistency in coaching for a long time.
Holy shit, how have I never heard this before? I sort of don't believe that all the "Fatt Patricia" Lions fans refrained from mentioning it out of the goodness of their hearts.  Was this not known til recently or something? Or am I somehow just super out of the loop?
Christ, just when I thought my opinion of him couldn't get any worse that just made it infinitely worse
I know not blindly believing any rape/sexual assault is a super unpopular mindset on reddit but I still think it's crazy to take this as an absolute truth. Nothing in that article really made it clear whether he is innocent or guilty tbh. No other witnesses, no evidence like rape kits (from what I've seen at least), and her refusing to testify make it hard to have an opinion on whether it happened or not.
*ejaculates for no apparent reason*
One of the funniest parts of any of those spoof movies to me.
Yeah, I assume that was what convinced him to come back
Retired for two years, our o-line went to complete shit, and his frustration watching Stork tip the snap count in the 2015 AFC Championship game, and a likely massive pay increase, brought him back for a few more years.
Yeah but I also think he didn’t know what to do with himself. Like, I’m pretty sure he spent his recent “retirement” flying to the combine and scouting players for the Patriots.
It was a huge story when he was hired as head coach, but then everyone just decided to ignore it.
It had been lightly covered before but I remember it blew up like the day after the Lions hired him as their HC.   Then there was just so much shit about how unlikeable and a dick he was in Detroit people just used that to talk about why he should be fired instead of referencing the rape.
It’s literally brought up in he comments on almost every post about him.
I'm not sure because while it isn't mentioned enough it is still mentioned fairly often on here when discussions of Patricia arise
Clapping dammit not fapping!
Arguably the only one
But what about clopping tho
Bucs fans will be happy with him, especially at that price
He's a Bradley McDougal type player. He puts himself in the right spots which PFF loves, but isn't going to blow you away with ball skills or impact plays. He would be safety #4 on our depth chart, but is a decent starter and great depth, especially for the value.
Im so confused PFF had his scores so high, so logically youd think oh, well PFF is doodoo, but i always see Hawks fans rooting him on. Is he good or just massively overrated and fans had rose colored glasses from PFF
Steal
Bananas that he was valued so little.  I think he’ll play a big role this year and will absolutely outplay that contract.
Overrated but the best safety we had.  Thank god we signed love to take over for Jamal week 1, and I hope he likes playing SS exclusively
That is so dirty cheap for a starting level veteran safety.
Pathetic that we've managed to price ourselves out of being able to keep a key player on a minimum contract.
152k? Jesus, that's a steal
So they swapped him for julian love who us giants fans largely regarded as very average
He already mossed that Brady reciever that only played two snaps and we never saw him catch a ball again.
Well McDougald went from Bucs to Hawks so this is only fair.
I wish he played more for us. He was a bright spot before being put on IR on that god awful team.
Our D was so miserable anyone who was halfway decent was treated like a rockstar.
Probably overrated by PFF, but a good player nonetheless.
Overrated but still a solid safety. If I had to rate him like pff I'd give him a 74. Doesn't excel in any one area but finds himself around the ball and plays fundamentally
Seattle looked markedly better with Neal on the field. Granted that defense was atrocious but he’s a decent player. I would say PFF did him some credit but Neal will be decent for the bucs
Ball hawk at times, really found himself in the right place more often than not. He also had some injury concerns. Guy balled out for us, but like others have been saying, you just had to be halfway decent to do so.
A little bit of column A, a little bit of column B  /s ^^I ^^think
He first came to light During Kam's contract disputes towards the end of his career. He played great filling in for him, so there was always a soft spot in our hearts. Couple that with the fact that he was filling in for Jamal Adams a lot, and you got your answer as to why we talk about him so much. Great dude, extremely high level backup, and your defense won't fall apart if you need to start him.  EDIT: Got him and McDougald confused. Neal is still fucking solid though.
He is a solid starter but not spectacular, and a no-drama workhorse type guy. Hawks fans root for him because having a solid starter as a backup is super helpful with all the injuries we've had at safety lately. And, he was never the reason our defense was sucking, which counts as a great job for a backup, imo. I wish we could have kept him. That said, he doesn't really make splash plays, and that's why he wasn't higher on our depth chart and didn't command a bigger paycheck
He's a good player, but a little undersized even for a safety.
You know he wasn't the best safety on the roster. You can make the argument based on availability with Jamal...   but Diggs? No. And I'd put money on Love being impressive for us going forward.
> priced out of minimum contract  sir
We simply didn't need him after signing Love.
That's a bonus (not sure if they mean signing bonus or incentive bonuses). The vet minimum salary for someone at Neal's level this year is $1.08 million, which is still a helluva deal.
(That was Tariq Woolen)
It helps that he was a udfa/practice squad guy. Fans love to love an overperforming underdog and love to hate an underperforming star. We happened to have one of each at the same position.  It was the perfect storm to have the more reactionary part of the fan base overrate him.  That isn't to say that he isn't a fine player, but this contract and the lack of interest from the rest of the league shows how teams rate him.
Didn’t PFF have him rated #1 overall at safety?  I know they did at some point.
62.1
You're combining McDougald and Neal
Think you have him confused, he came 2 years after Kam
I don't know if the numbers bear this out, but I thought Diggs was inconsistent at best last year. He would make an occasional play, and his performance in that last Rams game was stellar, but he often also looked lost, blew easy and/or important tackles, and just seemed not to have his head (or heart? or both?) in the game. I don't think it's productive to argue over something as amorphous as what makes the "best" safety on a team, but Neal certainly looked like the most consistent one on the field. At least to me.
Diggs was awful.  And I have no idea why we paid him when he is not apart of our rebuild going forward.  And yeah I like the love pick up, but wouldn’t you much rather have love being used everywhere instead of now being our starting SS week 1?
*Hopefully.*
Oops.
He's funny in interviews as well. Just a likable player & person
He was 4th in their final rankings I believe.
All Seahawks backup safeties are the same person to me I guess
Him and McDougald confused me lol.
This is why we come to Reddit for scouting reports.
I am not familiar with him, but PFF grading does not punish players for playing one-dimensional "easy" roles in a defense.  That's why Patrick Peterson was also so highly rated last year even though the Vikings secondary was absolute cheeks.  They just grade the plays that were there in the scheme the player performed in. Even if the scheme puts the defense as a whole at a disadvantage because it is covering for certain weaknesses of individual players.  That's why sometimes you get a defensive player with a high grade, especially in the secondary, who is not even remotely rated as high in the marketplace.
To be fair though McDougald and Neal are pretty similar players
I actually have an uncle named Jim Bob but adding cooter to the end of it is pure insanity
Jim Bob Cooter didn't change the offensive signals from the 2017 to the 2018 season so when we played the Jets the first game of the year they knew every play that was coming their way. Good times.
It is fated. Jim Bob Cooter and a QB that can throw that pigskin over dem mountains? He's a Colt.
Hopefully they kept the milk at Lucas Oil
he's got a great arm and he's mobile i know ppl want to meme him into being zach wilson 2.0 who the jets thought would be josh allen 2.0 but levis is built more solid, he was better scrambling and he played against actual defenses  worst things about him are his field vision and processing plus his age. seems crazy for indy to take him at 4 overall but trading back into the 1st round if he's still there in the low 20s wouldn't be horrible
Please do it. I think this dude is Trubisky 2.0
Jim Bob Cooter feels like a slur
Good to see Jim Bob cooter still working
Ass't gm Ed Dodds.  &#x200B;  I'm such a child
I hope the Panthers take Richardson at 1, the Colts do a weird, unnecessary panic and trade up to 2- just to take Levis, and then some random team (Minnesota, Rams, etc.) jumps up to 3 for Young, leaving Stroud to fall to 4 with Houston.   I want pointless chaos and talking head meltdowns.
They're really putting in a lot of effort to convince the Cardinals that they're not afraid of being jumped in the draft, aren't they? Gimme them picks and Will Anderson Colts.
He will probably be the only QB left at 4 so I imagine this is where he’s going.      And based on the tried and true method of “does Reddit/Twitter hate this highly touted prospect” I fully expect him to be a stud.
What all can they do and not do for a workout? Pads? No pads? Run plays from said teams playbook? Are there specific rules?
James Robert Cooter legally. He knew what he was doing
the fact he's 38 is mystifying
I used to know a guy named James Beau who went by Jimbo, so it was Jimbobo.
That's what happens when you put a man named Jim Bob Cooter in charge of strategy
The amount of hubris that goes into decisions like that are so insane to me. Like do you really think you can get away without changing a single sign?
That’s some Todd Downing shit right there.
Say it to me slower
I remember this game because I was in max security jail. It was kind of like dorms. Anyway, everyone was either a raiders fan or a 49ers fan but they all came together to laugh at Detroit that night.
They already have Minshew though.
He also has lower body mechanical issues causing accuracy problems.
Field vision and processing is pretty important. Guys who are athletic with a strong arm are a dime a dozen
Have we checked his Twitter history to confirm that he does indeed love to kiss titties?
Can you explain how he is similar to Trubisky as a prospect? Really the only similarity I see is that they both can run.
Based on?
Kentucky fan as well as (see flair) and I totally agree. He will lead the league in some sort of turnover per ____ stat and will do so by an outrageous margin
I am rooting so hard for someone to take Levis before Seattle picks.
Everybody loves them some Cooter
You do realize our divisional rivals, the Texans, who also need a QB, are at 2, right?
Dude. . . Spoilers!   You cannot just leak the script like that without a spoiler tag!
You think the cards will take AR?
I've been laughing at that name since he was at UT.
jr cooter would've been good too
You are making a bold assumption he is a James. I have a relative who's legal name is Jimmy. The south is on another level.
That's James Robert Vagina to you sir.
Yeah we all know what Jim Bob is short for lmao
Jymbeau
*strategery
You think my real name is Cooter Burger? What am I a cartoon dog?
Reminds me of the Bucs Raiders SB where the Raiders didn’t change any of their offense and Gruden played scout team QB for thre Bucs since he knew the decisions and reads already
>Say it to me slower  -Texans fans, every day of their lives
Will Levis is 23.
He also needs to be a Packers fan
Big, white skin, can run. That's pretty much the entirety of an r/nfl scout.
Both prototypical size, big arm, mobile QBs with great throwing mechanics who have pocket presence issues and decision making issues.  I don’t think the problems are fixable. It’s easier to teach mechanics than situational awareness and processing.
Yeah, but like I said I want unnecessary chaos that causes “experts” to lose it.   (Plus, division rivals have traded with each other a few times over the last few years- and who knows, maybe Texans have Hendon Hooker at the top of their board!)
They’re talking about trading the pick.
Some team is likely going to trade up for AR whose measurables are off the charts, and the Cardinals need so much talent they're better off with multiple picks for all their needs.
It wasn't even a hamburger... it was a sandwich.
ngl that was fucking funny
Fuckin got em lol
Ahhh I see, good for them. They have more holes than will Anderson can fill for sure
God I hope so. If AZ trades out of the top 5 to someone like LV, who's QB needy.. that'll easily push Anderson into #5 for Seattle. No way I see Pete and John passing on him with the defensive line being our biggest issue. I mean at this point, AZ is really the only team I'm worried may take Anderson.
So do I
The Titans are one of the teams rumored to move up to 3 as well. There’s somewhat of a connection there, as AZ’s new GM was our Director of Player Personnel for 3 years and was interim GM last year after Jon Robinson was fired.
That was Cowden who was the interim.
I think TN would be good too. I can see them chasing a QB as much as LV right now.
My mistake.
I got my eye on you J-Quelin
That’s awfully nice of the Cowboys to arrange that for the Saints.
I like the phrasing here.  Makes it sound like the first half of the sentence caused the second half.
Jay Quellin
That’s for the update. I was wondering where J-quelin at?
I read it like Jerry gave him permission
Roy saw how much salt Jerry was putting on his McGriddle and said *that's it, I'm out*.
Or that Roy is cheating on Jerry with the Saints & Garafolo broke the news about the "private workout"
Corey Peters
13 years means he beat the odds and gets a full pension. hope he saved his money. should be commended
I thought Jason Peters retired for a second but then I remembered that dinosaur has been playing for much longer than 13 years and won’t retire until his gambling debts are paid off
Thought this was Marcus peters
This mf has a yahoo Email address. You know he old as hell for the NFL
Why would you do this to me, OP?
There are too many Peters' in the NFL  (This is not Jason Peters)
I don’t know the name, but playing in the NFL for thirteen years is a hell of a lot of work. Enjoy the rest of your life, Mr. Peters! And all the cash.
Can’t believe he was still going. Still mad that the falcons let him walk after 2014
He made a big impact on our line for the run at the end of the year. Thanks Corey!
I thought Marcus peters announced his retirement for a second lol
Who?
Dude I just had a heart attack
Honestly, I’ve never heard of this guy.
is prayerful a word?
This tweet is intentionally misleading
Earned a cool $28.6M during his career. Good for him, and I hope he has fun never working again!
Bro wtf I thought  marcus Peter's retired 😭😭
He was great for the Cardinals. Thank you CP
Bye Marcus. Oh. Wait.
13 years is an amazing career
Your sure it wasn’t Adrian Peters oldest son
I guess god told him to hang them up. He works in mysterious ways.
I thoughtbit wad Adam Peter's lol
OP knew what he was doing
Thank you
Omg, couldn’t imagine if Cowboys legend Jason Peters retired
Aaron Rodgers
My first thought was, I have no idea how long AP has been playing, but I know it’s been a lot longer than 13 years…
How much pension do NFL players get? Any idea?
Is there any truth to the gambling debts, or is that just speculation from the fanbase?
I thought it was Marcus then I remembered he was only 29 or 30, then I thought it was Jason and I remembered he was 40. OP knew what they were doing.
I remember when Jason Peters was a tight end on the Bills. I'm getting really old.
A bears legend.  Up there with Orlando pace
I thought Jason
Same lol
I thought it was Peter Dinklage
Jason peters
Same and I was like since when does Marcus prayerfully consider shit
I definitely thought Marcus too, as a Chiefs fan since that’s the first name that comes to mind for me lol
I thought he quit mid game once lol
It was an intentional clickbait post by OP.
I use my Yahoo email when having to sign up for things I don't want to deal with.
49 year old here. I have a yahoo email address. I mean, are there really any other options?
As opposed to what? I’m 23 with a yahoo email
I have a Hotmail address that I've had for well, a very long time. Think I was in 8th grade when I made it. It is legit my first and last name. No numbers or anything.
I have my yahoo email I made in 1997
I still have an sbcglobal.net email address. Use it as my junk account but it's kinda cool that it exists
I want him back I was like wtf lol
Also not Marcus Peters
rip
It's a perfectly cromulent word.
You give me too much credit
Man. Fuck you.
*Buffalo Bills Legend
Razorback legend, lol. And my first thought too.
So… what do you think AP’s full name is?
At least 10
its in the 50s I think. not going to google it. but they have to get 8 years I think to be vested and they dont collect until  55. just googled it and its 550 for each credited season prior to the 93 season. supposedly \[I googled it} its 43k a year if you collect at 55 and increases significantly if they wait until 65. but since the life expectancy for nfl players is significantly less than the rest of society \[due to the damage done to them by the game\] I think its a crime to make them wait until 55 to collect. and you need at least 3 seasons to become vested. if they player creates an annuity they can begin collecting at 35 but they fund the annuity.   [https://awmcap.com/blog/nfl-retirement-plan](https://awmcap.com/blog/nfl-retirement-plan)  yes I googled it because I want to know. there also may be better answers
Like 40-45k
Our fanbase? Taking wild and untrustworthy rumors and sprinting with them on our way to run them out of town? Absolutely not, I could never imagine this fanbase speculating!!! /s
There have been multiple reports that he owes various teammates money and also that he has a gambling problem. Who knows how much of its true though. However, his net worth is now a lot lower than what it used to be and what it should be considering all the money he’s made. Those things coupled with the fact that he’s a HoF player who could’ve retired with dignity but continues to play as a backup for minimum contracts although his body can’t hold up kind of gives credence to the idea that he’s in debt, most likely cause of financial illiteracy. But again, nothing is confirmed, and the teams that he’s played for (Philly, Chicago, Dallas) all have media that likes to create drama or generate clicks.
It's absolutely incredible how [absolutely fucking massive this guy has always been](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovMY0IKGXmQ)  E: And yes that is THE Matt Jones throwing him the football
I thought it was J’Dinkalage Morgoone
Vontae Davis.
Thats what + addressing is for. Throw a [username+whatever@gmail.com](mailto:username+whatever@gmail.com) on and then create rules in your inbox to manage it. Works really well to see who is selling your data.
Yeah same with my old hotmail account from like 1998.
Aol, MSN, EarthLink, NetZero, Juno, SBC Global are all good current options.
45 and same here.  Made it in 1997
48 here and yep, got a yahoo email as well.
Gmail?
He think he old school 🤣
I’ve had a yahoo email since I was 12, had to make one to play fantasy football lol. I’m only 21
Would be awesome if you were 23 with an AOL email
I’ve had my Hotmail address for almost 25 years, it’s the first non-WebTV email I had and don’t see any reason to change it
Also not Peter Peterson or Petery McPeterface
Brady isn't immortal, Jason Peters is.
OP didn't know what he was doing*
Last season, I took comfort in the mental image of him showing up to work at Jerry World every day in his huge Eagles themed pickup truck
Don't blame him, Peters chose to come here
Bears legend
**Bears legend
Adrian Peters Son
Vikings legend Austin Peters?   Nicknamed Almost the entire Day?   Do you live under a rock?
Ha, I was high and read Peterson….
Which is more than 9
soooo did you google it?
The $550/mo was extended through the 2012 season. The 2020 CBA increased the amount per season, but I can't find the exact amounts.   For simplicity's sake, I'll pretend it's the same. At thirteen seasons, he is making $7,150/mo, or about $86K a year in pension.
Why is this the funniest comment I've ever read
I absolutely agree with everything and think what you said is most likely. But I don't believe using sources of his net worth is a good way to reinforce the rumors because the only way those sites would know is by guessing off those same rumors
Is that a separate account or an extension of the main account?
Adding a period also works for gmail. I use this because there are a good amount of sites that don’t accept a +.
I’m afraid to change though, because my Napster account is under this email. I need to keep it for now because I’m burning a bunch of Pixies live CDs.
My mom still uses her EarthLink email regularly. I have one that I haven’t really used since I was like 14 and discovered gmail  I logged in a couple years ago cuz I was trying to reset a really old password from a website and it’s still just as horribly designed as I remembered.
AOL?! That shit's still around? Wow man.
That’s better
I don’t know if chose is the right word. Dude has a mega gambling addiction and kinda can’t stop playing because of it.
Stop he’s been beaten enough
But less than 11, which personally I think is bullshit
9b?
he clearly bing-ed it
Lol
He was chat-gptold it
I’d also add that there have been a few Eagles OL who have said Peters was a mentor and taught them to be a pro, makes me think he can’t be *that bad* with his money.
its the main account, just a neat way of tracking incoming messages.  some sites wont accept the "+" because theyre not aware it's possible or they dont want you working around their spam.
Better hope that download finishes before your sister answers the phone.
Yep.  It's my dedicated spam email now.  Anytime a company wants me to sign up for something and I know I don't give a shit.  Here's emailaddress@aol.com.
I legitimately use an AOL email currently
Oh lol. I thought it had to be love of the game to play such a tough position at his age.
sauce?
Seven minute abs.  Not six, seven.  Sevens the key.
Fucking bullshit!
Ikr I still don't believe 10 is less than 11.
Being able to train and condition smart, take care of your body in a way that lets you maintain weight without sacrificing athleticism, and survive linemen meetings even when they're held by Jeff Stoutland are all important parts of being a pro but take an entirely different skillset than being able to invest and save your money.
That's quite a leap in logic
Interesting, thanks.  Gonna have to save this thread for the future.
I gave her my MCI phone card and told her to just use the payphone down the street by the Borders bookstore but she refuses
LoL that’s okay man, if it’s working for you, don’t change.
Damn fr? Like he’s broke?
Carlin?
Worth noting that O365, [Outlook.com](https://Outlook.com) and [Gmail.com](https://Gmail.com) support + addressing. Not sure about yahoo or any of the others.
She may have gone to Barnes and Noble because they have the Starbucks cafes there where I think you can get a thing called a mocha there...
That’s a rumor that I don’t really know if I believe lol.   Unsubstantiated as far as I know. People just can’t believe this old dude loves playing OL that much
Nah, something about Mary.  I may have mangled the quotes a bit
Gmail is my primary account, so that's what I was gonna try it on.
People can’t believe that he has trouble not doing what he’s been good at his whole life?  Not saying he does or doesn’t have a problem, but how can people not believe an UDFA turned 6x all pro wouldn’t want to retire?
Ah I knew it was something I enjoyed
Sevens the key.  Step into my office man… you’re fired!
> The Boston (later Washington) Redskins/Redsox are a few examples.  They also have history with the Boston Braves. The now-Commanders franchise played their first season as the Boston Braves, and the now-Atlanta Braves were playing in Boston at the time. The next year, the football team moved to Fenway Park, and changed their name.
 Brooklyn Dodgers Unis look great
I think its really cool that you do this!
Washington Braves would have worked as a name change.
This Packers-Jets trade feels like a frozen conflict like the Korean War. Things went hot before/during the start of free agency but they've since established a demilitarized zone.
BREAKING: JETS ACQUIRE FORMER GB QUARTERBACK
Zach Wilson 3rd string again?
Fuck Arod let’s just run it with Boyle
#LET TIM BOYLE
YOU CAN NEVER FOIL THE BOYLE BB LETS GO
Truly the worst QB I’ve ever seen start a regular season game in 20+ years of fandom.
TB12 is back on a roster
I'll never understand how a guy with a 1:13 TD to INT ratio at a G5 school ever got signed to an NFL team
It would be hilarious if the Jets do all of this (hiring Hackett as OC, bring in Boyle as QB2 or QB3, signing Allen Lazard) and somehow don't manage to get Rodgers
Tim Boyle might be the worst QB in the league. He must be a film room warrior because that's the ONLY thing he's good at and he keeps getting jobs.
They got their guy
Everything in this tweet makes sense, except for the QB's name.
Tim Boyles gotta have dirt on all of the NFL bc I do not know how this flaccid penis with arms continues to make rosters. I don’t know how he even made it to the NFL. He played at UConn for 3 years, passing for ONE SINGLE TD, and 13 interceptions. He then played at Eastern Kentucky where he amassed a staggering 11 TDs with, you guessed it, 13 interceptions.
LET TIM BOYLE  My man was a critical part of our late season tank. Have you ever seen the 2 headed dragon that is Tim Boyle and Nathan Peterman?
If Tim Boyle can keep getting NFL jobs than you can do whatever it is you do. Inspirational.
The QB move Jets fans were waiting for.
Was this part of Rodgers wish list too?
The New York Packers, brought to you by Aaron Rodgers.
I don’t understand teams that sign shitty players just “because they know the system”. Tim Boyle sucks even if he knows the system.
Tim Boyle - Zach Wilson.  Hopefully off-season only but the Jets have put together a strong case for the worst QB room in the history of the NFL.
So they just waiting for draft day to finalize the deal?
T I M B O Y L E L A S E R S H O W
How he hasn't fallen to the XFL is beyond me.
How this man is still conning his way onto rosters as a backup is truly astounding. He is so fucking bad it’s laughable.
Please go look at Tim Boyle’s college stats. Unreal finessing by this guy to even make the NFL, let alone still be in it
Who the fuck is Tim Boyle
They got their guy
Finally a vet journeyman QB my team hasn't tou-  (Looks at wikipedia)  ...shit...
I don't have anything against the Jets and want Rodgers gone, but man it would be so funny if he doesn't get traded to them.
The jets sure are going all in for an 8-8 season
So Wilson moves to #3 ?
This shit is so pathetic lol
Well, that was whelming…
This shit is just hilarious
Jets got their guy
The Jets got their guy. The division in shambles.
Maybe.
The funniest thing in history would be if after all this Rodgers doesn’t end up on the jets
Let’s GOOOOOOO!!!
Aaron Rodgers is washed so this is actually a competition
The Jets could’ve had Trevor Lawrence, now they’re signing washed Packers to kowtow to Rodgers. Hilarious timeline.
Calvin Johnson is the most talented and physically gifted receiver of all time. Jerry rice is the goat but cj81 woulda been if he stayed in the league past 30
Should be any day now 💪🎉
drafted 2018 is verteran…?
Rodgers is just way too much trouble for a year or two of service.
The Jets get their guy!!
So who's up next for the Jets to acquire for Aaron Rodgers wish list?
The Jets v Packers super bowl next February is gonna be so weird and crazy. In the home of Tae Adams too
How does someone like this even make a practice squad bruh
All this for Rodgers to stay with the Packers would be a very AR thing to do. Sorry Jets :(
BOYLING POINT.  &#x200B;  Also, on another note, why the fuck is this guy getting a job when there's probably at least 60 better QBs in the world
Honestly onboard with this just because he's a competent backup, which can't exactly be said of Wilson.
The Jets are just checking boxes on Aaron’s demand list. Nothing to see here.
FINALLY
Jets sign TB12
They got their guy!
The real TB12
My very first game I got to see a master class from him and Nathan Peterman. Glorious day when I got to see Tim Boyle come into the game just to throw two interceptions. Masterful tanking by Ryan Poles and Matt Eberflus.   Very thankful I got to see him play.
THEY GOT THEIR MAN!!!
Does this man have dirt on Goodell or what?
I’m waiting for the jets to say fuck it and give up. Just tank and try to grab of the qbs from next year draft. Aaron can’t be worth all this trouble
The Jets QB news we were waiting for.
What if I told you yesterday, that the Jets would be signing an ex- GB QB today?
Oh, Boyle Rules!
God dammit, I read the headline but I saw the picture of the Packers and I thought for a second the Packers had signed Boyle. I was so ready to flip that coin on them this season.
Look like he may be the starter this coming year
Hahahahaha good luck w him
ITS TIME TO BOYLE OVER BOYS.
I still sometimes have nightmares of when Boyle was starting for the Lions. NIGHTMARES I TELL YOU
  Alright, TIME TO WIN THE SNOOPY BOWL! LOOK OUT BIG BLUE!  Y'ALL GOT A BOYLE ON YOUR BACK!
A. A. Ron isn't going to sit there and tutor Wilson. He's got his own shit to worry about. This is the guy that will be attached to Wilson's hip.
The TB12 Era has started in New York.
Dude parlayed like 4 game starting stint at UConn into a 10 year NFL career.
Are they going to change the color green next?
Ahh the jets finally signed Aaron Rod…..what the hell is this? Who?
I did not have that on my Boyle Bingo card.
But what if Rodgers retires
Jets got their guy
Zach Wilson vs Tim Boyle for QB2 is the most hilarious competition I could ever imagine.
You got your day one starter boys!  Also I thought this was going to be a Tom Brady joke at first.
Gonna be so awkward when Rodgers gets traded to the Patriots
Jets got their guy
There it is, guys.  The QB news we've all been waiting for!
Crazy plot twist, 49ers trade for rodgers and give 1 1st round pick and trey lance. That leaves the jets the same way the broncos were left before the russ trade
That's my QB2!
Like, on purpose?
EKU Legend Tim Boyle
Jets becoming the new Vikings.. pickup old packers players
I would like this "trade" to be done already
JETS Country, Lets Fly!
EKU legend Tim Boyle
No trade for Rogers yet?
QB1
Tim Boyle sucks but I mean, he'll be better than that kid, Zach Wilson..
Looked up Tim Boyle… how tf did he find himself in the NFL with those college stats?
Jets got their guy
“Veteran”
Jets: now WE have the leverage
I’m going to laugh if GB ends up trading Rodgers to the Raiders.
Tim Boyle vs Baker Mayfield in 2021 to this day is the worst game of QB play i have ever seen
Rodgers to the Raiders confirmed.
This is it, this is the big get.
Jets are doing all this drama do they can eventually get Caleb Williams
This is perfect lmao that's absolutely the vibes on Twitter. The fanbases going after each other waiting for this damn trade to happen has been entertaining.
Maybe a dumb question  What is the Packers motivation to deal? Just trying to avoid a situation where Rodgers won't play?  I'm wondering how much leverage the Packers have to just jack up the price on the Jets  Dumb person dumb edit - why am I getting dogged for saying 'leverage'
We The North (Korea)
Nothing is going to happen until the draft i think. Maybe right before, maybe during, maybe right after. Neither side wants to show their hand now and give other teams time to prepare.
It's a proxy war between the pats and the lions
I can't help but think this trade was never going to happen and come late October all the Broncos fans will be comforting Jets fans about their not-Aaron Rodgers veteran QB that they convinced themselves would still be great but is shitting the bed and there's no hope of drafting a top QB because the Jets have away multiple 1st round picks for the washed veteran.
Because the Packers want picks they're not going to get.
I think Rodgers coming out publicly in support of going to the Jets made NY lose any leverage they had.
Packers are Best Korea, Jets are South Korea, Rodgers is the USA.  Packers are gonna start threatening to develop contracts of cap destruction to get the Jets and Rodgers to provide them with more draft picks as their roster starves (of talent!)
He missed on a solid headline.
I honestly don't understand how this wasn't plastered all over the place.
Heavy.com be like
Came here solely in the hope this is what the topic would have been.
He’s probably gonna be giving out concessions during games instead.
If he’s behind Tim Boyle he’s done forever. Boyle is so bad
Zach wilson is 2nd string.   Yall out here playing chess and Douglas is playing checkers. It was all a smoke screen Tim Boyle is our guy.
At least 2nd string as of now
Tim Boyle is much worse than Zach Wilson
God I hope so
probably too high for him tbh
Wouldn’t it kind of make sense if he’s included in the Rodgers deal?  Bring him in and have him backup Love and see if a change of scenery helps him
Tim Boyle is also not very good so it's gonna be a crazy battle.
He should be, he's awful.
Tim Boyle is worse than Zach Wilson
Let Tim Boyle
TB12 szn
Oh Boyle rules!
I mean, he sat behind ARod for three years and isn't even 30 years old yet. Why take on the old man when you can get the young stallion?
That'd be funny if Hackett was like "Yeah, I can convince the Packers QB to come here" during his interview for the OC position, and now he's like "I never said which one! No backsies!"
Go ahead and run with him.  His career rushing average is -0.2 yards per carry.
Starting to loom like ABs run with the bills
Not a bad idea to Collapse for Caleb.
No don't do it
My man you shouldn't even desire to see one quarter of running it with Boyle.
At this point. Just call the Cardinals and see about the 3rd pick.
Lol I don't recommend the strategy of going with Boyle... but what do I know?
You really really don't want that
Ugh… Rodgers is not Arod
I support this decision.
Oh boy, I'm gonna tell you to be careful what you ask for on this one.
Boyle Boys! Boyle Boys!
For the love of God, don't do that!
Not even Tim Boyle wants that
I think you're joking, but I think it's funny that I'm starting to see a lot of Jets fans already saying "fuck ARod" lol
It’s Boylin’ Time
Okay *that* one is funny and I shall giggle every time I see or hear it 🤣
They poached him!
Can I raise my Bortles too, just for old times sake?
I don't understand how he's still in the league
so you're telling me he's an improvement over Wilson
Worse than Nathan Peterman’s 5 pick half?
He's arguably one of the worst D1 QB's ever, let alone NFL.
Yeah but he supposedly great in the film room and as a teammate.  Plus Rodgers likes him.  Honestly it's kind of a no brainer signing.  Hey Aaron you want us to sign this guy on the cheap because you think he is big benefit to your game prep each week.  Rodger that!
And you have seen your fair share of bad QBs in Detroit including a guy who unknowingly ran 25 feet out of the back of the end zone to try to make a play.
You never watched Luke Falk then. Zach Wilson may be bad but he’ll never be Luke Falk bad.
TB12 is on the Jets!
I think he grinds his nose with rats into his gym pail.
is he really smart or something? teams might just keep him around as a player coach
Tim Boyle is genuinely the least talented QB I’ve seen in action and that includes Peterman and Ryan Lindley. I have absolutely no doubt that in terms of actual ability to play football that man is not NFL caliber
he's a charming white guy with a big arm
I mean he put up 11-13 TD:INT at Eastern Kentucky, not much better but still better
At this point I'm fine with the Packers getting less return just to make this chaos happen.  Draft picks are temporary, hilariously spiteful nonsense lasts forever
Rodgers is holding out to get Randall Cobb one last contract.
Jets become Great Value^TM Packers
The packers won't keep rodgers.   They are set on starting love, and they gain 15 million  in cap space if they trade rodgers after June 1st
Only on reddit is it funny to sign one of the best blocking WRs in the league and a third string QB who knows the new system.   I’ll admit Hackett is questionable because of last year but he still has a proven track record as an OC
Would definitely be on brand
Yeah, it’s hilarious when you bring in Hackett as bait for Rodgers.
He's supposedly a savant in the film room, and that's why Rodgers liked having him in Green Bay.  Dude has 'future coach' written all over him.
>  He must be a film room warrior because that's the ONLY thing he's good at and he keeps getting jobs.  That's how guys like Sean Mannion and Mark Sanchez stay(ed) in the league: absolute whizzes in the film room, so you bring them in as mentors/player-coaches.
In this case I could see it as a guy who has worked with Hackett before, can help install the offense, and be a camp arm.  You don't want him playing in games, but as an off season/practice squad dude he makes sense
He is not worse than Zach Wilson.
> Tim Boyle might be the worst QB in the league.   That's such an understatement.
Apparently he's REALLY good in the film room. It's all anyone talks about with him. Also he has a weird obsession with not losing yards on kneel downs and ends up trying to awkwardly move forward.
Nathan Peterman still gets work sooooo
I love this pun.
Hah!   What kind of jackass team just brings a bunch of players and staff from some other team?  Suck it, losers!
It makes practice very easy if the backup QB doesn’t need to take time to learn everything
It's from the school of "if Peyton Manning is hurt we're fucked, and we don't practice fucked."
I was going to ask about Mike White, but apparently he's on the Dolphins?
He would be terrible in the XFL.
will he not be part of the trade package anyway..?
I dont think he's quite at the Tony Banks level, but I'm willing to reconsider after the season.
As a neutral observer, both sides have just gone absolutely crazy with regards to this trade. It's wild.
I mean fair. I've been going after my packers friends. But they're owners. They should be getting things done.
I don't think it's entirely clear what the Packers' motivation is, but we've seen evidence that both parties have worn on each other significantly (Packers & Aaron). The Packers gave up a bit of *leverage* when they let Aaron shop around, he has a large cap hit on their books that can be alleviated a bit, and they're aware that Aaron is a single event away from retirement. That combination of considerations affects their *leverage*. However, the Jets aren't much better off in terms of *leverage*, as they're basically all-in on Aaron. It's technically possible that they pivot to a trade for someone like Tannehill or Stafford, or that they go nuts on a Lamar contract, or just tank with Wilson. I don't think either team has significant *leverage*, but both parties want to rip each other off.
Be careful with that word
The Packers’ motivation is that they may as well get whatever compensation they can for Rodgers, given that they aren’t championship contenders regardless and probably won’t be for the rest of Rodgers’ career.  Some people have construed this to mean that they have no leverage, but the Jets essentially have to operate under the assumption that they have a 3-4 year championship window because there’s no guarantee the recent draft success they’ve had will continue after rookie contracts start to expire.  If Rodgers has juice in the tank, he’s their best bet to take advantage of that window. Lamar is expensive with no guarantees he’ll stay healthy and the franchise has just whiffed on quarterbacks in the first round twice in a row.
Likes others said, its either you get nothing and Rodgers retires or you get something and he plays for the Jets.   The Jets are dealing on the thought that the Packers want something rather than nothing and the Packers are dealing on the thought that the Jets have a window with their team and the Packers are gonna be bad either way so the Jets need this to happen more.   as to your edit "Leverage" is a word that gets overused to the point that people hate it because people like to say one side has all the leverage or no leverage at all and its just overused hyperbole. ie the Jets have all the leverage or the Ravens have all the leverage so the other side should just blah blah blah.
To ease the cap hit, our window has closed and Gute needs to build around Love (sunk cost fallacy)  Plus it seems like Rodgers is tough to work with. Gute might like dealing with a 4 year guy instead of a 39 year old vet. Bet it gets exhausting
I'd think they hold all the leverage. They planned to have Rodgers all along until the jets were interested, if I were the Packers I'd be asking them if they really want to start Wilson and lose this year. It only helps that the jets fans are expecting Rodgers and were told they are getting him.
Would you rather have no quarterback with or without extra draft picks?  Aaron is almost certainly not playing another season in GB even if they don't trade him. GB has been in a low leverage situation this whole time because of that, but Lamar being an option seems to have heated up the QB trade conversation for teams other than NYJ (Indy and New England seem to be interested at a minimum). Remains to be seen what that does to Rodgers' value in a trade, but I doubt it'd decrease since there's more interested teams than available QBs.
Rodgers dead cap hit for trading him Pre June 1 is MUCH larger than his actual cap if the keep him this year. However if they wait til Post June 1 it's basically $0. This is what they're waiting on. It's not some grand conspiracy or stalemate between the teams.
Draft picks, cap space, and a better chance of keeping Love long term.
They would have to pay Rodgers like 60 million dollars and sit Love another year
Worst case, GB has Aaron Rodgers. Jets have Zach Wilson. Leverage
I read through all your replies and I can’t see where you’re getting dogged for saying leverage. Which comment are you referring to?
Cap space I think
Basically the Packers realised that they wont win with Rodgers. Its Not a knock on Rodgers, sometimes things Just dont work anymore. Add to that its rumoured that Rodgers lacked effort and motivation Last season and Packers ultimately got sick of his antics.   The Deal is structured to have 2023 as the only year with an  out, retirement or trade doesnt matter. Packers can get off rather easily in 2023, compared 2024 and 2025. In the worst Case scenario, the Jets Deal doesnt happen and Rodgers is being a dick about it and "comes back" to mess around, Packers can trade him anywhere they want. He doesnt have a no trade clause. But that move would damage their Image big time.   So Packers dont have much leverage, but at least they are flexible and have time to wait for a deal. The Jets dont have time and No leverage cuz they went publicly all in one Rodgers and other options arent on the table. The Jets have No QB and the market right now simply isnt there, except for Lamar who they guaranteedly cant afford.
No one seemed to mention the actual money aspect. Ok so first of all he is uncuttable due to the potential cap hit. If you wan't to get rid of his future cap implications, you need a trade.  If Rodgers is traded, he is a $40M dead cap hit on the Packers' books this season and after that zero. So they would take all of the hit now, in a year where they are transitioning and not a contender.  If he is still on the roster by week 1, they must exercise his $58M dollar option bonus, which means all that dead money will be hitting their books in 2024, when they should be trying to build a team around their new QB.
I think Kim Jong Un said something once about biting kneecaps.
i feel like not enough media messed around with Amari Rodgers being A. Rodgers "Packers cut A. Rodgers" etc
Hot Dogs for Milfs
'At Home With Zack Wilson'
Lol hell be starting week 1
Boyle is a locker room guy, not meant for any playing time. On you guys for playing him
Jets got their Packers QB.
I don't think that's possible
The only thing he has going for him is that he knows the system, I think a flyer on a young QB in the draft or a more experienced QB would yet similar or better results. He better be cheap contract.
He was better than Love in Jordan’s rookie year. Boyle was the number 2 all season, not Love. Clearly had regressed.
The true TB12
JETS about to hit the BOYLEING POINT
The best part of Tim Boyle was when he said 'IT'S BOYLIN' TIME' and boyled all over those guys
Boyle the jug
Boyle The Boiler!
Lettim Boyle!
A real KFBF
Tim’Boyle rules!
Jets about to Boyle over the whole AFCN
I, for one, am ready to watch that Boyle POP off!
Saleh wants him! From his chest pubes down to his ball ['fro!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeRfQs6_fC4)
after last year promising to bring a superbowl winning qb to denver
Shhhh let them believe
Yep. great QB room guy, trash on-field QB.
He had a 9-2 record in games he played for GB, that I’d a better winning percentage than Aaron Rodgers.
The best part of Super Bowl LVIII was when Tim Boyle said "It’s Boylin’ Time” and then Boyled all over the other team
212 crew
They whisked him!
He's a glorified QB coach
I would watch Zach Wilson an entire season rather than a single game of Boyle
Zach Wilson could play blindfolded with both arms tied behind his back, and still do a better job.
He's like 4x worse than Zach Wilson.
He’s not, and to be very clear, I’m no higher on Wilson than others here.
I dunno, NFL is ultimately an entertainment business and that was damn entertaining.
That is a close one, but yes. It admittedly took Boyle 3 games to throw 6 picks, but that was almost entirely with him throwing 3 yard check-downs. I would trust Nathan Peterman more for 10yard+ passes and to actually win a game if we need to do anything more than protect the lead.
Nah, as bad as Boyle is, there are quite a few D1 QBs below that level. That''s a big pool and it gets real dicey near the bottom of it. Boyle, as bad as he is, is superior mechanically, physically, and mentally as a QB to a lot of the guys starting at the bottom of the Group of 5 or throughout mid-tier FCS.  He's certainly one of the worst D1 QB prospects to get to the NFL in recent years, that's for sure.
(You may have misunderstood my comment—I was referring to Boyle not Wilson. Wilson has his problems but he at least has starter caliber physical talent).  I have seen Luke play and Tim Boyle makes him look like Patrick Mahomes by comparison.
This is me at the end of a relationship with a formerly hot and likable girl who has turned into a raving lunatic.  "Go be someone else's problem so I can watch and laugh."
as a Jets fan we dont even deserve Rodgers considering all the stupid shit JD is pulling. Hes playing stupid hardball. Its not the packers problem if Rogers retires after a year and the Jets are screwed. Thats the risk we should be willing to take to get one of the best qb's of all time.
I'm somehow picturing Pat McAfee and AJ Hawk camping outside Cobb's house with a burlap sack waiting for the green (19) light
When are they trading for Za'Darius Smith?
15million can be moved. They don’t get any extra total.
Better outcome: They don't trade Rodgers and still start Love.
If they stretch it to post June 1, you can bet they're only gonna get like 1 second rounder (or worse) back for him. At that point they'll have ruined their relationship with both him and the Jets and will need to wipe their hands as fast as possible to avoid real damage to their team. By that point Rodgers will be shit talking the Packers publicly as much as possible, Love will be in a bad situation, and other front offices won't want to do business with Green Bay seeing how they operate
when the only thing you can mention about a WR is his blocking lol.
>but he still has a proven track record as an OC   I wouldn't call 1 season of competency as a playcaller a "proven track record"  It's clear all of these moves are made with one goal in mind, which is why it'll be hilarious if they don't get Rodgers
> he still has a proven track record as an OC  lmao the cope is getting out of control here
3rd string QB is basically just the second QB coach on most teams
Or Rodgers liked having him there as a reminder to the organization of the kind of QB play they can expect in his absence.
Josh McCown too, although he was also a more competent player than those two.
Yes he absolutely is
Absurd take
Tim is absolutely worse than Wilson.  He’s just never been asked to be as good as him.
Zach Wilson helped beat the Packers 27-10…
Yeah gives them time to learn future opposing QB styles so they can mimic in practice, rather than spending that time learning your own offense and slowing practice down.  I definitely understand that "he knows the system" is a weak argument most of the time.
I doubt it.
Not sure why we'd want Wilson. We wouldn't be trading Rodgers if we didn't believe in Love. And by trading Rodgers we are already accelerating 8 mil in cap for 2023 and so taking on Wilson would add another 10 mil in cap space. Our combined QB cap hit would be over 54 million.  If we're taking a contract back from the Jets it's probably Corey Davis who while overpaid at least fits a position of extreme need.
Bears fans are not really neutral observers. They want the demon out of the division more than Jets fans.
I’m not a neutral observer and it’s entertaining the hell out of me.
This off-season has been a dream for the bears. Amazing trade and packers are imploding.
I'm at the point right now where I wouldn't mind the jets not getting Aaron and having the packers either eat that money or be forced to have Love throw 4 ints against the bears while Rodgers sits on the bench in plain clothes.
This is very well put, and likely the most concise summary of what’s going on I’ve seen.
They aren't tanking with that defense. They have a lot of young talent that can win now. They're getting a QB for sure
Did somebody say *leverage*?
Extremely accurate and well examined. I would like to add the crazy amount of ex Packer players recently signed to the Jets roster. It's an oversight in my opinion.
Jordan Love is due for his 5th year option soon. I think this is about figuring out what they have in Love in case he’s legit and then they’re on the franchise tag carousel
I think the Jets got more leverage. Worst case scenario for the Jets start Wilson and hope he plays well or pay Lamar a fully guaranteed contract. If the Packers don’t trade Rodgers they have to hope he retires or take his insane cap hit. Plus if he doesn’t retire there’s no way you start Jordan Love over him, who is due for an extension. So the Packers really have nothing to gain playing hardball.
Did somebody say…*leverage*?
“Say 'leverage' again. I dare you. I double dare you, motherfucker! Say 'leverage' one more goddamn time!”   - Samuel L Jackson if he was a Jets or Packers fan
If this trade falls through and Aaron retires even though he has 60 million dollars waiting for him if he plays, I’ll get a tattoo of whatever the hell Reddit wants.  Packers are trading him or paying him 60 million. Packers want him gone as much as Jets wants a QB.
Or better yet he doesn’t retire and shows up to camp.
It's so dumb that the Jets didn't have a backup plan at all for like Jimmy G or Derek Carr like they put all their eggs in one basket.
I wouldn't even say he is building around Love he just needs young talent because he needs guys who will be good after the cap problems.  Obviously you need to evaluate Love but its not like they have given him a second contract.
They don't hold all the leverage especially before the draft.  In turn as soon as the draft is done the Packers gain leverage everyday unless the Jets get Lamar.
I’m not sure that there are as many interested teams as people think. Rodgers is nearly done. He’s incredibly expensive in both cap hit and picks (if rumors are true).   Seems like weird time to start a new  I don’t think Packers have any leverage
This years cap hit wouldnt be that different if they trade him pre june.  Its 40m cap hit to trade him pre June, 30m to keep him this season (plus 45m dead), 15m this year and 25m next year if they trade him post June.  Also dont think theres a huge incentive to trade him post june 1 since the big free agency contracts are all signed.
Tbh I'm not even certain he's a good lover anymore
I think the Jets are hoping Zach learns out to be a QB on the field from Rodgers and QB off the field from Boyle.
Uhh ya that’s why I just said if he’s ahead of Zach it’s not good.
Nah bro we got the #2 pick due to him. Mans is a legend
He was all we had. It was like that 49ers playoff game. Boyle was the most qualified we had because he threw a ball in college.
Gotta love everyone in here trying to dunk on a 3rd stringer
Google Boyles college stats
The Jets are going with THAT MOFO.
A+ end of game kneeler though. Dude manages to not get negative yards on them like a true pro
Oh man I'm toasty, let's do the math!    Rodgers records per PFR: 147 - 75 (1 tie): 66%    Boyle's 81% > 66%   Jets have the leverage!
Scramble drill about to be lit
Why not just hire him as a QB coach then, instead of wasting a roster spot
Good news, I'm pretty sure he already does
These lions fans forget about Charlie Batch and Joey Harrington pretty quick lol. Absolutely ass cheeks in their prime.
And the year he played for Eastern Kentucky the team went 4-7 (though they played Kentucky fairly close 16-27)
There are two issues with that.  First, the Packers can realistically wait until right before the season starts to trade Rodgers.  This would cost the Jets their offseason program.  (Rodgers could show up to the Packers offseason program and make it painful to do this, but Packers having a headache isn't as bad as the Jets being realistically unable to run their entire off season on offense).  Second, it runs the risk of another team becoming interested and making an offer.  This obviously requires Rodgers being willing to go to another team so the pool of teams is limited but  2 teams reported as monitoring things/interested puts this as a possible risk.  Particularly when you consider that next year's picks are likely to be later in the round anyway for any team offering them if they have Rodgers so the Jets don't have the advantage of this year's picks being earlier.  All that being said, I haven't heard that particular rumor and I expect the deal to get done either on draft day or just before.
No, we don't know how much hardball JD is playing because despite all the stories and reports the media is trying to spin, we don't actually know what the Packers are demanding and what JD is offering.
This would be the best timeline from the outside looking in. Rodgers sulking on the bench and the '23 offseason champ Jets running it back with Wilson.
That would be the absolute worst case scenario from them. No draft picks, no reduction in salary cap and fans watching him sit behind Love knowing Love isn't good enough.
What relationship? Rodgers and GB are in straight up divorce court territory at this point
>At that point they'll have ruined their relationship with both him and the Jets  What relationship is there with the guy who has already come out publicly to say he doesn't want to play for the Packers? And as far as the Jets who cares, they're another organization and the Packers only goal should be to maximize returns.
Not sure how true that is. Who needs Rodgers more ? Jets are screwed if they don't get him.
They could trade him today, and designste it as a post June 1st trade.    I fully expect him to be traded before the draft
Lazard is a great blocker but it's very clear here that the ACTUAL draw with Lazard is his chemistry with Rodgers lmao
I mean I also could’ve mentioned how he had more receiving TDs than any Jets WR last year, and more catches and yards than anyone besides Garrett Wilson. I just chose to highlight his best skill to keep my comment short.
didn't he lead the league in third down conversions?
He's a solid WR 2.5/3, they didn't sign him to a top contract which is why no one is expecting 1k+ yards.
I can definitely see why a Broncos fan would think so.
He wasn't even the playcaller in Green Bay. His one playcalling stint was in Jacksonville and he was a disaster there
If SF fans could read they would be very upset with this comment
Spot on lol I can't remember if it was Boyle or Kizer but I remember Rodgers saying one of them would hover next to LaFleur on offense to make sure Matt didn't call a TO when it looked like Rodgers might run out of playclock.    ..... Oh shit THAT'S why they signed Boyle
Brian Hoyer has pretty much been a QB coach since like 2015
Yeah, I winced when Seattle signed Mannion, but he seems to be spending a lot of time with Lock and Geno and getting them ready for game day.
When have you seen Tim Boyle try to throw the ball away by throwing it inbounds like two feet and get intercepted?
Tim Boyle helped THREE teams beat the Lions.  Take that, Zach.
Ya I'm not sure why we'd want him. Plus from a fans' perspective if you are dealing Rodgers it's because you believe in Love. Why hedge with Wilson? Not even getting into the cap implications
Yes and no. Rodgers staying fucks them so bad cap wise and I'm not so sure he would even play for them. I want them to get no draft capital.   But I'm not neutral, that's fair. I'm just not an active participant.
Packers and bears fan… how the fuck did this abomination happen
You lose a bet with that flair or just enjoy chaos?
I'm definitely a neutral party and I think it's funny as hell!
I'm still waiting for them to pull a rabbit out of the hat and fuck us. I've been burned too many times.
I love the spite you bring to the table right now.
I’m adding nothing to this comment but I am agreeing and commenting to show how much I agree
I think they grab Lamar if they can’t get Rodgers.
What are their B and C options? With the NYJ roster I’d be surprised if this trade *didnt* happen, but also not that surprised since it hasn’t happened yet and that’s NY football.  Also the Packers are in total scramble mode but are acting like they hold the cards which is funny, I don’t mean they’re like “hey we hold the leverage” but it’s hilarious to be like “we’re ready to move on to Love” and then be difficult about it lol, classic Packers not getting ahead of the curve and having a full, successful off-season
*Battlefield Earth* intensifies
LEVERAGE?!
I got that reference!
Did you see the size of that hand cannon?
!Remind Me May 7 2023
Lamar for Rodgers straight up. Add in Love so we can take the mantle of most QB dramatic team since we've been trying to take that this off-season anyway (not serious)
It’s not like they encourage people to have sex in Provo, Utah.
Take it from me, he isnt. Although i did the taking i suppose.
Jets were originally going to get Jimmy G to teach him to be a QB in the sheets, but it turns out, that was Wilson's greatest strength, so there was no need to pursue him.
*Monkeys paw curls* Zach Wilson learns how to be a QB on the field from Boyle and QB off the field from Rodgers. This is the most Jets scenario and you know it.
“Learns out” is my new favorite trigger phrase for grammar nazis. Irregardless…
Oh god that game was over a year ago. Time flies
Who probably makes more than all of us combined
awful and yet a lateral move at worst
UConn legend! Heard many a boos rained upon him in college.
how  did he even get a workout? Like he started one season and played poorly
They already had A MOFO, this is a totally different MOFO.
That poor centers cheeks getting clapped.
I don't know. Hes truly an awful quarterback.
Why have 1 QB coach when you can have 2
Tim Boyle makes Charlie Batch look like prime Warren Moon
We don’t. I watched both of them. They’re better than Boyle.
I literally had a signed Charlie Batch flag above my bed growing up because he came to our local Meijer 😂  I am begging you to watch some Boyle “highlights”. There are FCS level college QBs out there right now with no pro possibility that have more arm strength and downfield accuracy.
Im biased, but I think the idea that the packers would wait until week 1 to trade him isn’t realistic. The Jets at that point would just wait for the packers to cut him and sign him for no trade comp. I think thats why the packers have said they want the deal done soon, but the jets have publicly stated they are fine waiting.  As long as Rodgers remains committed to wanting to play for the jets it becomes very risky for the packers the closer we get to week 1.  Thats obviously a massively important condition that could change, but I think thats why the jets have openly stated Rodgers is their only focus. Rodgers desire to play for the jets is the most critical bargaining chip.
If Rodgers who has skipped our offseason programs for years shows up THIS year just to make it awkward I think he'd lose a lot of goodwill with the fanbase. Literally inconveniencing himself to make a thing out of it.
true we don't know all the specifics. But it's most likely the Jets wanting protection in case he retired after a year.
That would suck immensely lol but I feel like if a trade doesn't go through, Rodgers just retires 🤔
That's just not how business works. These are multi-year relationships and it's a pretty small country club. If you sour a relationship and screw over another team over essentially one more mid-round draft pick, people do take note. Believe it or not reputation matters in such a small community
We’ve always sucked. Won’t be much different. People thing fans will turn on Jets brass if they don’t get Rodger, but most fans seem to believe in JD
This isn't accurate.  The post June 1 designation only applies to players being released.  It doesn't apply to trades.  The post June 1 cap impact only comes into effect if he is actually traded after June 1
wow what a high bar you set there.
ok so you are saying you signed a guy who produced as though his QB was Zach Wilson despite having Aaron Rodgers?
Go read the score of the last four times we met in the playoffs.
...that doesn't even make sense
Big ooffff
I'm pretty sure it was actually Love
If we're basing this off of a single play, sure.  If we're basing it on the four passes he attempted for you guys, sure.  If we're basing it on his "let's throw twice as many picks as TD's" stint in Detroit, no way. He's beyond awful.
Dude, do a quick google of Tim Boyles college career and tell me he’s better than Zach Wilson.
Tim Boyle had a 11-13 TD-INT ratio in the FCS.
No no, the Packers have planned for cap screwing, they can just keep him and get nothing, they have all the leverage.  -Packers fans
I think I'm neutral.. I wanna beat Rodgers personally, but.. idc either way
The Aaron Rodgers drama drove him insane, poor thing.
I suspect a lot of double-rival flairs were raised by parents who supported the opposing sides
what the actual fuck?
He is colorblind and thinks it’s a Georgia Bulldogs flair.
And then promptly watch all of that young talent leave because they can't afford it.
No idea. I think it happens with the Packers though. I think they'll end up giving a little more than they want but it'll be worth it. I just see no way that they don't trade for a veteran after every move they've made seems to implicate it and they can't afford to have another average year with the talent they have.
LEVERAGE!!

No
You can have 2, you can have as many as you want
The Packers can't cut him, they can not make sufficient cap space to make it work since his cap hit if cut is 75 million (after June 1) and 99 million before June 1. If the trade falls through the Packers would either hope he retires or welcome him back to play (if they are paying him 60 million in cash he is the starter).  Both sides have said variations of they are fine waiting.  Packers saying something to the effect of "there is always a chance" when asked if he could come back if trades don't work out, and the Jets saying "a QB who knows the system can pick it up quickly without issue so no rush to get him in the building"  Oh, and to be clear both teams aren't being completely honest in this regard.  Both want to get it done prior to the draft and that is the most likely outcome.  Packers are lying because they obviously don't want the headache particularly come training camp as that would really hinder their ability to run an offseason and evaluate Love if Rodgers was there (I doubt he shows up for most of OTAs but mandatory mini camp and camp are no brainers).  The Jets are lying because there is more to it than the QB knowing the offense, building chemistry, being involved in building the offense, everyone getting on the same page is all important particularly with Rodgers who is known for effectively running a second offense within the offense.
I never understood why so many people get mad at him for missing voluntary OTAs  Quite a few big name people skip but I only see people complain about rodgers
That would be catastrophic to the Packers cap though.  They'd offer him to any team that would take him at that point for a 7th.  Hell, might even cost you draft capital at that point to move him if this Jets thing falls through.    As a fellow NFCN fan, this would make my summer, but I don't think Rodgers would absolutely destroy his legacy with the Packers to spite them.  He's petty, but not that petty.  Plus I don't think he want's to play 2nd fiddle to Brady for their HOF induction.
How is Green Bay screwing the Jets? Jets want Rodgers, Packers set the price.  Jets say that’s too much.  Packers say well we will just wait and see if there are other offers or wait until the lesser return becomes more advantageous to us.    Jets make all sorts of moves to appease a player they don’t yet have.    Deal falls apart, Rodgers isn’t traded to the Jets.  The Jets screwed themselves in that situation.  The Jets made an agreement with Rodgers not the team.  The Packers didn’t go back on a deal, there never was a deal.
I am not a jets fan my team equally sucks lol. But to see your young roster another year with shit QB play would be horrible. Worst case a trade for Stafford ?
I’ve seen your recent comments re: Rodgers. Do you think people take you seriously?
Is that like how you have to read about your Super Bowls cause none of us were alive yet?
listen man.  as a ARSB fantasy owner since 2021, Boyle got me main man 111 yards and TD in my championship. ARSB happened to also get a 2nd RuTD, but i digress.  TB12 fan for life for that dude getting me $1000 and another year of league champion.
Have you seen our roster? We are 25% Georgia Bulldog.
You don't think he'll take less to be in a loaded offense? I think he should tbh.. especially given the fact that winning will earn him more in the long run
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Respectfully.
Not sex, procreation
I don't care that he skips I hope I didn't give that impression. Just that if he decides to show up this year after skipping for years that would annoy me
It would be pretty shit but we're kind of *already* in a pretty shit situation regardless these next couple seasons, there's no way we let him go for a 7th lolllllll
i see him wanting to keep moving up on the accumulation stats too. he is 33 tds behind favre and 2300 yards behind marino
The point of my question is it sounds like Rodgers and Lazard are going to produce slightly above Zach Wilson numbers! Very exciting
No we just have to use VHS tapes
No, I think he's made it clear he only cares about himself. Whatever team HD signs with, he's going to set the team back 5 years. It'll be worse than Wilson's contract. The Bears should sign him.
im tired boss men
Nah didn't get that impression sorry your comment just brought that to my mind sorry lol
If Rodgers is traded you have $40 million in dead cap. If he retires you have $100 million in dead cap. If he retires pre-June 1st then that's $100 million against this year's cap (if post June 1st then 75/25 split). Rodgers will be traded.
I don’t care how unlikely it is, this is my new favorite outcome. Rodgers retires. Packers field an XFL team for a year.   Don’t worry Pack fans, I was around for 0-16. I can teach you how to cope. Drinking helps.
Yeah I think it's likely Rodgers gets traded but incredibly unlikely there isn't at least a 3rd involved.  I think the Packers would rather sit on a shit team for a year or two than let someone else have Rodgers for a 7th.
I mean yeah, we went mostly all-in on Rodgers the last couple seasons, pushing all his money to the future, and it didn't work out.   We were gonna be fielding a shit team for a few years after Rodgers, regardless, I really doubt they settle for something like a 7th just to get rid of him.  I also really doubt there isn't another team that would take a chance on a one-year-removed B2B MVP if he's still here closer to the season. If the jets don't work out, someone else will give us a lower offer, sure, but you're setting yourself up for disappointment if you think we're trading him for a 7th.
they are gonna draft AR after they trade up with us. BOOK IT.
The Pats do love their SEC players

What exactly is a "Top 30 visit"? I don't think I'd heard that term before this year (maybe last year). Is it different from a normal pre-draft visit somehow? Or is it just a word that the media uses for players expected to go high?
Sorry, but what exactly differentiates a normal visit from a top 30 visit?
Drafting Mac Jones made them think they should take the complete opposite type of prospect lmao.
You will draft Will Anderson and you will like it
As in Andrew Thomas the LT on the Giants from Georgia? He was a pro bowler this past season.  Turns out David Gettleman was actually good at something.
He is one of the best lt in football after a bad start
He's been caught in the injuries/poor performance vortex for years now.
Isaiah Wynn? Injuries wrecked the potential he had
He’s ass
You can invite (up to) 30 prospects for pre-draft visits, where you can meet with and interview (for longer than the allotted time at the combine) the player, as well as have them take a physical.  Worth noting that a player who went to college or lives less than 50 miles from the team’s facility can come in for a visit that doesn’t count towards the 30 visit maximum
If y’all didn’t draft Fields I was 100% sure he was going to the Pats and man that’s a scary thought
DG is good at 2 things  1) first round picks  2) hogmollies  Andrew Thomas is both
He was 2nd team all pro last year and could have been 1st team
Mostly injuries if we're talking whole contract instead of just last year. He was pretty average as a LT but very bad when we decided to let Matt Patricia turn him into a RT.
So it's exactly the same as it's always been the just started adding the "top" part to it then. Huh.
I remember sitting in my living room on draft night. Only one I ever watched because I knew the pats would be drafting our next QB.  I watched the Broncos pass on him. By the time the Panthers were up I was holding my breath. I wanted to cry when they both went CB. Then of course OF COURSE, the god damn GIANTS OF ALL TEAMS, trade back to let the Bears take the QB I was hoping for. Biggest case of blue balls ever man. Then Mac came strutting down the hall like that god damn big Putin meme and wide birthing hips and I wanted to completely off myself.  Being a bit dramatic, and Mac proved me wrong year 1 for sure, but still… still bitter.
It’s kinda why we did it tbh
yeah his first rounders were good for the most part  Saquon- he got a lot of flak for this one but seeing how Baker, Darnold and Rosen have panned out it doesn't look as bad. Given the context of that draft they weren't ready to move on from Eli just yet.  Daniel Jones: as good of a year DJ had this year, because of his play in 2020 & 2021 we still can't give Gettleman the nod there, at least for another year or 2.  Dexter Lawrence - 10/10 pick for sure. He's gonna have an even bigger year in 2023.  Deandre Baker: complete whiff. Terrible decision to trade up to pick him. Easily could have drafted DK or Terry Mclaurin with that pick.  Andrew Thomas: excellent pick for sure  Kadarius Toney: LOL. At least we got more draft capital as a result and set up Schoen for a quality draft....he was high on Evan Neal and strongly recommended to Schoen's people he's the guy they should get. OTOH Schoen essentially got Darren Waller and a 6th round pick for Toney so all together we made out well after drafting a dud.  never the less if 4 out of 6 first round picks are going to be on 2nd contracts with the team, he drafted a lot better than Jerry Reese did in 10 years.  He was great at scouting but sucked at everything else.
Yeah, I guess I'm taking the view from the earliest days where he looked great at LT. Then he got injured and came back at a "good, not great" level. Then last year was a mess.  I still think there might be a good LT in there as long as the injuries haven't completely sapped his career. But at this stage we can't rely on him to play at a high level as a starter.
I'd bring him back for the right price. Just for the love of god keep him on the left side.
If you ever wonder why we were the equivalent of the Cleveland Browns in the 70s and 80s, look no further than Dan Devine.  Ever since that trade, we only had one playoff win in those two decades, and it was on a strike shortened season.  We didn't become relevant again until we hired Ron Wolf, handed Lindy Infante his pink slip all before hiring Mike Holmgren.
Great post, but didn’t GB draft a serial killer?
I’m surprised this story is considered boring by Packers fans.  I’m not old enough to have been through this, but I’ve spent many hours watching games and talking Packers with my dad and not once has this story come up.  I quite enjoyed it.  Thank you!
I'm so bored of the same old John Hadl story, I'm disappointed you went this direction.  Oh well, can't win them all.  I've enjoyed all your other ones so far
NFC Central Legend Dan Devine
Yeah. I threw Randall Woodfield in the honorable mentions-- but yeah, that was an insane pick with hindsight!
He may have just been trying to repress the memory!  Thanks though! I appreciate it.
Sorry dude-- I was so sick of the Aaron Rodgers story and actually knew super little about the Hadl story. I learned a lot-- and obviously, if I don't know it, that means no one else did because I'm a genius. Or something like that...  Hopefully, the next few will work better!   Since you're a Packers fan, what would you have picked for a crazy draft moment?
Most of us non-packer fans probably hadn't heard it though, and that's kinda the point of OPs stories. It's about your team, not about *you* if you know what I mean.   Great work u/TemporaryGospel, keep it up!
I'm a younger fan so Hadl is new to me lol.  Everyone knows the Aaron story and Jordan Love hasn't completely panned out yet either.
  >Since you're a Packers fan, what would you have picked for a crazy draft moment?   I don't know.  I'd probably just find a way to write about 1943's first round pick, **Dick Wildung**.   Because the name.
I mean for nothing to do with football.  Randall Woodfield, the I5 killer, was a Packers draft pick
That's the fun part about the draft, sometimes! Every year, the stories come a little more alive and have new wrinkles. Jordan Love can still be a franchise-altering bust or a historic great!   Meanwhile, John Hadl is unlikely to contribute much more to Green Bay.
Ya but he was a 17th rounder and was cut in camp. I don't think there's much of a football story there.
I don't understand why they made such a big deal out of it. You can repeat the same generic non-answer answer. Let's be real, literally no one expects anything in these predraft pressers to be true.  Not a big deal but kinda embarrassing the PR team had to step in lmao.
It feels like “with the Lamar situation, does that change your draft strategy” is asking about the draft but idk that’s just me I guess.
It’s like asking a strictly 80s Billy Joel cover band to play music from The Stranger. Extremely disturbing.
"Who are you going to draft?"  "We can't tell you that."
> respect the process  *ptsd intensifies*
I can understand that thought process, but honestly, it just seems unrealistic to expect the reporters to not ask questions about Lamar. Lamar is basically the only thing on anybody's mind. Reporters know this, the people who read their work don't really give a shit about hearing what kind of corner the Ravens might look for in the draft -- never mind that this is typically referred to as the "Liar's Lunch" because of how often they say one thing and then go in a different direction.   There's just not much point talking about the draft when it is dwarfed by "what the fuck is going on with the QB of the team?"
I’m just here so I don’t sign Lamar
Will you be drafting your next starting an in the draft?
If they had just thrown out a generic PR answer I doubt any of us would have even seen the interview. Now it's been getting replayed all morning on shows and I've seen multiple posts about it.
I sincerely wish they had answered every question with “Stetson Bennet, no matter what.”
I think it wasn’t great, but they were likely trying to avoid having it turn into a “Let’s talk about Lamar” press conference. If you give the generic non-answer, some of the reporters will just keep digging, asking the same thing in a different way. It ends up just being a huge waste of time.
The nickname for this meeting is literally the "Liars' Luncheon", the media know draft questions are meaningless.
I take the opinion that they should have been happy to get the Lamar questions. Move the conversation away from the draft so you don’t risk a slip of the tongue there.   It’s not like the Lamar situation can get any worse at this point.
He's living rent free in their heads.
I mean, you can't really separate the two. Having a coherent draft strategy at all depends on resolving the Lamar situation.
If I were a media member and feeling froggy I would have gone full ass.  “Oh no questions about Lamar?”  “So with the question mark at Quarterback what’s your strategy? Have you talked with Richardson or Levis?”   If they called on me again:  “So will you target a high end wide receiver in an attempt to lure back a Pro Bowl caliber QB who is currently not showing up?”   Just ask bullshit questions centered Lamar without saying his name.
Yea, if they can't respect that, then they should take their skank hooker wife and get the fuck out of there
Hey listen mother fucker, we only sing 80s Joel! So take your skank hooker wife and get the fuck out of here!
But hasn't the team already addresses the Lamar situation as much as they can? I get that people are curious, but what else can the team do/say at this point? I thought the PR team stepping in to ask that questions be focused on the draft was reasonable.
We're all going to forget about this anyhow in a few weeks
>	I think it wasn’t great, but they were likely trying to avoid having it turn into a “Let’s talk about Lamar” press conference.   They literally did that though.
> I think it wasn’t great, but they were likely trying to avoid having it turn into a “Let’s talk about Lamar” press conference.   Pretending that any discussion of the draft is meaningful without addressing the Lamar Question is beyond silly, though.
I was trying to think of the name we used for it and all I could come up with was “Bluffers Banquet” lmao
>It’s not like the Lamar situation can get any worse at this point.  As long as he’s not signed, it can always get worse. I don’t see him backing down honestly. Could see this going well into June quite frankly.
It's the liars luncheon. A slip of the tongue would go unnoticed because it's assumed everything said regarding drafts is a lie.
That’s smart of him, free rent AND saving 1% on not having an agent. He’s on his way to becoming a billionaire.
It's the Fucking Catalina wine mixer.
Yes, they've had several press conferences around it.  The Ravens staff does a pre-draft conference every year and they wanted it to go as per normal.  When 3 of the first 4 questions bring up Lamar's impact, the PR team stepped in and tried to redirect the questions to the draft as a whole and not how Lamar has anything to do with it.  I think it's totally fair, especially given that the question immediately preceding the one that cut off was nearly the same question anyway and EDC answered it just fine.
They have, but what they did becomes the story.   The proper tactic is to consistently and with discipline give the most mind numbing non news answer every time it is brought up, so they get bored and move on.
Not really. This is a "Why won't they let us hear the same questions about Lamar" topic... Which is slightly yet critically different. It also sets the tone for the next roundup because everyone in NFL media saw this and knows they'll get shut down. It can happen 100 times to the same result, but at least we aren't creating a news cycle with a misquoted article or attempts to draw lines and read between them.
But the Lamar question HAS been addressed. It's been addressed so much the media is looking to find another Lamar angle so they can keep addressing it.  What likely happened is EDC or Harbs (EDC is my guess) told our PR team we don't have anything to say that hasn't been said. I could see it being like "If we rear up and shut down Lamar questions everyone and their mother will run with it and create an angle. If we continue to answer the questions we run the risk of answers being misconstrued during a critical negotiation period and AGAIN refreshing the news cycle with speculation. If YOU step in and shut it down it will, at worst, look like our PR team doesn't want to have us answer Lamar question and it stops there."  Let's be honest. Going the route of non-answers around Lamar's injuries and his contract this long hasn't done anyone favors. It's made Lamar look bad at times, Harbs look bad at times... I'm of the belief the best option is to tell the media to back off and review and of the 100 interviews they've had regarding the situation and write a new blog using those quotes or this one.
I won’t be surprised if he plays this year on the tag.
Ha well played. Look I don't really care what happens but at this point I'm enjoying the show and seeing how much it enrages some people just because his approach isn't the norm.
There’s literally no point in the Ravens talking about the draft without accounting for the Lamar situation.
>  but what they did becomes the story.   So what? It's not a big deal and, to the extent that's even true, it won't be a story for long.
> But the Lamar question HAS been addressed.  So he's playing under the tag?
Literally nobody is enraged.
Absolutely there is - there's all sorts of players and positions available to draft.  Everyone knows where the Lamar situation currently stands - the team has directly talked about that several times.  The entire draft doesn't center around Lamar, particularly if they have hopes that he plays this year for us.  Not sure why that's tough for so many to seem to understand.
Sure, but if your job is PR having the news be “look what Ravens PR said about Lamar!” is not ideal.
TBD. That question has been asked and that question has been addressed. The plan is to assume Lamar will be on the roster day 1.  Next question.
Yes that was hyperbole. But plenty of folks are upset about it and that's all I was responding to.
>	The entire draft doesn’t center around Lamar, particularly if they have hopes that he plays this year for us.  Do you not understand the irony of this sentence?  Unless you unironically believe that the Ravens draft would be identical regardless of whether or not they have Lamar, it quite literally does center around him.
I guess? From the outside looking in, it just seems like a big nothingburger.
What happens if he isn't?  What happens if he plays 6 games and sits the rest, this accruing a year?  What happens if a team signs him after the draft and they have 7 weeks to match?
Literally nobody is upset.
Center around and impacted by are very, very different things. I didn’t say not impacted by, I said not centered around. I’m not sure how you don’t see the separation and stark difference in those statements.
Each of those scenarios have been covered one way or another by answers in probably a dozen other interviews over the past couple of months. Which is my point, there's nothing to ask that hasn't been covered in some way. So why bullshit and entertain the relentlessly redundant questions?
Literally someone is upset somewhere. Bet ya a dollar
Analysts will say crazy shit to get you to pay attention.  It only will get worse as we get closer.
They aren’t
If you are actually hearing people say he should be 1.1 (which I doubt is very common at all) I am sure those people will follow that statement up with why they think that.
Upside. Almost every QB drafted needs to fix something with their passing. Richardson has more to fix than most, but with his skill set, he doesn't have to be a great pocket passer to be considered an MVP level talent. Young and Stroud don't really have the ceiling that other QBs who have been recently drafted No. 1 overall. They are closer to Jared Goff than Burrow or Lawerence as prospects go.
Allow me to introduce you to the concept of "clickbait".
People are bored and need something to talk about, so the shit-flinging ensues until draft time arrives.
Typical Pre-Draft hype, Pre-Draft misdirection by other teams /front offices, mixed with a slow news cycle.
He has a good agent
Cause he has an agent that clearly has good media ties lol
I haven’t heard anyone say that.
No one is saying that
Richardson is the most physically gifted QB in the draft. Strongest arm, biggest frame, best runner. They know that is he’s drafted to a team with an all-star coaching staff like Mahomes and Allen were, there’s a chance he will at least be better than average at the next level. And I don’t disagree with that logic, but it shouldn’t make him their top prospect
Crazy stuff happens every year.  Baker was mocked going around 10th and then was selected first.  Somebody drafted the titty kisser over Mahomes and Watson.  AR could go first or fall to 10th, no one knows.  I can see the argument for his upside being the highest, so it's a huge risk/reward scenario.
No idea. If you cant complete 60% of your passes in college you shouldnt even be drafted lol
I have a feeling Richardson is just another Malik Willis, Trey Lance, Paxton lynch etc. All QBs only touted for their physical traits but no tape to convince me he can be a good QB
For clicks.
Gotta say something controversial to keep you interested
Hot takes get clicks
I don’t have him QB1 (Young is) but I am tempted to put him there. I just don’t think he’s as raw as people make him out to be I guess. Stroud doesn’t do enough when shit breaks down for me. If someone agreed with that and had big concerns about Young’s size I could understand putting AR at 1
Be honest, if you scrolled onto an article now that said Stroud or Young was QB1 then you’d give it less attention  As for hot takes Keep throwing them out there and if you’re right then brag about it forever.  If you’re wrong then nobody remembers.
I've seen it said a lot that his tape isn't as bad as people assume from the 55 cmp%, and his upside is sky high. I also haven't seen this outside of a very well reasoned (at least until I hit the paywall) piece from a pff guy. There's a lot of reason to think QB rushing is more valuable than ever, and it is gives him the ability to see the field as he develops the rest, and on top of that makes it easier for him to do while also being a force multiplier for a team's rushing attack. Still a huge risk, but not much more so than it always is drafting a QB
So I will say this: the people who do draft analysis who have gotten really high on Richardson are people who hadn't really dove into his tape during the college season, and only recently finished watching/grading/charting his snaps.  And the takes I've seen from them is that you can see him doing a lot of real QB stuff that doesn't necessarily show up on the stat sheet, and that he's way less of a project than people think. So you combine that with literally the most athletic person to ever play the QB position, and you can see why some people view him as the 1.01 guy.
He’s not. Those people think Madden is real life.
Purely for clicks at this point. This is one of those threads people may come back to years later and say "Wow, we sure were stupid thinking Richardson would bust and Young/Stroud were 1 and 2!", but realistically Richsrdson had a terrible college career and a great pro day. There's many QBs that were very similar, unfortunately Zach Wilson was one of them.  Basically, it's to drive clicks. I believe if Wilson didn't bust as hard as he did, we'd be seeing a lot more people saying it, but now it's only the brave few
Who cares?
Supposedly Reich if he had his choice, it would be Richardson just based on what he would look like 2-3 years down the road according to Tony Pauline
because cocaine is a hell of a drug
They're smoking crack perhaps
We've reached the clickbait/smokescreen part of the draft process.  Guys with huge questions will be propped up.  Guys with near perfect profiles will be nit-picked to death.  Everything is with the agenda of getting another team to do something your team wants.    Richardson is barely a QB prospect at this point of the draft - He's an offensive weapon that currently lines up at QB.  But he doesn't have the accuracy or decision making to be anything more than a gimmick currently.  He's Lamar Jackson+ with more passing questions but more athletic ability.  If you have a group that can sit him for a year and teach him - then MAYBE you take him over some of the other guys.    But right now and for the near future - Stroud and Young are good to great prospects.  Young has size concerns.  Stroud isn't near as athletic as Young/Richardson.  Stroud also has the Ohio St QB stigma.  But on a production level - those 2 dwarf Richardson.  Richardson also has the 1 year of starting stigma - which is ridiculously accurate when translating to "lack" of NFL success.    Levis belongs in this conversation too as a QB with "traits" but production and decision making problems.    As a Raiders fan - I don't trust Josh McDaniels to develop a QB "from scratch" like Richardson would take.  So Stroud or Young early or Levis/Hooker late - would be where I'm looking.    With "newer" regimes in both Houston and Carolina - I'd feel similarly.    Now if I had just hired say "Andy Reid" or "John Harbaugh" and had the #1 overall pick - then Richardson would be firmly in play.
Just attention seekers looking for clicks and engagement. I doubt they actually believe he will go first overall.
Because they didn't watch a second of Florida football last year
JaMarcus Russell 2.0
Because it's lying season and there's tons of air time to fill before the draft.
You can just repeat something over and over again and the majority of people will believe it is true without any evidence or logic it's called the Illusory Truth Effect
Expect to see some mocks with Levi's going #1. These mocks draft people will say anything for clicks
Engagement/click farming
No one really is unless they want headlines. He has the best potential but he wont be QB1
Because some team with a high pick wants to trade down and maximize value
Being good at football doesn't matter, he's the most athletic and that's all that correlates to NFL success at the QB position.
1.  Not many people are saying that.  People inflate a few analysts as the majority opinion.  Kind of like when you read articles of “GEN Z IS TRYING TO CANCEL ______” when if you ask anyone they don’t know what the hell you’re talking about. 2. He’s the most athletic qb ever and his pocket presence is actually pretty good and his awful accuracy can be explained.  If he was in a better system that wasn’t asking him to chuck yolo balls to terrible receivers, I don’t think we would be talking about his accuracy problems.  He’s probably a lot closer to Levi’s in that area.   3.  It’s the lead up to the draft, this shit happens every year
It always bothers me when people see one or two people say a thing and act like that’s the overall sentiment. People will say anything. Please understand that and don’t let it bother u lol
I always laugh at these, "why are people saying" posts. It's just such a dumb fucking question. It's like asking why Fox News says something they say. This is media buddy. It's literally supposed to get you to debate shit that doesn't matter so you keep talking about shit that doesn't matter so you keep consuming shit that doesn't matter so they can cram you full of ads.  You lost this one.
Analysts are saying anything to keep people interested
Boredom. Draft community was talking about Young and Stroud for so long they get bored and tired of the repetitive takes and over analysis. People start looking into AR s numbers and highlights and are finding a lot to get them excited
Because clicks is how you get money and "journalists" are basically just part of the sales department now.
Bryce Young has been praised for his football IQ test.  I wonder where Anthony Richardson ranks for football IQ testing.
do we have to ask this question every single day? why mitch trubisky qb1 why blake bortles qb1 why josh allen
This is definitely the weirdest QB class in a while. All 4 top qbs have a very low floor IMO and Hooker is a few years away from getting social security
Because it’s the off-season and the only thing to talk about is free agents and the draft. So generating views and clicks from absurd stuff like this is all that’s left
He looks real good in shorts and does well when there isn't a defense on the field to appose him?
Same reason why my buddies think every hot stripper can be wife material: they're idiots who never learn to see beyond flashy physical traits.
Who the fuck is saying that
It's fantasy football rookie draft content bleeding into the real NFL draft coverage
I’m not sure if this has been said/asked but does he even go through his read progressions? The videos I have watched shows him looking at his first read and either throwing right away, forcing it in or just taking off on a run. If I’m wrong please feel free to point it out so I can be better informed.
It really seems like Richardson's athleticism is really being overrated, because raw athleticism is not that important for the qb position. Look at your all time great qbs and then look at the greatest "athletic" qbs. Its not even close.
The only thing to pay attention to is the Athletic's draft Consensus Board.   They have a good track record for QBs.   The didn't foresee Malik Willis' fall to the 3rd round but they had him in the 30s when the popular media and podcast sphere was talking about him as a top10-15 pick.
I don't think Nate Tice loves Anthony Richardson for attention. I think he just loves Richardson.  He isn't the only tape guy I follow that I doubt is doing it for clicks. \*A lot\* of them love ARich and say his tape is actually pretty good.
And this is as crazy as it gets. There are at least four other better QBs! At least!!
It’s really not crazy to have Richardson as QB1. It’s not some looney toon take just because you disagree with it.
>It only will get worse as we get closer.  I actually think it starts to get better as we get close to the draft. Right now we're three weeks out and teams are keeping things close to their chest. So media outlets and what have you start circling around talking points and trying to generate buzz.   Usually a week out from the draft, insiders start to get real scoops and we start hearing real news. Like last year if someone said a month before the draft that Stingley would go before Gardner, most people would say they're nuts. But then a few days before the draft that started being rumored, and of course it's what happened.
The offseason is hell in all media.  I usually tune out outside of randomly checking /r/nfl for signings.
Then coaches and GM's will say/leak crazy shit to media to create smokescreens.   Most of what we hear right now is trash.
Yup. After two years of undisputed number ones (Burrow/Tlaw) they've been wild as fuck the last two draft seasons
> Richardson has more to fix than most, but with his skill set, he doesn't have to be a great pocket passer to be considered an MVP level talent.  My issue with that style of play is that it leads to a very shortened career.
Why? Burrow and Lawrence weren't drafted for their exceptional athleticism in spite of terrible decision making / accuracy. Also BY, considered the clear #1 by at least half of the analysts I've read, is not the best pocket passer of this class.
You're right overall but don't put Burrow in that category. All of the other great young QBs have amazing physical traits but Burrow is the exception.
I disagree. Timo Riskee from PFF, Charles McDonald from Yahoo, and Benjamin Solak from The Ringer have all said this.
Josh Allen would have been one hell of a UDFA
Malik Willis is such a lazy comp. Guy didn’t know anything about playing the position.
You mean that 33% completion rate against FSU didn't wow you?
Zach Wilson had a bad college career? In what world?  We just making shit up now I guess
Richardson started 1 season. Look at the stats for other people’s first years starting.      He’s only 20 years old. I think it’s just lazy for people to look at his college completion percentage and say it’s impossible to have him as QB1 in this class.
Wilson was a monster at BYU.
Same as when they were reporting on Travon Walker going top 5 for all those clicks
OP cared enough to make a thread, I guess.
That’s because Dane Brugler knows what the hell he’s talking about. When he says something/talks about it in The Beast every year, everyone should pay attention.
So where does Richardson fall on that list?
Arif Hasan (who was with the athletic until this year) has a great consensus board on pro football network. No paywall and the same work he was doing at the athletic +some new info now.
I mean, you’ve seen my posts in the draft sub. I love Richardson because I think he’s talented as hell, not because I think it’s funny. I’ve been pounding the table for him since the fall…if I didn’t believe in him, I definitely wouldn’t post and subject myself to the comments I get haha  **(Yes I know I’m not Tice or DJ or Brugler, and not on their level, just speaking from my own POV)**
Yea lots of people who are tape guys all say that Richardsons tapes exonerates him for lots of the florida offensive failures, and that the lack of playmakers down field and good design is what did them in. Not an insane take to have.
User name checks out...
I totally understand this with the Panthers. As a Saints fan, Richardson is the QB I'm the most scared of the Panthers drafting because if he becomes just an average passer, he'll be an absolute monster to deal with in the division. But if I was a Panthers fan, I'm not sure I'd be OK with the risk that he'll never be a good enough passer or the inherent injury risk with his play style. That Cam Newton decline is still fresh.
Yeah that’s a wild take lol. Decision making capability is the hardest thing to predict. We have no idea at this point.
Burrow had the greatest college season of all time. I think that puts him up with the top.
People have different opinions. The consensus is still Stroud or Bryce as QB1, but Richardson's upside will appeal to different analysts/front offices/coaches who value that more highly.  I'm sure if you took a poll of all 32 teams you'd get at least 1 team who would have the 4 top QB's as QB1
It's hot take season.   It doesn't matter how many times you get it wrong.   Richardson is one of the best athletes to hit the QB position in a long time, but he's raw as hell. If a team can hone him, he could be great.   These guys are just throwing out "Richardson is my QB1" right now so that, if in 5 years he turns into the best QB in the class, they can point back and go "told you so!"  If he flames out, they get to say "yeah I was a little off on that one" and move on.   You have either listened to their takes, clicked on their articles, or at a minimum are passing on their info, and that makes them saying it Worth It.
Own that fraud
If true, its just to generate clicks and get people talking. Everyone knows hes not QB1. His ceiling makes him QB3 at best (in terms of the draft order for QBs) and it wouldnt be a shock to see a team try to jump ahead of Seattle or Detroit to grab him but hes not gonna be the 1st QB taken.
It’s sort of amazing how many people think “ummmm ackchyually nobody is saying that” adds literally anything to this thread or this subreddit. Even if you disagree with it or just think people are saying it for clicks (which dipshits on r/NFL have said about plenty of storylines that turned out to be true), you would have to almost literally follow no draft coverage at all to think that that opinion literally doesn’t exist.
I keep telling people to look at Josh Allen's college stats. He lit up the combine, had a rocket arm and was drafted on potential and it's worked out. let's compare their JR seasons, both their last season.  Allen, Games played 11, 56.3 comp %, 1812 passing yards. 16 TD, 6 Ints. Rushing 202 yards, Avg 2.2 per carry, 5tds.   Richardson, Games played 12, 53.8 comp %,  2549 passing yards, 17 tds,  9ints. 654 yards rushing, Avg 6.3 per carry, 9 TDs.  Big difference for me is Richardson played in the SEC, his stats would be wild IMO if he played in the MTN West... Also that yards per carry in the SEC... He's similar size as Allen and runs a 4.4 and unbelievably athletic. both were average passers in college and if Richardson can be at worst an average passer in the NFL, with his rushing skills, he definitely has a chance to succeed. We only got a small sample size from him in college, and he's 20.... Ideally you sit him a year and let him learn. But I understand the hype and potential.
But 1.1? At least with Hutch there was some moving around there, but this would be like saying Fields was going over Lawrence. It would be crazy to trade so much for the dude who just looked good at the combine
This year's Beast is supposed to come out on Monday. I am eagerly waiting for it.
Consensus board has nothing to do with Dane it’s a aggregate of media draft experts by Austin Mock. He also only updates it like once a month so it not actually that useful until the week of the draft.
They have him 21st on Board 4.0 up from 30th.
same brother
Yet trying to express that on this sub often gets people quoting box scores to you and telling you the All 22 isn’t something worthwhile if it’s convincing you Richardson is good…
He certainly wasn't in an ideal situation, but it's not hard to watch the tape and see him missing gimme throws.   People love him because if he's able to fix his issues, he could easily be the best QB in the class in like 5 years.
Cam Newton took them to a super bowl though. My team hasn't been to a super bowl with our above average super healthy pocket passer.  I would trade 10 years of decent QB play for a few good years that actually get my team in the damn game.
Burrow deserved to go number 1 overall, yeah, but I don't believe his upside was higher than Young/Stroud.
>but he's raw as hell.  None of the people OP mentioned think he is "raw as hell" fwiw.
I don’t understand why it’s unfathomable to some people that Richardson is QB1.      He’s not somebody you need to build from the ground up like Malik Willis, he’s got plenty to like and if he’s interviewing well to demonstrate a high football IQ/high capacity for learning, you can’t help but drool over the potential. Has the best pocket presence in this class.      And worst case scenario, he’s still the best athlete to ever play the position. Justin Fields is absolute dogshit at passing, pocket presence, and reading the field, but he can make things happen with his athleticism alone.
Thinking he’s the best prospect in the class is different from mocking him going #1 overall. It’s probably Bryce with the first pick, but there are even people in the NFL who think Levis is the best prospect of the bunch.
You gotta remember that this entire website is designed around the lowest common denominator
I believe Burrow had both a higher ceiling and a higher floor than Young/Stroud. He was an all around better prospect than either of them. It's telling that neither Stroud nor Young has separated themselves from the other like Burrow did from the rest of his class. The prospects that are a tier above Young/Stroud stand alone.
I understand that but OP was under the impression those people were saying he would be QB1. I havent seen the articles so if theyre saying prospect then, yeah, perhaps he is given his insane athleticisin. He could be the type that could play another position like WR or TE if he were to fail as a QB. And the Levis thing is a good point as well.
We're just gonna have to agree to disagree. Obviously Burrow was a better prospect than Young/Stroud but that's because he was seen as a sure thing whereas Young/Stroud are not. It wasn't about his ceiling.
I think you're missing the point a bit here.  Burrow doesn't have remotely the physical upside as the other young qb's you're comparing him to.    He's an above average athlete, but nothing special and has a pretty average arm as far as arm strength goes.  What's made him special is his accuracy, ability to read defenses, and clutch factor.  He's much closer as a prospect to Young and Stroud than he is to Anthony Richardson, Josh Allen, or Patrick Mahomes, who were all physical specimens but relatively unproven in their college careers.   Edit: LOL he blocked me  Edit 2:  unfortunately I can't reply to anyone on this thread because Mr. Thin skin above me was so bothered by me disagreeing with him that he blocked me.
No OP is talking about people who believe the Panthers *should* take Richardson 1st overall, not that they expect it to happen.
We're talking about as a prospect out of college though. Scouts take accuracy, ability to read defenses, and clutch factor into account when evaluating prospects. It's not entirely based on physicality. Lawrence was one of the highest regarded prospects ever and he's not some insane physical specimen.
Ah, well, I havent read the articles. If thats their opinion, I disagree with it even though I do like ARs athleticisim. I think Carolina should take Stroud/Young and either Seattle/Detroit take AR if they believe he can be better than what they have now within 2 years.
Lawrence absolutely is an insane physical specimen in the same league as Justin Herbert. You don't get to be one of the highest rated HS recruits of all time without being an insane physical specimen.
Ok sure, compare him to Herbert. But we were talking about Allen and Richardson. Would you put Lawrence in the same league as them?
The person you replied to included Patrick Mahomes too. Clearly we're not just talking about lower body athleticism, we're including arm talent — guys that can make alien throws. I would categorize arm talent as an amazing physical trait which is what this whole discussion was about in the first place.
Wheres the "insert wide receiver" seen at logan airport meme picture people???
I love Zay Flowers and think he will be a great player. 14 seems a bit aggressive to pick him but if you think he can be your guy than worth it.
>New England has the No. 14 pick, three weeks from today.  Which will be used to trade back for 5-6 random picks in the 5th-7th rounds
Damn elite level talent in New England right now
Quick, deploy the Logan Airport Hertz rental counter meme, STAT!
Kraft's grandson is a walk on WR for BC. Wouldn't be surprised if the family has been watching Zay dominate for years and encourages Belichick to make it happen.
I have a feeling this is a match, think JSN goes shortly before maybe Texans.
After the last 3 offensively anemic years I would love to see some high level offensive weapons on the team.
I feel like he may emerge as the best WR from this draft class.
If you produced at Boston college, your probably going to be a dog in the nfl.  I want him
That means I've got 3 weeks to start learning about random players from no name schools for when we trade down to pick 21 and take some guy that no one expected  (Im feeling a linebacker)
He is a little smaller but I see a lot of DJ Moore in Zay. Will be a great fit for any offense
Flowers very well could be the best WR in this draft. Seriously, he’s got good speed, but more importantly that (Amari Cooper) route running.   I’d rather see him go to the patriots than the Chargers that’s for sure.
Imagine learning the offense for a team that might not even draft you
I originally JSN as my head and shoulders beat WR this draft.  I still think JSN is probably the best but Flowers doesn’t seem very far behind.
Every receiver chosen in the first 100 picks has approximately equal probability of success. The correlation between what round a receiver is picked, and their career efficacy, is really weak.
Not me licking my lips as Quentin Johnston slowly becomes the 3rd ranked WR
FSU fan here, this guy is electric. One of the few players that just jumps out when watching. Reminds me of Percy Harvin a bit. The goal was always to mitigate his presence, not stop because we couldn't. If he was on Alabama, the hype for him would be unreal. One of the best smaller WRs I have seen in some time. Shame he was on some terrible BC teams.
Trading out to 20-25, grabbing Zay or JSN, and getting an extra day 2 pick is my ideal scenario.
This type of stuff cracks me up. "Man travels for work and goes straight to work after landing." What do you think the rest of us do?
I’m loving this pick.
Caught a glimpse of the guy when BC played Wake Forest. He impressed the shit outta me. You could just tell he had amazing potential. Hope he does well, glad to see him so sought-after now.
Yeah, I already gave up to the fact he won't make it to the Ravens at pick 22.
Zay is great, but have you ever gotten a 5th and next years 6th instead?
Bill’s had his issues with scouting but can we please not draft a 5 9 receiver who runs a 4.4+ 40-time at 14?
I like players who played in cold weather stadiums     Mac is a warm weather QB
Why is this dude getting so much hype?
Damn, we have been lucky in the first round with talent falling into our lap with mid to late picks and I’m hoping he falls to us.
The pats could draft Zeus as their first round receiver and he would still bust, they’re cursed
God I hope he falls to us if we don’t get Bijan
sorry lil bro JSN is ours
Drafting a good wr high in the draft?  Not possible
You know a WR is going to bomb when the Patriots draft them. Sorry Zay
Florio’s source is busy digging up other dirt.
Not for nothing but a buddy of mine works tarmac security at Logan and he snapped [this pic of Bill and another coach waiting for Zay to finish taxiing]( https://i.imgur.com/SuCWpUv.jpg)
Rumors out of the Shrine Bowl practices were that they are absolutely in love with the guy.   I'm obviously nervous about drafting another early receiver since the Patriots haven't demonstrated any ability to develop them.
They are 100% gunna pick a defensive player. I just can’t see Bill taking a WR that high.
They've been pretty skittish on early picks, which have been studs (Dugger and Strange) so I'm hoping they panic pick him at 14 as well.
thats the old way, the new way is to reach on a prospect that could be had in the later rounds because Bill is paranoid he won't get HIS guy.
You might miss out on a real wideout but you can at least take solace that one of those late round picks will end up being a pro bowl corner for some reason.
This is the NFL's best kept secret when it comes to comp picks, I wish my favorite teams did this.
As is tradition
He’s the best reciever in NE rn /s
Wait there is a meme? I was in Boston for work a month ago or so
Especially if they draft Stroud
Definitely thinking Texans take a qb and wr at 2 and 12
I still think JSN is WR1 of this class. I think his injury issues are overexaggerated and that like (Garrett) Wilson and Olave he'll be a Day 1 Plug n'Play.  Flowers could very well be a WR2 in this class.
I got to see him play in person against Louisville with my dad and we were both blown away by him. Really hope he falls to our pick I would be stoked to have him since JSN will probably be off the board by then.  I believe if he transferred to another school he would be the top receiver in the class. BC was god awful.
It’s between him and JSN imo
No chance the Pats draft the best WR
Yeah but it's us so he'll prob be a bust
If he played somewhere else, like literally anywhere else, he would probably be touted as the top WR prospect
Besides who we take in round 3 or up, so second best ain't bad...
IDK, think the Bears have a chance to go WR, if they don't take Robinson.  Texans also are mocked up to take a WR at 12.  Some believe Pats go cornerback.
Ryan, Kuechly, Simmons, Landry, Dillon, Raji, Castonzo… the only bust we’ve had recently was Cherilus
I’ve been thinking Jack Campbell from Iowa seems like a perfect Bill Belichick reach player
Well, 21 is our pick and unless some chicanery happens we won't be trading up. If anything we are going to trade down because of our cap situation. We need them cheapie players lol
He’s pretty short lol
JSN is definitely head and shoulders the best WR in this draft both literally in this case  and figuratively. Flowers is awesome but drafting a 5'9" 4 year receiver from BC at #14 overall is preposterous
JSN won't be there at 20-25.  Even Zay Flowers would be iffy at that point.
Agreed, unless one of the top tackles are still available at 14. Less sexy for sure, but it could be massive for the line to grab Jones or Skoronski (Johnson won’t be available at 14 I feel)
My dream is a swap with the Bucs that includes Evans but I know I need to be reasonable here.
Jsn will be gone shortly after we pick in the teens if he's even there at all. I think Zay is doable at low 20s but if you like a guy I think you just take them when you pick. We have a ton of picks this year already, I'd be fine not grabbing any more and using some for trade ups to sweeten mid round deals.
You travel to work on plane?!
Jordan Addison, come on down!
lmao no it's not
Wait, that's not the pic I was [expecting](http://i.imgur.com/MNPO04z.gif)...
90s mens' business fashion was something else. Those pant legs could fit an elephant.
It’s crazy how we could develop guys like Jules and Welker yet all our early round WRs end up as busts.
>the  BOB had a history of falling in love with players in all-star games for the texans. pretty much none of them turned out any good
The Patriots don't draft early receivers. In the last almost 20 years, the list of WR drafted in the top 3 rounds is Chad Jackson, Aaron Dobson, and N'Keal Harry. That's the whole list. Yes, all flopped terribly. But a large reason they have no early round WR hits is because they just don't draft early round WR. Remember Bethel Johnson? That was friggen 2003!  Edit to add: Also Tyquan Thornton last year but the jury is out in large part due to injury and also whatever the heck Matt Patricia and Joe Judge were doing last year (dumping it off to the RBs), so I omitted him.
Got to tell you bud... I saw this and my immediate thought was "I guess zay is going to bust then".
I could honestly see us trading back and taking one of the WRs that fall to us. Pretty sure we’ve had most of the 1st round WRs this class on visits already.   Regardless our track record of WR draft choices is… less than good, so I’m going into the idea of taking a WR is a skeptical optimism.  I’d hope we could snag a good tackle at 14, and have a feeling at least one of Johnson , Skoronski or Jones will be available there.   Unless some top 10 projected guy falls to us on the defensive side, I’m not too keen on taking any of them. Wouldn’t be terribly upset with Witherspoon (Think he will be better than Porter but what do I know) , or Brian Branch.  We just have clear glaring holes on the offensive end but knowing bill, yeah we will trade back and take someone we could have gotten with 2.14…
It’ll be interesting given the QB run in the top 11 picks. A guy like Witherspoon could def fall. Or on of the top OTs.
Which is unfortunate because the random assortment of 5th-7th rounders are typically better than HIS guy
My favorite is when people say the Mac Jones pick was a collaboration between ownership and Bill.  But then the following year we draft Cole strange In the first? So was it a collaboration for just 1 year lmao.
Oh here we go again. Let me guess, you're referring to Strange? Who very possibly would not have made it back to New England considering, you know, multiple guards were drafted in the 2nd round? You have absolutely zero idea who would've been available and when.  Every "analyst" had Nakobe Dean as a first round lock, first LB off the board, first whatever. He went in the third. And there are countless examples of the media getting their mock drafts and predictions wrong. The media, barring very few people, know no more than we do sitting on our couches.
Tank Dell at 14 incoming
I though Patricia didn’t have much influence in their org. This sounds JUST like him and Quinn
Seems to be the right thing for him to do.  Look at last draft, he takes an average guard in the first, a probable bust WR in the second, and in then in the third and fourths takes two starting CB's and a quarterback who looks like could potentially shape up into a starter
>thats the old way, the new way is to reach on a prospect that could be had in the later rounds because Bill is paranoid he won't get HIS guy.  Both of those approaches are old tbh; Bill trades back in the 1st round, and then takes chances in the 2nd.  It's been a sporadic combination of the two since (at least) the anomaly that was 2006.  Back then I thought it was brilliant getting Laurence Maroney in the 1st and Chad Jackson in the 2nd round!!!  It didn't quite work out the way I'd hoped though lol.  After that Bill started getting a little too cute I guess.   Just a reminder to illustrate my point: Tavon Wilson was drafted in the 2nd round in 2012... that didn't work out.  One that worked? Gronkowski fresh off of back surgery, drafted in the 2nd round in 2010.  Bill does things the way he wants. A positive for that is, most times, over the last 20+ years, he's proven himself right. A negative is that when he misses, he **misses**... BAD.  It comes with the territory I guess.
dudes really smooth and has huge playmaking ability as evidence by his Rose Bowl performance. I think he’s got a ton of CD Lamb similarities and he’s gonna go lower this year due to that injury. I’m with you that he’s WR1 in this class, albeit not a strong class overall at the position
Imagine if Texans gets CJ Stroud and JSN. College teammates who immediately gel and get to work together in a new offense
No way Bijan goes that high to the bears. Rbs just aren't worth the high picks.  Bears have a lot of needs in the trenches. I think they go o-line.   I could see the eagles going for him with one of their picks, if he goes that high, because they're pretty stacked and drafting twice in the first.
god damn I remember Kuechly dragging that team kicking and screaming. What a player, was always a big fan and wish he got to bring home the Lombardi..
BC big boys are good
True. He is the same height as Steve Smith for comparison. To me, I feel like he'd benefit a lot from a little bulking up as much as anything, Smith for instance was nearly 200lbs, Flowers weighed in barely over 180 at the combine.
but have you ever thought of   H O M E G R O W N    T A L E N T
Same height as waddle and tyreek
They'd both probably be slight reaches at 20. They're both mid - late 20s guys.
Welker had three years in the league before he was traded to the Pats
I’ll defend Malcom Mitchell till I die
Well I mean, you've only picked 3 early WRs in the past like 15 years, and they were all **massive** reaches. Think it has little to do with talent development and a lot more with whomever was evaluating these guys.   Flowers, at the least, everyone seems to think is actually talented enough to be a first round pick
Tyquan showed more flashes last season than Nkeal has his entire career. I don't think he will be a star by any means but a solid wr 3 with low end wr 2 upside potentially.
I agree. I can see you guys grabbing someone later like Cedric Tillman, Josh Downs, Marvin Mims Jr, etc.  I think Brian Branch would be a good pick up for you guys as well.
Cole Strange was seemingly “his guy” and he looks to be working out. Kyle Dugger was “his guy” that everyone was up in arms about and he has definitely worked out.
When’s the last time one of Bills early round picks was a bullseye? I don’t follow the Pats too hard unless they’re in the SB lmao
Just because you own a restaurant doesn't mean you're a good cook.
Realistically I’m sure Kraft hears all the debates for players and defers to bills expertise. There’s probably some picks he loves and some he doesn’t but he trusts the gm
You don't think the owner would take more of an interest in the process of drafting his team's starting QB for at least the next 3 seasons vs when they're just looking to build the roster up?
Kraft could have totally exerted his power for only one year to make sure  Bill drafted a true QB successor after the Cam Newton year. Not sure what your point is.
Mock drafts provide a great deal of fun and are useful in providing the average fan information on players. The worst part is everyone assumes those mock drafts are somehow identical to what teams have on their board and give people the delusion that they somehow know more than an NFL GM
I’ll never forget all the media bashing BB got for drafting Darius Butler in the second round. And yet if you looked at the mock drafts for that year, the media had him going to the Pats in the first…
I mean, have you seen how bad our WR depth is after Doubs? That's why I've been pining us to take JSN this year, even if it means trading up to snag him.
Or as I like to call it the "Burrow-Chase Theory".
That would be an insane turnaround for going from Cooks and Deshaun to this
You can check the mock up on [NFL.com](https://NFL.com) , not my mock up.  Seen some comments about him saying he's a generational talent.
Yes but SSS is a rarity among WRs.  Most 5 9 WRs aren’t doing what he did
a lot slower and lighter too.
>They're both mid - late 20s guys.  According to who?   No offense, but this is wishful thinking.  JSN's probably going top 15 with wr needy times like the titans and texans - There's a very real chance he isn't there for the pats at 14, let alone at picks 20-25.    Flowers I wouldn't be shocked if he gets picked in the 20-25 range, but I also wouldn't be shocked if he went in the 15-20 range either.  It's all a crap shoot, and depends on everyone's tolerance for risk given his size.
I don't see him going much lower than 22. I would bet my ball sack that he goes first round.
He's not getting past the Chargers and Ravens at #21/22, but you could argue you get replaceable value taking Josh Downs or Tank Dell at #46
He was the man, but he was only available because he had no knees.  Which was true
Harry wasn't a massive reach at all. A lot of people had him as the wr1 in the draft that year.
I'm holding out a little more hope. He's taller/heavier than Devonta Smith, for example, with elite speed and even more elite quickness, and supposedly has a pretty complete package. Idk what that means in New England, but I wouldn't be shocked for a high-end WR2 season with BOB if he can stay healthy. And I had to delete "low-end WR1" lol.
I think Branch is a sleeper pick for us at 14. He seems like the prototypical Patriots pick lol.   Very versatile, played all over the defense in college. Patriots would be able to find where he would be most successful I think. Problem is we already have a lot of those guys in our secondary honestly. Between Dugger, Peppers and Phillips, we have a lot of safeties that move all around the defense.
We are *clearly* drafting Charlie Jones.
AT Perry seems like a Patriot to me. I could see them double dipping tbh
Same for Devin McCourtey. When he was drafted the media proclaimed that he wasted a first on a special teamer
But the narrative people like to push!
A guard who got benched for performance 3 separate times seems to be working out as a 1st rounder? And nobody ever complained about Dugger because he wasn't overdrafted...
The trade down for cole strange also netted us Marcus jones and zappe, who directly won 3 games for us last season
Dugger and Barmore have both been very good for second rounders, granted Barmore has been hurt and hasn't exactly showed out on the stat sheet. Our last good first was probably Hightower though and he and Shaq are the last draft picks we've given a second contract to
I'd say the worst part is when fans see the mock drafts as more valid than teams drafting. Like why is Mel Kipers opinion of where a player should be drafted more valuable than an actual team drafting him?
Signs are pointing to him potentially going to Chicago. He's one of only like 5 prospects that the Bears have met twice
I’ve seen many mocks with GB taking a TE. I have Watson and want JSN so I hope he lands somewhere else.
That theory is why, when the Lions were struggling, I was a proponent of going up for Young to reunite him with Jamo.
yea, thats definitely the call... hes one of the biggest talents in the draft, but rbs are so devalued now.  I definitely think he goes first round, but I think its like late first to one of the 'contenders' like Buffalo or something unless the eagles get wild with that NO pick.
Doesn’t matter if he’s generational at rb. The rest of the offense matters a lot to a rbs succesz  It’s probably no other rb as talented as Saquan in terms of size, speed, and skill but that Giants team sucks on offense.
It's a weak WR class and there are more good players than available picks. For JSN and Flowers to both be gone, something weird would need to happen.   Like every non- QB/DL/CB/OT pick in the top 20 would need to be a WR to have them both not be there.
I would also bet this guy's balls
He literally had 70 catches as the third option in the 2006 Dolphins’ offense, but okay.
I don't think he was a "reach" but he was certainly pretty far from the perceived WR1. Every report I read at the time said he was the most "pro-ready" but NOT the best prospect. Don't think he was the WR1.
Yeah actually you're right, most outlets had him high. I just had him as like WR12 so I'm letting my own thoughts cloud that a bit.
Comparing him to Devonta is a bad comp. Devanta is an elite route runner and catches everything.  Thornton has some potential physically but as a wr it’s tbd
You’ll get Van Ness and you’ll like it
A rookie who started every game with 94% of snaps, 5 total penalties and got “benched 3 times” in his rookie year, yea I will take that.
In his defense, he was in possibly the worst situation for a rookie offensive lineman to be in.  Matt Patricia was his offensive line coach. I could honestly just stop there.   But also, his center missed time. His QB missed time. His LT was often a liability. They had a new OC (also Matt Patricia, go figure) who tried to install an offense that that team hadn't executed before, so he was a newbie learning a new system among *other* players *also* learning a new system. Not exactly a recipe for success without any stability in the offense.

Bro Cole was actually really good this year wtf lol. He is incredibly promising
People are sooooo salty when you point out Strange was an awful pick from both a talent and process perspective.
Hightowers got some wild highlights for sure. Thanks for this man. Definitely interested to see how y’all’s division shakes up this year, gonna be a tight race!
Sounds like Baudrillard's [second order of simulacra](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulacra_and_Simulation)
Didn't you guys just trade for Claypool and DJ Moore? As it stands, your trenches on both sides could use some serious reinforcements.
I don’t think anything necessarily weird would have to happen.   If Houston selects Stroud, I feel it would be rather expected for them to grab JSN at 12, if available.  Titans are WR needy, and select 11th. Packers at 15 don’t have an amazing receiver room either, after Doubs in the depth chart it ain’t pretty. Ravens could go receiver at 22 , Same for Vikings at 23.  There are plenty of WR needy teams, and it being a weak class does not mean teams won’t address needs. It’s a dangerous game playing the trade back game for one of these WRs imo. If they think one of them is the guy I’d prefer they just grab him at 14 than risk fucking it up.
Since I looked it up...  He had 67 catches for 687 yards that year, 29 for 434 the year before that, then his first year in New England, 112 catches for 1175 yards.  More yards and more catches in '07 with NE than his first two years combined. Definitely not just a punt returner, though.
Maybe not wr1 but I just found 3 different pre draft rankings that all had him ranked 2nd in the class. He was generally considered part of the elite group in the class.
Naw, he was definitely perceived as a solid prospect too. Guy could JUMP , and had good hands in college IIRC. Showed freak ability in college tape, but none of it translated to the NFL.  Really didn’t pan out. Could never get separation, hands were never good enough to justify throwing a lot of lobs to.  All that aside to say he was a reach is revisionist history. He was regarded as one of the safest WR choices that draft, and was within the top 3 rated after the combine. We all know how that worked out, and the patriots have reached on plenty of other guys. Harry just wasn’t one of them.
Not at any point. AJ and Hollywood were the two top receivers for a long time until DK’s combine performance. Most places seem to have JJAW above him, too.
The comp was solely size because many people think Thornton is too small/frail to be a consistent producer.
Please no
Lmfao what..? If you bench a player 3 times that means they started very game out of pure necessity. He looked like he'll be an okay player for a stretch to end the year but if you throw a FRP at a guard and they're not elite you threw the pick in the garbage. I find it hard to believe you think a first round guard project is a real thing.
Strange sucks, dude. It's time to stop pretending everything Bill touches turns to gold.
Yeah I agree. I'm not saying he's not going to be good but to say he already is a good pick or that he's even somewhat "working out great" is patently ridiculous. He was flat out awful for chunks of the season and to say that since Patricia was in charge it doesn't count and he must be great makes 0 sense.   Like most people, I fundamentally disagree with drafting a guard in the first, but that's a whole different conversation. My initial take when the pick was made was that we overdrafted him by 2 rounds but if Bill wanted a guard in the first I'd just assume he's an all-pro. Problem is a top guard, if that's what he becomes, is still just flat out not a difference maker.
The only rationale I think holds any weight is that "Strange 69" is an objectively elite jersey purchase
My thoughts here are that Claypool and Mooney are both up for extensions after this year. Drafting JSN would let us look solid for 2024 and 2025 even if we don't bring either of those two back  Also, I think our offense, moreso than others, needs to create mismatches downfield. Fields requires an extra defender at all times because of his home run ability on the ground. If we can bring the number of receiving weapons who require extra help (right now just Moore) from one to two, we can pretty much guarantee someone is always open. You can't spy Fields and double-cover two receivers without creating serious defensive holes somewhere else
wow I wonder what changed, must have entirely been the famous New England WR development program and not anything else
Yes iirc he was considered a good prospect. Don't agree with the assessment he was a "massive" reach considering pre-draft stuff is just opinion of media folks. But don't think he was the best either
So we are in agreement then.
For me it’s more he’s very unpolished but hey if he can’t catch at least 10 or more deep throws a year it doesn’t matter.
why do fans constantly do this where they think because you’re a first round pick you have to be an elite talent the minute you take a snap?!  Bellicheck stated in his presser that they had him graded day 2 but took him since they’re wasn’t anyone else on there board they didn’t like?   Yeah sure the guy got benched 3 times we took a center to play guard everyone bitched about and then the guy year 3 was our best linemen LOL. Oline takes a while to adjust to nfl level play.
Ok
How can you say that? Objectively his production was average. As a rookie that’s not something that happens at guard. He started all 17 games. AS A ROOKIE. I don’t think you are understanding that…  Edit: According to PFF our rookies were rated 9th best out of 32 teams last year statistically.   https://www.nj.com/giants/2023/04/nfl-draft-analysis-jets-giants-selected-well-last-season-eagles-got-little-from-rookie-class.html?outputType=amp
“Looks to be working out” not “working out great” the word jumbling is patently ridiculous when the line I typed is just a few comments above.
>Problem is a top guard, if that's what he becomes, is still just flat out not a difference maker.  The Chiefs just won a Super Bowl on the back of elite IOL play protecting Mahomes and establishing a good run game.  The Bengals two years ago lost a Super Bowl due to poor IOL play allowing Aaron Donald to run rampant.  While some positions on OL are more important than others, even the least important position can still be a difference maker.  Now, you can say it's easier to find good guards later in the draft compared to, say, WR or CB, which is valid, but it's incorrect to say a guard can't be a difference maker. We've seen enough shit offensive lines to know how important every position on the line is.  I still think New England should've paid Karras given his very affordable contract, thus not needing Strange in the first place, but if Strange ends up a top-tier guard as soon as this upcoming season, I won't be upset about it. BOB and Klemm are monumental upgrades compared to Matt Patricia and Judge.
You still need time to throw though. Skill positions mean zilch if you can't stop the opposing rush. It also exposes your QB to more hits. Just ask Miami how that is going for them.
Ignore the fact that Tom Brady was at the helm, and that *any* slot receiver under Brady **immediately** became a household name (to NFL fans at least).  That said, Welker was BY FAR the best of them... for a reason. The man was a supreme talent before Manning turned his brain to mud.
I absolutely meant to reply to someone else LMAO, hats off to you fine gentleman for having such a great opinion
It's no coincidence that his streak of poor play also coincided with when our veteran center was injured.
>why do fans constantly do this where they think because you’re a first round pick you have to be an elite talent the minute you take a snap?!  Because at guard/rb/any other extremely replaceable, low value position, that is largely the case. If you're picking a position that largely does not matter in the first round and they're not an elite player you wasted capital on something that's readily available and inexpensive through other avenues.   >Bellicheck stated in his presser that they had him graded day 2 but took him since they’re wasn’t anyone else on there board they didn’t like?   Source   >Yeah sure the guy got benched 3 times we took a center to play guard everyone bitched about and then the guy year 3 was our best linemen LOL. Oline takes a while to adjust to nfl level play.  I'm not even sure you're replying to the right comment chain at this point. He said the pick is working out great. I said that's obviously not true because they benched him in 3 separate games for being not good at the sport. That doesn't mean he can't pan out, it means saying he already did is patently incorrect.
Remove the word great and you're still wrong lmfao
It’s funny how people act like having a good OL isn’t a huge deal. Kinda reminds me of how our fans were like “you can’t blow a bunch of money on Thuney!” and then Reid, arguably the leagues best offensive mind, was like “take my money!”
Haha no worries. I was confused by your use of the word "naw" then proceeding to agree with me. I didn't think he was the best, and certainly if you didn't like him that's fair, but I would not describe him as a massive reach
it’s just really annoying to me when fans are like “omg we took this guy first round he better be fucking elite all pro year 1” and when he isn’t they get super mad and say he sucks because he had one or two bad years of production.   They never take into context needs, strength of draft class, team boards, why the team made the move they made etc etc.   It’s going to be so funny when this this draft 2023 plays. They’re isn’t that many blue chip talents in it, a lot of great starting caliber guys and some potentially elite. a lot of crying about to happen in this draft also
low value pick?! you think guards are low value?! 😂😂😂😂😂
“Looks to be working out” not “working out great” the word jumbling is patently ridiculous when the line I typed is just a few comments above.
“I don’t take into account shit” what a legend
“They won’t even bring him to camp, shit, he looks like the star of the day for the saints”   So many quotable lines in this, dude is the undisputed press conference GOAT
Imagine this was your boss lol
This rant is low-key way funnier than the playoffs one
Hey u/nfl, any chance you can create a throwback compilation of Jim Mora rants? No way there isn’t enough of them to fill out at least 15-20 minutes
If you don’t love Jim Mora, you just don’t love football
I miss when coach kept it real instead of the PR answers we have now.
One of my earliest memories is of a Saints watching party at my family's house. I was probably like 4 or 5, early 90s. Saints won. Mora was happy. My mom shouts, "Y'all, Jim Mora is smiling!" and everyone comes running in to see this stunning, unprecedented image.
Scrimmage? Scrimmage?
 This is the best Mora rant.
Jim Mora's rants are so great because they're not Bob-Knight-style fury, but rather some of the purest self-loathing and pessimism you'll ever hear. He's like a higher-energy expression of that "I don't want to be around anymore" line from I Think You Should Leave.
You don't tug on superman's cape  You don't spit into the wind  You don't pull the mask off the old lone ranger  And you don't ~~mess around~~ mention the playoffs to Jim.
Jim Mora is the realest motherfucker
Can someone give the younger fans context? What year is this, how did the saints and chiefs do that year, etc?  Edit: [found it on YouTube](https://youtu.be/Gn99zFRqyDk), top comment says it was a 1992 scrimmage and that the saints ended up going 12-4 that year  Edit: I just watched more Jim Mora and I swear this dude's vocabulary is just "shit", "sick", "suck", "stunk", and "stupid",
The best part is that the "playoffs?!" rant is probably the least golden of Mora's rants.  My absolute favorite clip of him is when he [goes off on a reporter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWTuOriuN6o) for asking if the fact that the upcoming game had no playoff implications affected anything. The end where he turns back to give his thoughts three different times is straight up "oh, and ANOTHER THING" during a heated debate with a significant other and makes me laugh every time.
"Do we have anybody who CAN practice"  LMAO  I need to believe that Jimmy Butler has also made this quote
He’s a treasure. And his pressers are up there with the best of all time.
Jim Mora, the king of positive psychology
#legend
God he gave such good interviews lmao. Will never forget the one right before he got fired on the saints.  Hes like halfway through the door and just starts immediately: “WELL WHAT HAPPENED BOYS? That second game we got OUR ASS KICKED”
Paper bag Aints
Laughing my ass off at this bro.
Okay, but do you think youse can make the playoffs?
KC cut him, he's a star to us
This is as close as you’re gonna get to a HC shitting on his own guy lol.
The "star of the day" line always gets me... It wasn't as funny at the time though
Gotta love a straight shooter lol
SHIT, Star of the day for the Saints. Haha. I remember him when I was younger but too young to appreciate these gems.
The following link is my favorite Mora moment, and it's as true for the fans as it is for the media. Not easy to hear, but the truth just the same:  https://youtu.be/NHipzGL4dwM
Jim Mora. Saints legend.
I feel like the coach in Not Another Teen Movie is based on Jim Mora.
Big Easy Bloopers sounds like a niche porn fetish site
Best coach interviewee in NFL history.  PLAYOFFS?!?!?!
It almost feels like a skit but it’s not. Was laughing throughout.
“But did you take into account…“  “I don’t take into account shit. They kicked our ass. That’s what I take into account.”
Imagine a coach keeping it real like this in the modern social media age. 90 % of his players would be demanding trades cause their feelings got hurt.
Jim Mora was a real one
Love me some Jim Mora
Jim Mora could always be counted on to say what he thought.
Horseshit.
He's always been a youtube clip machine. "Playoffs?, you're talkin playoffs?"
I miss old school coaches
"Had a guy blow a nut...knee"
Goddamn, I miss these types of real ass pressers. Fuck all that company man shit, I wanna know how you really feel. Let it loose, Coach
Jim Mora: bad coach, great highlight reels
It’s the fucking king of the sound byte, his rant about meaningless games is even better  https://youtu.be/rTrmvF2TLgw
This is how I wish more coaches talked.   Honesty and letting them know it was a terrible game.   Instead of the praising everybody which is disingenuous.
Man professional sports were awesome when they did take the narrative by the throat and strangled the life out of the game
Man this is golden.  Those Aints teams were so bad.
Saints at their most tolerable
“Playoffs??!!!”
“WE GOT GUYS…”
How have I never seen this. This guy is a gold mine of angry quotes
What a legend
Playoffs?!
I always liked his honesty.
Now that's a football guy
What year was this and what was the saints record that year?
Inspiring leadership there. I’m sure all the junior varsity players are motivated by that speech. /s
Playoffs?
"oh shit"
Absolutely comedy , I miss coaches like Mora  Classic
Playoffs? You're talking about playoffs?
I miss WI being the Cheddar League for training camps.
Now THIS should be under r/oldschoolcool!
Jw, what team were they scrimmaging against?
Lee Elia did it better  https://youtu.be/B2pai2QQA54
I went to high school with Tommy Stowers. Tommy was the best player on our high school team (Hickman Mills, Kansas City, which doesn’t exist anymore) as a freshman. If you’d seen him play and how his college and pro career went, you’d be utterly astonished at how superhuman most pro football players are.
Playoffs is better
"and we got a back that gets his nut-knee blown out" xD
The exact opposite of belichick
I feel like Bill Belichick could have used some of these colorful comments last year.
Anyone know what year this was from and how the saints did that year?
Good thing no one asked him about the playoffs.
Playoffs?? Playoffs?!? Don't talk about playoffs! I'm just trying to win a game!!
Semper Fi
Shit I don't know if that's effort or not
Sounds like something a Tim Robinson character would yell
Came to say the same thing… f-ing legend.  I don’t take into account shit.  I have to remember when my life isn’t like other people’s lives and it all stinks, think mora.
https://i.imgur.com/SyQ7LUr.jpg
Except horseshit, "horseshit ball carrying" to be exact.
"I dont take into account diddly-poo"
Tell us what u really think Jim
I am exclusively calling fumbles “horse shit ball carrying” from now on lol
He’s great but McKay would like a word.
“You’re so shitty that the other company didn’t want you, and we’re so shitty that you’re the best we’ve got”   Uh, thanks Boss 🥴
Atleast he’s straight up, I’d like working for him
He sounds like my dad.
I wish someone had the balls to ask him at what point does he have to start blaming his team’s incompetence on himself, being the boss?    “Well I’m a horse shit coach I’ll tell you that. Can’t play call for shit, can game plan for shit, just a sorry excuse for a head coach.”
I just sent this to my team because this is literally me when I lose a deal lolllll  But like - I’m not going to sugar coat it. We STUNK
This is what most coaches back in those days were like, & what a lot of then still are like behind closed doors.
And diddly poo is the best of them all
I love a good sports rant. That’s why I love Mad Dog Russo. He definitely gives us some great rants.
playoffs one is like iverson practice, so good
"What do you think of your team's execution?"  "I'm in favor of it."  Love some John McKay as well.
None of that dick-tugging, smile-for-the-camera bullshit.
For what it’s worth, he coached the Philadelphia/Baltimore Stars to all three USFL Championship games and won two of them.
I wish all coaches would just be real. Need more of this from the entire league.
i know you gonna hate this one but arthur smith doesnt give the media shit
Unrelated to NFL, but that is why I love Micah Shrewsberry, the Penn State men’s basketball coach. That dude is refreshing as shit. He keeps it real and pulls 0 punches. He’s awesome at press conferences
Closest thing we've seen recently was Joe Judge's infamous "clown show" rant. I didn't like that he threw Pat Shurmur under the bus but part of me respects that he was fighting like hell to keep his job.
I just hope we make it through a regular season game.
Man, we talking about scrimmage. Not a game, not a game, *scrimmage*
[My favorite is still "Didly Poo" because he wasn't even asked a question to set him off. He just walked up to the podium and went "well what happened was..." lol](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Tie0tz7jGDI)
But for real.  Hes not some maniac, hes not frothing at the mouth, hes completely coherent, he just doesnt mince words, at all.  Its refreshing.
He definitely had a few Bob Knight style rants where he went off on the media, but when he was talking about his own team he was always pessimistically retrospective in the best ways
Iirc we fell apart the following year in 1993 after a 5-0 start. By then, the team was past its prime, and the Dome Patrol was broken up the previous off-season after we traded Pat Swilling for the pick we used to draft Willie Roaf.    In retrospect, trading away our DPOY OLB for a HOF LT was a great move.  Seems like the kinda move that would set up a franchise for years of success, right?
Had maybe the best lb group of all time
The Five S's
Sounds like a South Park Tourette’s episode
That was **GLORIOUS** I've never seen it before, thanks!
Lmao the reporter is even dropping fucks at the end.
>the "playoffs?!" rant is probably the least golden of Mora's rants  For me it was the high-pitched tone of "Playoffs" that puts it up there.  Like the Howard Dean "Hyahhh" it's the pure crazy unhinged sound rather than the content.
The anti-Tony Robins.
He didn’t get fired, he unleashed that rant and then he quit. Halfway through the season. Even as a Saints fan I found that hilarious.
This is the guy that got them to remove the bags....those Pat Swilling/IronHead Heyward teams were legit.
They went 12-4 that season lol
Lmao you got me to go YouTube those scenes. Giggling like a lil school girl now - that guy was so great
Jim Mora wasn't a very good coach. 😆😆  The players would leave because they actually wanted to win something.
You take that back about the USFL’s Lombardi.
That clip was bleeping useless!
tf does that mean
The year this clip was taken the Saints went 12-4.

It’s horseshit ball carrying, I know that.
I think I know exactly which sketch (coffins) you’re referring to
I didn’t do fucking shit.
At first I read this as Tony Robins.  Maybe people need a Jim Mora seminar.
Adding it to my anti-anxiety mantras.
McKay?
Reading your comment really put it into perspective and I'm laughing even harder now.
That's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me.
Is this the year he quit right in the middle of the season because the team was so ass.
This is always my memory of Mora. Like, yeah these rants are funny retrospectively but back then it mostly felt like deflection. You're the damned coach Jim, [look inward](https://i.imgur.com/qNVMnnz.jpg).
The best part is the reporter didn’t even ask a question at that point he just starts going in
"We couldn't make a first down, we couldn't run the ball, we didn't try to run the ball, we couldn't complete a pass... we sucked."  Is the best line I've ever heard a coach say followed closely by "I'm totally embarrassed and totally ashamed."
Absolutely, although I like this one because the way he talks to the reporters is the same way you’d talk with your coworkers on a blue-collar lunch break.
"Three or four plane crashes and we're in the playoffs."
Posting his quotes is cheating, honestly. An absolute hot take machine.
He would have thrived in the Twitter era.
It’s not worth it is the problem. You do this now and it’s international news and every word is broken down within 15 seconds by 829 different media sources and fans online. It’s so much easier to put your head down and stick to the script now. The internet sterilized and neutered the league, and everything else for that matter.
From the entire world. I'm quite bored of everyone being a corporate suckass.
Everyone says that until it actually happens. People complained that Arians criticized his own players too much
Bobby Hebert also left the team in FA in 93 so they  ended up starting Wade Wilson who kinda sucked
The Dome Patrol! Pretty damn good argument. 3 All-Pro players and another pro-bowler that year.   You got them, the Parcells Giants group, and maybe the 1970s Steelers and 85 Bears.   In my opinion it’s the Dome Patrol and Giants competing for the top spot, only because LT was so dominant. There’s never been a more complete linebacking core than what the Saints had. Probably gotta give the edge to the Saints here. Just an incredible 4 man unit. So much talent.
Those were great teams
He was a great coach. Gave the Saints their first winning season in franchise history and led them to the playoffs four times(although they never won).
I would like to file yourself
just means coaches could say whatever they wanted instead of this placid, plastic response that the current era is adopting. When is the laat time you’ve heard something meaningful from a coach?  Mora was at least candid and honest about he felt. More personality, probably demoralizing to play for but hey fun for fans
Chiefs fan comes in and gets karma for posting a quote from the video. What's that tell ya?
Horseshit
Or how about you're a player who got cut but picked up by another team and you hear what sounds like a compliment and then Coach says "yeah he got cut by another team and now is on our garbage squad so sure he looked great, yeah" lol
You have to look him up and then be prepared to laugh your head off.  Three quick quotes I got from Googling him but trust me there is a lot more you can easily find.  John McKay was HC for the expansion Bucs.  1 - "The (orange) uniforms were already picked out by the time I got here. I didn't give it too much thought until I saw our buses and I said, \`My God, we're dressed just like that bus.' " -- on the Bucs uniforms  2 - "Injuries kill you. I remember in Pittsburgh, we had no players and the ones we did have wanted to stay at the hotel by the fire. I was ticked because that's where I wanted to stand." -- on the Buccaneers losing 42-0 to the Steelers  3 - "We didn't tackle well today but we made up for it by not blocking."  &#x200B;  [link](http://www.espn.com/classic/obit/s/2001/0517/1200798.html) <--- I'm sure there is other quotes elsewhere
Can’t be. Buford Jordan was early 90s. He’s in a madden I played a little lol
*pops into frame*   SO WHAT HAPPENED WAS #@&$&#&#:¢%"@"#'@£€€©
The reporters didn't ask diddly poo
"We didn't tackle well today but we made up for it by not blocking."
Holy fuck 🤣
Fair point. I'm not a huge social media user so I often don't think about that aspect.
“I need to watch the tape”.
> The internet sterilized...  The internet did not. I would argue it move with Google, Microsoft, Facebook, et al. having the vast control of the internet did. Big Tech want everyone to be a grey blob on their platforms so they can get everyone on them. Can have some asshole calling people out. It will scare away users therefore less eyeballs. The platforms must be a warm, safe space.
Me too. Everyone thing people like Musk are their friend when those people would easily kill them if they thought it would bring a profit.
Shoulda beaten the Eagles to advance in the play-offs that year, Randall Cunningham pulled a victory from the jaws of defeat.
Head coach for nearly 15 years and never won a playoff game? Can't be that good.   Hell he'd argue with you if you even asked about it😆😆
That karma is horseshit?
Shit I don't know if that's effort or not.
It tells Bears fans that you shoulda drafted Mahomes.     Feel better now?
Talk about damning with faint praise. I would be devastated if I was that player. Savage
"How'd you like your players execution today?"    "I'm all for it"
Then he left the Saints and refused to elaborate
All time favorite quote, I shoehorn this into other non football related conversations.
You best start believing in social media, u/Imaginary-Yesterday7, you’re in one! 🏴‍☠️
You're on Reddit. This sub does exactly what they explained above.
Yes yes we do hear that a lot
Last time I checked Facebook is the internet.
Big Tech isn't the reason. It's 100,000,000 eyes on you at all times judging your actions. Do you really think coaches want to fire up twitter and see "fans" raging about the phrasing of the latest press conference?
Lol those things are all “the internet”. What the hell
And nothing has changed 30 years later
What's that say about our thread?
No need to
I loved Geoffrey Rush in Tampa Bay Buccaneers
Meh, reddit is not quite FB or Twitter....
Yes, because Big Tech is set up to be that way. That want eye balls on everything at all times so they can put ads between your eye balls and thing you are interested in.      Big Tech were the primary drivers of it and it is how Google makes the vast majority of its money.
No, they are companies on the internet. Very very large over sized presence, but they aren't the internet. They want to be tho.  They would not let sites like 4chan and its variants live if they were the internet. It is why Trump was still able to launch a social network.  Big Tech controls 95% of the internet, but not all. Woe be the day they do.
Some things have changed: y'all 1. have a Lombardi trophy, and, 2. are no longer a league wide punchline
We are horseshit?
Lmao
The default subs are dumber than most social media and not nearly as funny as twitter or ig
> 2. are no longer a league wide punchline  You can thank the Falcons for that
Keep an eye out for Eagles fans.  Just sayin.
I think Drew Brees and Sean Payton have more to do with it than any other franchise. The league always has punchline teams….but the Saints ain’t been the Aints in so long, people don’t know they used to be called the Aints.
No because:  1. The NFL wants drama and intrigue for the draft and not announcing the 1st pick ahead of time creates that. It's also why The 1st pick takes the whole clock up despite already knowing who they're taking  2. The rookie wage scale mostly eliminates the need to negotiate contracts ahead of time.
In 2006, the Texans signed Mario Williams 1 or 2 nights before the draft.  In 2008, the Dolphins signed Jake Long 5 days before the draft.  Sandwiched between that? The Raiders didn't get Jamarcus signed until Week 2 of the regular season lmao.
Probably not. What are the odds that Miami has the #1 pick and there being a Jake Long in the draft a 2nd time?
with rookie contracts 98% predetermined it seems fairly unlikely
Then they went from 1-15 to 11-5, one of the greatest turnarounds in history. Jake Long helped with that turnaround going to the Pro Bowl in his rookie season, as well the team going from Cleo Lemon at QB to Chad Pennington, and maybe the biggest reason was the Wild Cat offense catching the league off guard and helping the Dolphins in their turnaround. That was a magical year for the Dolphins.
15 years ago? You can't do that man. You can't just throw down a post like this and make some of us feel soooo incredibly old because that draft feels like 5 years ago.
Probably not
Probably not. This was before the rookie wage scale so oftentimes contract negotiations with top picks began weeks before the actual draft.   With set wages, negations now are pretty much only around offset language and a few other things so there's no need to start negotiating early.
2008 was FIFTEEN YEARS AGO?!?!?
Remember when the team picking first overall chose their pick based on who would give them a more team friendly deal in Fisher vs Joekel? And then the second pick ended up making more because he went to FL where there were no state taxes? That’s always a good process as well.
Didn’t like the pic for the dolphins, should’ve drafted Ryan and while he’s no Payton, Brady or Rodgers he’s better than every dolphins QB since Marino. Waste of the number 1 pick.
It happened a few times in the past but with the wage scale it isn't necessary anymore.  Plus the nfl would probably prohibit it anyway
We have a TV show to produce here, sir.
Im going with no. I believe the NFL will not allow it. Otherwise, we would have seen it when the Jags took TLaw.
signed signed
I don't even know if we'll have a team that flat out proclaims who the 1 pick is going to be before the draft again. League has probably asked they keep it behind closed doors so they can keep hype at a max.
in '91 the bears started negotiating contract with 3 players before the draft and actually came to terms with Mark Carrier. They drafted him 6th with a deal already in place. The NFL then changed the rules to prevent you from negotiating a contract with a player you had not yet drafted and only the #1 team could do any negotiating. Now with as big as the draft is on TV I think the NFL is discouraging this from happening.
To answer your question, no. Also, I still hate that pick lol
No. The NFL wants to make the draft a big media event. That's why we get so many dumb, "why are people saying this about x prospect" posts.
Brad Holmes got yelled at for turning in his picks too quickly. No way that happens again
I hope not, because I hate when it happens and ruins the draft a bit in my opinion. Plus with the rookie pay scale theres not really much reason to do so anymore
If they didn’t do it with TLaw I doubt it
They can’t
Signed signed
i wish they would go back to rookies being able to sign for as much $ as teams/player wanted!
The dolphins and negotiator negotiating contracts before they're supposed to. Better duo than Waddle/Hill
What’s the point? I really can’t see how that benefits anyone, at least not nowadays
It was super strange at the time, and I don't see this really happening again. Trades can develop overnight, and you never know when a certain team is going to overpay to jump into that top spot to ensure they get a specific player. If you have the top pick in the draft, you got that for a reason. Your team stinks and you have tons of holes all over the team, so if someone is offering you more picks, you need to at least weigh your options.
Stafford was signed before the draft too
Unless it’s a quaterback a star quaterback there is no reason to submit your draft pick that early. For a tackle, a team may get desperate and trde u a haul for a player they really like.  Ofc  Matt Ryan is a. Fringe hall of famer and Jake Long  was injury prone.
They signed a dragon
I'm curious as to the legality of them signing him to an NFL contract before drafting him. Is the entire world considered a free agent to the team that holds the #1 pick? Do they have temporary rights to every player who declared for the NFL draft?  If so, when does this period begin?
They didn't actually sign him before the draft, they just agreed to the terms
> It's also why The 1st pick takes the whole clock up despite already knowing who they're taking  The Lions supposedly got in trouble last year because they [submitted the pick for Hutchinson too fast](https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/2022-nfl-draft-the-nfl-apparently-got-mad-at-the-lions-during-the-first-round-and-it-was-for-this-reason/)
> The rookie wage scale mostly eliminates the need to negotiate contracts ahead of time.  I know it's better for teams, the game, and players as a whole, but part of me misses those crazy times.
> The NFL wants drama and intrigue for the draft and not announcing the 1st pick ahead of time creates that. It's also why The 1st pick takes the whole clock up despite already knowing who they're taking  To further illustrate: Prior to 2010, the Draft wasn't broadcast during primetime. Round 1 started on a Saturday afternoon and the whole thing was a 2-day slog. Now the first round is a premier event and is advertised as such.
I figured the full 10 minute thing per pick was for ad revenue
Yeah I will never forget 2016, the rams were asked to wait a bunch of minutes to turn in the pick to "ramp up drama" even though everyone knew the pick was gonna be Godf
>It's also why The 1st pick takes the whole clock up despite already knowing who they're taking  I just assumed that they let it run in case some other pancake eating motherfucker GM panic called them and offered them a pirate's haul in exchange for the #1  Like yeah you've had months to figure out who you'd take #1 but you've also had months to establish what is the minimum you'd take to trade out of the #1.
On point 2 there is still negotiations. Not really in terms of AAV. But with like guarantees or other stipulations. I remember Bosa on the chargers missed part of training camp because his camp and chargers front office were still negotiating and the contract wasn’t signed yet.
wait the first overall pick taking the whole clock is on purpose? That always confused me
>1. The NFL wants drama and intrigue for the draft and not announcing the 1st pick ahead of time creates that. It's also why The 1st pick takes the whole clock up despite already knowing who they're taking    This is why I don't watch the draft anymore.  Every single pick takes all the clock no matter what. You never get a feel if teams are struggling to figure out a pick, or if things are working out exactly right for them, because each pick takes the exact same amount of time.
> 2. The rookie wage scale mostly eliminates the need to negotiate contracts ahead of time.  Thank JaMarcus The Hutt for the rookie wage scale.
Yeah the NFL was not happy when the Lions announced Hutchinson at #2 without waiting
The NFL wants that but teams are not required to do it.
Honestly, that’s the worst part about the draft.
> It's also why The 1st pick takes the whole clock up despite already knowing who they're taking  I thought it was because the team with the #1 pick was waiting to see if another team desperate for a QB made them a last second offer that they couldn’t refuse.
wait... when OP said 15 years ago they were talking about 2008????
[Summing up my reaction to this post, and then when seeing your comment](https://i.imgflip.com/7hai6v.jpg)
That’s because JaMarcus knew he just pulled off one of the best swindles in the history of the NFL. He had to get every dollar.
Damn they should’ve just held out a little longer.
Man Mario over bush is the number one most shocking thing I’ve seen in sports tbh bush is the best ncaa player I’ve ever laid eyes on
Approximately 0.07% of the US population has the last name Long and 0.03% of the US male population is named Jake. Assuming no relationship between first and last name there is a 0.000023% chance a randomly chosen male will be named Jake Long. If we assume that there is a 1/32 chance of any team getting the first pic there is a 0.00000071% chance that a random male will be named Jake Long and the Dolphins will have the first overall pick.
Man, that Wildcat game where the lowly Dolphins, fresh off the 1-15 season, absolutely demolished the Patriots and stopped their 21 game regular season win streak has to be one of my favorite NFL games of all time. I don't know if anyone has ever taken it to Belichick like the Dolphins did on that Sunday.
Tony  ##FUCKING  SPORANO.  #RIP
> Cleo Lemon at QB  Now there is a name I have not heard in a very long time
I'm happy it was so long ago, it keeps me removed from some very dumb opinions about that draft that I voiced very loudly.  Limas Sweed haunts me to this day.
Right, it doesn’t feel like that long ago that Jake Long was at Michigan and yet… ⚰️
/thread
Man just wait until you find out how long ago 1993 was.
fuck
No one remembers that because they were drafted after the rookie wage scale.   I do remember Mario Williams was drafted over Reggie Bush because of rumors regarding Bush's contract demands.
I can't believe more people didn't notice the the mistake by OP there
I think the real reason it doesn't happen anymore is the rookie pay scale, there just isnt nearly as much to negotiate anymore. Plenty of teams have been open about who they are drafting #1.
Great pick if Pennington stays healthy - in retrospect Matt Ryan would have been better long term.
Why? He would’ve been a HOFer if he didn’t get hurt
Long for the days of being crippled by draft bust contracts?
I don’t think this is happening again either but the 1st pick getting traded is extremely rare.
imagine the Lions if they wernt spending 40% of their cap on Staffird Suh and Megatron
Me too. Like I get the huge contracts were untenable, but it also meant teams had to pay for their draft missteps. When you drafted a QB high and he busted, you were stuck with the contract. Now you can just draft another one the next year and the salary cap ramifications aren't that significant
I miss the wild west too. But the new system is definitely better for allowing teams to become more competitive.  Now you can sign an elite first rounder while not mortgaging your financial future on him, so if you hit, you can have a centerpiece to build a team around. Hard to escape the seller when you get a top pick who takes all your cap money anyways.
It's not better for the players... majority of players are out of the league before their rookie contract is even up.
Precisely 0% of me misses that. It just handicapped already bad teams and made rookie QBs anchors instead of boons. The mild intriuge of signing them isn't worth that at all lmao.
And I personally hate the change. I miss the old way with 1-3 being an all day Saturday event.
I hate it so much. I have fond memories as a kid of grabbing a frozen pizza and a mountain dew and just planting in front of the TV all day Saturday for the NFL Draft. That shit was awesome.
I've watched a couple of the recent drafts but I really don't get it. There's so much analysis going into the draft that anyone who cares knows with about 90% certainty who is getting taken at what position. And really after about the second round there isn't much interest in the actual players being picked.
That too, for sure.
Can't tell if that is a typo or its just that you are a Lions fan.
Is that line from draft day 🤣
Yes there still is, but it's not nearly as common anymore and rarely goes into training camp, which is why I said "mostly" eliminates.
The longer they drag that shit out, the more ad revenue they get. Simple really.
The start coming and they just don't stop
Time marches on.   Please make it stop.
That's not true at all! He wanted some extra prep time in the film room!
Because they couldn't get a contract in place?
You arent taking into account that soon enough someone with the last name Long will have grown up being a fan of the disney channel classic American Dragon Jake Long and name their kid Jake as a result. Clearly the percentage chance name of someone with the last name Long being named Jake is about to skyrocket /s
r/theydidthemath
Does this only take into account someone being named Jake Long and the Dolphins having the #1 pick at the same time? What about the odds of that Jake Long playing football and making it to the nfl…
Eric Mangini, Colt McCoy and Peyton Hills somehow pulled [this off.](https://www.nfl.com/games/patriots-at-browns-2010-reg-9)
He wears his sunglasses at night 😎
We've all made that mistake at some point.  I remember in 2009 being higher on Mark Sanchez than Matthew Stafford. I was very disappointed with the pick (as a lions fan). While there's still a lot of debate on how good Stafford really is, I don't think anyone would argue the difference between those two.
I thought Sweed was a lock to be a solid wideout. Like in Jurassic Park 2, the vision was flawed, it was….not to be.
20?
You take that back. Nick Nurse is a Canadian hero
for sure!
Don't remind me
I remember one year I looked up Suhs cap hit vs one the top defenses which at the time I chose Seahawks legion of Boom and all that. Suh had a greater cap hit than 8 of the 11 starters combined.
Yea, even the refs wouldn’t have been able to help you guys
We were basically punished for nailing the draft 3 out of 4 years (and for sucking).  The #1 pick the year we drafted Stafford wasn’t worth much since the contract would be so high, teams didn’t really want to give up assets for it.
Now imagine the lions if those 3 players were busts
They would have been slightly less shitty??
True but I’m sure they won a lot of games with that elite talent!
People throw this 40% on 3 players number around constantly, look at literally any team in the NFL and you'll see 30%+ on the top 3 players is normal.  Even just this year the Chiefs, are spending 40% of the Cap on Pat Mahomes, Chris Jones, and Joe Thuney.  That was literally the second team I checked, almost any team with a QB on a real contract is going to be spending nearly 40% on their top 3.  Like the rookie contracts were nuts but the Lions hit on the 3 guys, and cap distribution like that is still routine today.  Saying "How could a team hope to succeed spending 40% of their cap on a Pro-bowl caliber QB and 2 HoF caliber players at premium positions" is ridiculous, teams routinely spend that much on worse players these days.
It wasn't just about it being untenable for the teams. I think the players on the whole like the system where the lion's share of that money goes to veteran guys on their 2nd contracts.  Top picks still make a bunch of money, but they aren't getting record breaking deals before ever playing a snap which I think rubbed a lot of their fellow union members the wrong way.
Drafting a bust QB is plenty damaging as is. It's wild to me people really miss the broken ass old wage scale.
Uhh.. wasting a top pick isn't insignificant though. Many franchises get one top 10 pick a decade.  As best I can recall Zeke was the only top 10 pick we had in like 10 years? And we still get shit for taking him.  Edit - ten years, not twenty.
It's better for the players as a whole and not better for top 10-15 picks.  Imagine being a middle round pick that put in 3-4 years and excelled all to then watch some guy who's never played a snap in the NFL get a record breaking contract.
Late day 2 and day 3 guys are getting more guaranteed money than they used to though
And it kind of pushed out vets for cheaper rookies.   But nfl teams weren't able to collude to suppress rookie pay the old fashioned way so they just outlawed the old contract structure.
Man, I loved this.
I do too. The ONLY change I like is how they stopped spoiling every pick
I love the change to Primetime.  But I’m not a kid
I hate the fact that they go into more detailed analysis of players on Day 1 and Day 2 than Day 3. Like, I get that most people watching the first round don't care that much about detailed analysis, but the people still watching Day 3 are
The most accurate mocks with NFL insider intel get at most 14/32. So no, there’s plenty of uncertainty.
You gotta be technically correct to the letter. This is reddit. Come on.
And they don’t stop coming.
Even it’s that adjustment it’s only an 80% chance of it happening, what about the other 20% smart guy /s
The model assumes that any random male could be named Jake Long, so there is no adjustment for how likely someone named Jake Long would play football.    BUT there is a prominent football family with the surname Long.  I believe that this should significantly (but not greatly) increase the odds.
The 1/32 was to account for it being the first overall pick. Every team has a 1/32 chance of getting the first overall in any given year. I was assuming potentially was randomly distributed across the population so it would be like picking one random person which is why the name values apply.
True. No one’s ever called Stafford the Stafchize.
>While there's still a lot of debate on how good Stafford really is  ? I thought 2021 kinda solved this. Last year he was playing injured, something's off with his arm. But he's probably the 3rd-5th best 1st overall QB taken in the last 30 years. Only ones he's definitively worse than are Peyton and Joey B. Without a doubt better than Kyler, Baker, Goff, Winston, Bradford, Jamarcus, Alex Smith, Carr, Vick, Tim Couch, then there are arguing points for others
That’s crazy no offense. Stafford looked so much better that even as a hyped up jets fan I was jealous af we couldn’t figure out a way to get stafford
That’s what I’m going with
No.
Yikes.
The lions really got screwed with all those high picks after the switch to pay slots.
What sucked for us is that was a bad qb class. The next two taken after Stafford were Mark Sanchez and Josh Freeman
What’s that got to do with anything 😭
well shit they probably wouldn't win a super bowl or win in the playoffs often over the last decade or something
They made the playoffs 3  times without the ability to reaky supplement there roster in Free agency, i don’t think they make a SB if those 3 were on modern style rookie contracts but i think the probably make the playoffs more than twice and probably win atlest one playoff game. They would probably look like the colts from 2014 - 20 couple playoff apreances maybe a division win since they did finish 2nd 3 times between. 2011 and 16
You don’t get to make comments like that with that flair
Lmao dude, come on. You’re talking about the Lions being shitty?
Because for a while now one prevalent formula for success has been: QB on cheap rookie deal -> Spend that saved money elsewhere to create a great all around team.  Not having to pay a good QB like they are the most important player for a few years is gonna help a team be successful. Just last year it was: Jags, Chargers, Bengals, Dolphins, Giants as playoff teams with QBs on rookie deals. And over the last few years its a similar look with Allen, Mahomes, Jackson being top QBs without being paid top QB money.  And with the current rookie scale it just shifts where teams money can go. The Stafford, Suh, Megatron Lions couldn't afford to pay any other big time players while they were all still on their first contracts. The point isn't that teams don't attribute a large % of the cap to a small number of players, its that teams can now give out large contracts to veterans, while still having elite talent at premium postions for cheap. Its not the only approach to team building, see any Brady team or the stafford Rams, and it requires hitting on your QB pick, but its not like other methods are foolproof.
Isn't the irony that it actually forces more veterans out of the league? I know it's mentioned elsewhere in this thread, but the meta of team building shifted when rookies could be had on cheap 4-year deals vs more expensive vets
But imagine how funny it would be to watch the Browns continue to fail under the weight of Baker Mayfield’s contract. Or the Cardinals passing up on Kyler Murray cause too much money is invested in Josh Rosen.
If a team is bad, and blows its picks, it absolutely is going to live in the top 10 for years, which is what the Raiders, Browns and Lions did for much of the early 2000s. I see what you're saying, but Zeke wasn't even a bust. Obviously you wouldn't take him at that spot in a redraft, but he's not really what I'm talking about.
It a team gets one top 10 pick a decade it doesn’t matter if they are successful or not. That is a well run franchise that won’t be broken by the pick. It’s not like NBA where the talent drop off between between top 3 or even top 10 picks is huge. I don’t think any team not picking top 10 is stuck in purgatory because of the draft.
Since 2002 the cowboys have picked in the top 10 5 times and Micah’s draft we had the 10th pick before we traded back   1.8 Roy Williams 2002  1.5 Terence Newman 2003  1.9 Tyron Smith 2011  1.6 Morris Claiborne 2012  1.4 Zeke Elliott 2016
That's a small percentage of players. The average NFL career is 3 years. Middle if the pack players weren't getting paid but rookies and superstars would.   Have that exact situation now. Except now the superstars get paid more %of the cap and the rookies get less.
> And it kind of pushed out vets for cheaper rookies.  Not really. The only rookies who made much less money under the wage scale were 1st rounders, and obviously they were getting playing time anyway. And while 2nd rounders did still make somewhat less money, they weren't making much in the pre-scale days either.  Plus some late 1st rounders under the old system were actually worse off because they had 5-year deals where the last year was still fairly cheap rather than getting a big raise with the 5th year option.
Sadly, it has enhanced the product on the field, though. But it was at the expense of the players. I can't imagine any newly drafted player being happy about the current structure. Especially someone playing QB getting picked late in the 1st.  Congratulations you're an underpaid starter and have 0 say on your contract until year 6/7ish.. first 4 under contract for rookie, 5th year option is only a team option, and back to back franchise tags.
Always had some people over and made a party out of it. Hard to do on a random ass Thursday night now.
That's why you never use absolutes. That way you can "well ackchyually" their "gotcha".
Stafford is absolutely better than Joey B Jesus Christ.  He’s the 3rd best 1st overall pick after Manning and Elway
I swear if it were anyone but the Lions, the League would have given them an effective cap hit of those draft picks equal to the current pay slots for the duration of their rookie contracts.
Hey now, Josh was looking to be pretty good before the drugs and the weird Michael-Jackson-baby-tiger-tribute photo shoot thing.
The following year was worse. Sanchez and freedman both were starting caliber QBs and stafford threw for 5k in his first full season
Which should have made the #1 pick really valuable.  Although Stafford was no slam dunk himself, many fans wanted Aaron Curry.
They’re stating that you could be spending 40% of your cap on busts during that period, which would severely handicap your franchise.
I think kids these days don't appreciate how fucking awesome Calvin Johnson really was
You don't even have flair
At the time yes. Shit recognizes shit.
I'm not totally sure if it's had that effect.  Most rookies weren't very expensive back then either. After the 1st round the salaries really started to nose dive and if you were like a 3rd round pick I think you'd only get like 1 year of very little money anyway.  The biggest shift is that those premium rookie contracts have been tempered and guys who do make it through the gauntlet and have been actually doing labor for the NFL get a chance to cash in.
I think the Browns might have pulled Baker when he was injured instead of just letting him keep playing if he were under a crazy-ass contract. Then again, it's the Browns. Who knows.
It really created a viscous cycle.   Teams spend an assload on a rookie. That rookie arrives in a terrible environment, set up to fail. The rookie sucks, the team goes 5-11, fires their coach, and spends a top 10 pick on an ungodly expensive rookie.  I like the way it is now. Teams should suck the old fashioned way, through shear incompetence, not because they had to pay out the ass for a guy who hasn't even played in the NFL.
Browns were still failing on drafting till like 2017 despite having constant top 10 picks lol
The Jaguars picked top 10 for a full decade I think.  They broke the chain in 2017 but went right back after that year until again this last year.
To further your point, look at the Cardinals. They drafted two QBs with their first round pick in back-to-back years. No way in hell would they have done that before the rookie wage scale, because they would've been paying out the ass for Josh Rosen.
My apologies. I don't know why I said 20 years. I forgot about those rough years in the oughts I geuss. Stupid of me.
It's a bigger percentage of players than were getting it when there was no rookie wage scale. Back then the top top picks got the bulk of it anyway.  The difference now is it gets spent in FA rather than on rookies.  Also, superstars that have time in should get paid more. They're the ones generating the revenue.
People will also point to the drop in the average NFL career in the 2010s, but I think it's a lot more to do with the fact that they expanded to a 53 man roster.  There's guys who drag that average down who would've had a career length of 0 years when it was smaller.
It's at the expense of highly drafted rookies. Veterans and late rounders who earn a payday are benefitted.
I remember during the lockout vets were outspoken about the rookies shaking Goodell hand on stage like "its about solidarity as I try to cut your pay"  Not sure about product on the field more rookies makes September the real preseason with some televised practices a few weeks before.
The calculation is implying that the person who is selected 1st overall has the given odds of being named Jake Long. The odds would be the same if the question was whether exactly the 74th selected person was named Jake long because the point is that it's saying if we select exactly one person from the pool, what are the odds their name is Jake Long.
Uh, no he's not. Burrow has been elite the last two years. I love Stafford but he never reached that level.
The what now?    Gonna go do some googling now
And as a Seahawks fan, I wish y’all had taken him.
Like the Raiders from 2003-2010.
It has definitely had an effect. Maybe not as noticeable as you'd think but it's fundamentally changed how rosters are shaped around the edges. Think of things like the Bears moving on from Robbie Gould. The only reason that happened was because the veteran minimum is higher than the rookie minimum. Having your backups all be veterans is definitely not as common as it used to be, especially with certain positions like special teams and RB
Definitely. They're the poster child. Absolutely unheard of to give up on your highly-drafted QB after a single season before the wage scale.
It prevented lions situations / 1st rd picks asking for the moon etc...
Stafford has the most 4Q comebacks of all time and hit that goal in 10 years. He’s played on very shitty rosters. Him, Suh, and Megatron made up 40% of the salary cap at one point:  It’s not surprising he won a SB his first year with the rams or the year he had a top 5 defense he made the playoffs in 2014.  I’m curious how old you are. Excluding his rookie year - Burrow has the best WR corps in the NFL and a top 10-15 offense and defense. He has had more support in the last 2 years than Stafford did.   Stafford always had garbage o lines and defense excluding 2014. His best running back was either Joique Bell in 2014 or Darrell Henderson
https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2013/0204/jackson/1-2048X1219.jpg
You guys may not have drafted Russ and won the Super Bowl so I’d say it worked out for you in the long run.
I mean yea veterans do get replaced by younger players I'm just not sure it's happening a whole lot more than it used to or happening enough to say that the rookie pay scale has been a net negative for veteran players.  A guy that's been in the NFL since 2005 might not be the best example of what you're getting at. Sure he got replaced at some point. I'd imagine he's also benefited from the excess money that goes to FA since this change.
33 and a Vikings fan. I've seen his entire career. As I said I'm a fan, but I also recognize Burrow is better.
Cocaine
Fair point!
Tampa.
This feels like a list made by a dude who only started watching the NFL in November.
This list doesn’t make sense
I closed it when I saw Pete Carroll at 11...this is list is just weird.
I find it interesting that pretty much all 56 comments are trashing this list for various reasons, yet no one has mentioned Todd Bowles at #23.  He's atrocious as a head coach.  Tampa is keeping him (presumably) to tank the team, not win games.  He should be last.  Maybe even in his own category below the new hires.
Lol @ Pete being at #11. Dude keeps winning despite a host of issues year to year, and very suspect rosters the past few years  in a very competitive division over most of that time -- with last season making the playoffs and having half our team be 2022 draft rookings when most pundits thinking they'd be a 5 win team.   It doesn't matter what roster Pete has, he makes it work, and putting him so low is downright insulting to his capabilities as a coach. That's what a great coach does.
McCarthy at 21 is laughable and the reasoning is somehow even worse.
Kind of confused about Arthur Smith being ranked 22^nd . Last season we were widely regarded to have the worst roster in the NFL, yet Smith still took the team to a 7-9 record. He's had to work with basically nothing since he got here, and has kept the team competitive.  Personally, with the team finally able to make positive roster moves, I'm excited to see what Smith can do. I'm not saying he's Top 10 in the league, but 6th worst coach outside of new hires seems overly harsh.
My take away from this and every comment here is that nobody really knows how to separate a coach's contributions vs. a QB's contributions, and that will likely never go away.   Is Andy Reid a better coach than BB simply because he got Mahomes and BB lost Brady? Who knows.   Is Zac Taylor a good coach, or did he just get Joe Burrow and great defensive coordinator? Who knows.   Is Sean McVay still a wizard, or was he unable to keep his team together while running out the string with a bad backup QB? Who knows.   Is Matt LaFleur still going to be a good coach even if the Packers only win 5-7 games next year if Jordan Love looks like he doesn't have it? Who knows.   Is Pete Carrol a Top-10 coach because he made it the playoffs with Geno Smith, even though he underperformed in the playoffs for the last 8 years with Russell Wilson? Who knows? Hell, maybe he was even covering for Wilson.   Is Doug Pederson the coach that took Nick Foles and won Philly it's first super bowl ever, or is he the coach that let it all fall apart in Philly once Wentz and Foles ran out of magic? Who knows.
random but I think Tomlin might be my favorite non-Eagles coach.  No-nonsense but effective and seems to establish great relationships with his players.  his record speaks for itself.
I think Mike Sirianni rank 8 and Brian Daboll rank 15 should have a better rank than this.
That’s Tank Commander Eberflus to you, sir, show some gosh darn respect
Dan Campbell too high, Mike McCarthy way too low
Harbaugh should not be ahead of mike Tomlin…
Daboll 15th??? After sending Uber drivers and a qb who everyone thought was a huge bust to the Divisional round is crazy. He did better than Joe Judge with a roster that was much worse.
For as much of a Vrabel stan as I am, I don't know how this is being graded. Guess there's a lot of stock being placed in him pulling the previous four winning seasons out of his ass and managing to win seven games with a bottom 5 roster as opposed to Brian Daboll making Daniel Jones look competent or O'Connell winning 13 games.
The fuck is being ranked here? How good they were last season? How good they’ll be next season? How good they’ve been in their careers? How good they’ve been in the last 5 years?   This amalgamation of bullshit makes no sense lmfao.
Zac Taylor continues to be underrated
What criteria puts Harbaugh at 4 and Pete Carroll at 11.
IMO Zac should be higher than 12. He has had two great seasons back to back and the players love him.
They did AS dirty
The Arthur smith disrespect is crazy
I’m sorry but I don’t think I can ever put Reid about Belichick in a ranking. Even if this is specifically for 2023.
It is really hard to separate coach/qb combos.  Reid was always a decent coach but could never get any traction in the playoffs till he got Mahomes.  Belichick always had traction in the playoffs till he lost Brady.  Payton had some success in NO but how much of that was due to Brees? It is the chicken or egg question.  I any case, Carroll is too low and Shanny is way overrated on this list.
Dougie P should be above Mike Vrabel. A travesty
Josh McDaniels at any point, but dead last makes zero sense.  Edit- also Staley shit the bed multiple times...
Josh McDaniels is ranked too high.
Putting kyle shanahan above mike tomlin is fucking hilarious
65 comments and no mention of Dan Campbell. He must be rated where he belongs.  #14 with a bullet.  Looking like we finally got the right guy.
Dougie P should be #2!
Please stop with Belichick is a great coach, much less the GOAT bullshit. I wouldn’t even put him in the top half of coaches as he can’t even hire a decent OC… You take away TB12 and he sucked in Cleveland, he sucked his 1st year in NE, and he’s sucks as a HC post TB12. On top of that NE played in one of the worst, if not the worst division in football for two decades until the Bills finally got good the last couple years. The amount of hype and praise this dude gets drives me crazy!!!   Andy Reid defiantly deserves #1! That is all…
McD, Carroll, and Taylor certainly all lower than should be. Why is Harbaugh so high up right now, same with Belichek? Unless this is a career-long overview as opposed to a current ranking.
This whole list is nothing but hot garbage
This article is dead last on the 2023 nfl coach ranking rankings
This list is terrible
Ehh 20 sounds about right, maybe put him a little higher
i’m still taking Bill over the field
20??? No fuckin way
Mcvay at 3 confuses me the most.  Did he watch last season?  The guy nearly quit the NFL...
And one that didn’t notice we already traded away the first pick.
Seems more like a list of best careers combined with giant pile of recency bias.
No, it really doesnt after Andy Reid at #1.
The list is only out of 27 coaches. It's not entirely unreasonable.
ranking Carroll at 11 when Harbaugh is ranked 4th is very peculiar, i agree
I hate pete. Hes the bane of my exsistence. I wish I could watch patrick willis push pete into a mud puddle and give him wedgies.   The reason is because pete carroll is such a good fucking coach that the awful, evil, dastardly, sonofabitchin, rain city bitch pigeon, seahawks are always a threat.  If we are basing this off of last year i would have pete over mcvay, harbaugh and belichick (if this is based off last year)
Pete has been a top 5 coach his whole time in Seattle, he just never gets the media attention and at this point never will.
Yep. Gives all credit to Moore for the 4-1 stretch with Rush and makes it appear that only putting up 12 in the playoff game had nothing to do with his playcalling but starts off seemingly giving credit ro MM for us having back to back 10+ win seasons. Shit, last offseason we were projected to get the last wild card seed if things went right and we still won the same amount of games as the year before. Ranking last offseason: 21. Ranking this offseason: 21.   The whole goddamn list after #1 and the reasonjng for a lot of them are just plain stupid.
This writer clearly has a personal problem with McCarthy to the point where they’re making up shit and purposefully ranking them lower than at least ten coaches he’s as good as or better. Such a loser.
Did you look at the rest of the rankings? The whole thing is all over the place.
The jury is still out on Arthur Smith, but I think when adding in rookie contributions the Falcons roster was not worse any league nowhere near it. 7 wins is about what I would expect for that roster. And the passing game was horrible. Of course you can blame Mariotta, but we’ve seen other coaches do more with less. I’m not high on Smith, but will reserve judgment until end of year.
I lost all respect for Tomlin years ago when he purposefully *tried to trip* ~~tripped and injured~~ an opposing player running down the sidelines on a kick return. Could have ruined that kids career.  I always appreciated the Jags/Steelers rivalry, but I can't stand their coach after that.      Edit:  I was actually thinking about that Jets coach that did in fact trip and injure an opposing player, but my point still stands.  He obviously acted purposefully.  Not only was he standing way too close to the edge of the field on purpose, but as someone else pointed out, he was looking at the jumbo tron to see when he needed to "act" like he was moving out of the way, when in fact his first action was to step into the field of the play before jumping out.  That is a scumbag move, and he does not deserve anyone's respect.
Belichick and Reid are 1A/1B lately. Tomlin, Carroll, Shanahan and McVay are all 2A-D.
Sirianni has 1 great year with what most everyone agreed was the best roster in the league, not sure I'd have him above Pete Carroll. Daboll somehow worked wonders with not a lot,  he could be higher, but again only 1 year to judge.
Eh you can really easily make a case for either one, it’s a coin flip imo.
Harbaugh and Tomlin have similar levels of success and Harbaugh has had half as many years with great QB play.
Imagine saying this a year and a half ago
I'm still under the opinion that it's more talent and less coaching  Edit: big lou has a major part in this. I just don't see it with taylor
I think Zac is rated too high, he’s being carried by Burrow and an elite WR group.   Zac’s riding the Bengals success.   I am not saying he’s a bad coach, but I don’t think he would rank as high if he was coaching a different team.   That being said I wouldn’t drop him too far down by any means. He was able to accomplish something the Bengals haven’t done in a while… Beat the Browns 😂.
Even at 12 the entire blurb about him was very backhanded.
Wait, so you talk about reid, belichick, and payton owe success to their qbs yet shanny is overrated? Shanny never had a qb. By your own metric shanny is underrated.   And i disagree with that metric
> Reid was always a decent coach but could never get any traction in the playoffs till he got Mahomes.  He made it to 5 NFC Championship Games with the Eagles...  I agree that it's hard to separate the two, and Mahomes *is* the difference maker in the playoffs, but Reid has always been much more than a "decent" HC.
How?
Better than belichek? Lol
2 super bowl appearances in 5 years. How far down do you want him just because his team was obliterated with injuries last year?  Bellichick seems too high from last 3 years, especially with coaching decision and sloppy play last year.  Carroll seems too low  I dunno, feels weird to rank coaches and not sure what their criteria or timeline was even.
This is about success not if the guy wants to continue coaching, why are you bringing up him contemplating retiring? Dude has been to the playoffs 4 times, won coach of the year, won the division 3 times, won the NFC twice and went to the bowl twice, winning it once, all since 2017. Not to mention he inherited a dog shit team outside of gurley and Donald and turned around a broken Jared Goff. His team was historically injured and he started 4 QBs last year, lost his entire secondary outside of Ramsey, lost his WR 1 & 2, had TWELVE different starting offensive lines, and then lost his best defensive player for the last half of the season and still managed to get some wins. It isn’t his fault the team was starting practice squad players.
To name this as a "2023 Coach Ranking" is what especially discredits this list. This basically says this is "who's hot and who's not" based on recent trajectory and success. The rankings don't reflect this premise.          &nbsp;     **6. Mike Tomlin** - tied for most losses for Steelers in 20 years last season at 9-8, just outside top 5 (regardless still had a great turnaround in second half of season)    **8. Nick Sirianni** - blew up the NFC with a near perfect record and now returns from Super Bowl - sneaks into the top 10    **9. Mike Vrabel** - coming off a disappointing collapse and the most losses in 8 years (10) for the Titans - top 10       **11. Pete Carroll** - coming off a year they expected to get the 1st overall pick but instead went to playoffs - not top 10        **21. Mike McCarthy** - finished his second consecutive season going 12-5 for Cowboys, bottom 1/3 of the league
McDaniels last is good too.
I get not ranking new hires, but Payton and Reich could have been included considering they have a prior resume
I hate you. But I respect you.
Shame to see, he's a hell of a coach. I'm sure the Seahawks players had chips on their shoulders after the Russ trade saga but that was not meant to be a >5 win roster. They made the playoffs.  Other than his odd stretch in New England (where he wasn't even bad), he's been of the best head coaches in the NFL year in, year out
We had the most dead cap in NFL history with the cheapest defense in the NFL. For the most part, we were starting backups and our backups were practice squad guys on other rosters.
Well he didn’t trip and injure anyone, just got onto the field enough to make him have to divert and allowed the defenders to catch him.
>I lost all respect for Tomlin years ago when he purposefully tripped and injured an opposing player running down the sidelines on a kick return.   Ok but he didn't trip or injure him. It was a fucked up situation but nowhere near this level.
the Ravens one? I don't really have any skin in the game but I dunno how you can call that purposeful - he was looking at the jumbotron on opposite side of the field.  every team has a  'Get Back' coach to prevent exactly this sorta situation, which happens naturally if they're not doing their job.
that move was 100% problematic but the man has 16 entire seasons of top-notch leadership and a winning record opposing it. He shouldn't have obstructed a play, I imagine he won't ever do anything like that again, and he has my total respect even as a Steelers hater
Eagles were projected 6.5 wins his first year and he got them 9 wins. They were projected 9.5 wins last year and they got 14. Constantly overachieves.
I mean how do you possibly put Daboll under Campbell though?
Not to people who are fans of the other 31 teams
I was one of a small minority who did not want Zac & Lou fired, mostly because I watched Zac play in college & he’s an awesome guy
I agree on both. I think Zac is decent but Burrow definitely makes him appear better than he is. And Lou might actually be the best defensive coordinator. In disbelief we have another season with him.
Tbh I agree with both points. Lou has turned our defense UP. I also think Zac is coming into his own but overall I still think a lot of it is due to the talent on the offense.
Zac Taylor has had more success in his tenure than the entirety of the new browns lol.
I didn't say they owed their success to their QBs I said it is hard to separate the two.    Also, Shanny is overrated because he is not a good head coach. He is a glorified OC at this point, plays not to lose and does not understand the emotional dynamic of the game. Carroll is a far better head coach who gets the most out of the players he has.
Shanahan is the #1 coach by a pretty good margin if we're being objective lol.
He did beat him head to head in the Superbowl…but still no.
The list just makes no sense I’m mean we have Zac Taylor not even in the 10 top and he’s gone to a Super Bowl and conference championship last 2 years. I mean they have Peterson over him with the jags. I don’t think Mcvay should be that high and bill should be close to the bottom.
> How far down do you want him just because his team was obliterated with injuries last year?  That's basically the 49ers every year but I don't see Shanahan at #1.  This isn't "overall coach ranks" this is "2023 NFL Coach ranks" which infers that last season is weighted the most, since it is about the upcoming season.
If we are being consistent with grades? Pretty far down. Kyle was obliterated the same or worse 2 different times and both times people were calling for his job, a lot of people.
McCarthy has his flaws sure, but 21st back to back years on this list is insanely stupid.
I put this in another reply but Ill drop it here too Re MM:  Yep. Gives all credit to Moore for the 4-1 stretch with Rush and makes it appear that only putting up 12 in the playoff game had nothing to do with his playcalling but starts off seemingly giving credit ro MM for us having back to back 10+ win seasons. Shit, last offseason we were projected to get the last wild card seed if things went right and we still won the same amount of games as the year before. Ranking last offseason: 21. Ranking this offseason: 21.   The whole goddamn list after #1 and the reasonjng for a lot of them are just plain stupid.
Mike Vrabel is definitely a top 10 coach though.
Mcgrary, Lindstrom, Matthews, Allegiers, AK47, AJ Terrell, Drake London, Grady Jarrett ,Kyle Pitts, Patterson, are all good players. Some others sucked like our starting safeties but this is not a team devoid of talent.
lmao i like tomlin but he very clearly was intending to impede the progress of jacoby jones  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NpzVqPvfFU  0:46. look at his eyes and how he doesn't move until the last second, giving his guys time to catch jones  he 100% knew what he was doing, c'mon
It was almost definitely purposeful (only say “almost” because of course the only way to be absolutely sure is if he admitted it) but it didn’t result in tripping or injuring anyone.
Betting odds are weird as hell. I genuinely can't think of a position group Philly wasn't top 5-10 in before the season other than QB, but I've been a Hurts believer since the end of 2021-22.  Not a knock against Siriani at all, all indications show he's a good head coach
Harbaugh has a better Plsyiff record than Tomlin despite having 5 total years of great QB play vs 8-9 for Tomlin
Anyone who wants Lou fired is an idiot. He's whipped up amazing defenses every year
My point was that success is from having 3 amazing WRs and one of the best QBs in football.   Lol all you want, you didn’t really make a relevant point, I wasn’t comparing the 2.   Also my comment is something I have heard many bengals fans discuss. 🤷‍♂️
> He is a glorified OC at this point, plays not to lose and does not understand the emotional dynamic of the game.  dang making 3 NFC title games in 4 years is pretty good for a coach that is a glorified OC who plays not to lose and doesn't understand the emotional dynamic of the game
Lol, the jags are the nfl love story right now after how they finished last year. I got murdered in another thread just by suggesting maybe we don't call them contenders already, and that I wouldn't count out the titans and Vrabel if they can fix their roster at all just cuase they were obliterated with injuries last year.
If belicheck retired the patriots would be competing for the number 1 overall pick. Garbage take
> This isn't "overall coach ranks" this is "2023 NFL Coach ranks" which infers that last season is weighted the most, since it is about the upcoming season.  No, that would be a "2022 coach ranks". This is 2023, and, based on the writing, is very clearly an assessment of their coaching ability right now, not just a report card of their most recent season.
Yea that makes sense. I wasn't sure if they were only using last year cause bellichick that high makes no sense then.
Came here to defend that. Homerism aside Vrabel has done nothing to show that he shouldn't still be included in the upper echelon of coaches.
But we are talking about last years pre-season expectations. No one knew that Allgeier, AK, or London we’re anything yet.   This isn’t really debatable just Google “predicting every nfl teams record 2022
Yeah he was clearly watching the field once he knew Jones was close so he could jump out of the way and not actually hit him.
Agreed. Our fans in general I think underestimated how little we had personnel wise on D when Lou came in.   Similarly I’m not worried about the safeties this year, one has learned for a year already from Lou & Scott looks like Vonn Bell 2.0, & their RAW scores are much much higher. The safeties will have less experience, yes, but they’re going to be much more athletic.
If Bill retired that pick might actually pan out. I think if bill wasn’t the head coach last year they might have been better because he had a very incompetent coaching staff.
Well hes the GM too so hes part of that problem.
> is very clearly an assessment of their coaching ability right now,  ...which means that the most recent season is weighted the most since it is a measure of ability in 2023 and not overall ability.  That's how these things work, if it was an overall ranking BB would be first without question.  McVay just finished an awful season and his 'strategy' caused his team to fall apart in 2022, so putting him at third overall shows how little thought went into this list.
He's great. His COTY performance was unbelievable with how injured that team was.
We are talking about whether the roster is good or not. Falcons roster has ok talent not great but not bottom of league.
Bill the GM doesn't make the bill the coach lesser.
>That's how these things work  That's just, like, your opinion man  He can rank them based on whatever criteria he wants lol
I think you’re a bit lost bud you were arguing about how you expected this team to get 7 wins this season in response to the above commenters saying 7 wins was more than anyone expected us to get this past season
> He can rank them based on whatever criteria he wants lol  That's true, but these are the 2023 NFL Coach Rankings.  Not the Overall NFL Coach Rankings.  Statistically that means two different things.  If you ranked NFL wide receivers vs 2023 NFL Wide Receivers those are two different lists.
Yes. That is your list, and this is his.  "He didn't put Shanahan #1, therefore his criteria is wrong" lol. Sorry bud, that's not how it works.
It's not insiderdom that's broken. It's the lack of consequences for "journalists" that repeatedly post untrue or biased stories. The whole business is exhausting.
> In 24 hours, Florio went from writing that a source told him Belichick has “shopped Jones to multiple teams” to saying that he doesn’t know whether Belichick was “really serious” about trading his young QB.  >Those are two very different statements, but it doesn’t matter. The story is out there.  >Meanwhile, two respected local Patriots reporters, The Boston Herald’s Andrew Callahan and MassLive’s Mark Daniels, each reported the Patriots won’t trade Jones. Both cited league sources.  >But unfortunately for them, Florio’s megaphone is louder, and his speculation is juicier.  >This is the second time that Florio has written about Belichick and Jones, only to backtrack when asked about his own reporting. Back in October, when Jones was rehabbing an ankle injury, Florio wrote there were “uncharacteristic rumblings surrounding the relationship between the Patriots and Jones.”  >Then on WEEI, Florio claimed he’s only written about Belichick and Jones’ relationship in a “vague, loose way.”  >Florio is trying to have it both ways. While he’s writing actual reports about Belichick being unhappy with Jones, he doubts their credibility when he’s on the radio.  >This is what often happens when NFL Insiders, or any sports reporter, moonlight as radio guests. They say what they would never write, or vice versa.  >That’s what happened to Ben Volin, the Boston Globe’s national NFL writer. During an October appearance on WEEI, he quoted “somebody” from his Twitter DMs who told him “Mac’s attitude problem is obvious in the building and everyone knows it.”  >But as it turns out, the DM was a lie. He was fooled by a Stoolie.  >For the next several weeks, we will likely hear much more “chatter” about the Patriots shopping Jones. After all, there is so much time to fill. There’s destined to be a lot of hot air.  >Florio and the like are happy to provide it.
It's crazy how many negative rumors surround the Patriots after 4 years of not winning a Super Bowl. Easy target for generating clicks. Zero chance Kraft ever pressures Bill to leave.
Protip: don't give a fuck about these types of reports in the offseason.  Most of this stuff is pure speculation or smokescreen or just old fashion clickbait.
Yeah, Florio is a hack, water makes things wet, what's new
Sources have told me these are rumors spread by NFL execs to misled the public and deflect from the fact that Aaron Rodgers is still a Green Bay Packer
Journalists used to take pride in what they reported. But a click is a click now, doesn’t matter if the info is true or not.. this problem spreads much further than sports journalism.
Last summer when we were getting reports on how QBs were doing in 7 on 7 drills I felt like sports reporting had completely jumped the shark.
Blame the fans for insatiably devouring every bit of news.  We have some responsibility in this too.
And now our afternoon radio show here in Boston is 100% sure this is real, Mac hates everyone, Pats HATE Mac and he's betrayed the Patriots so F him and I hope he loses every game and the propaganda type fans all fall in line.   Toxic as hell
It's the Patriots. Lies always travel so so much faster than truth with the Patriots.   Didn't matter that deflategate got entirely debunked, didn't matter that the Wickersham report was transparently fake and denied by all sides of the story and all insiders, doesn't matter that the "taping the Rams practice" thing was a fake story.   People swallow it down and when all the yahoos on the radio pretend its real because it gives them something to talk about, the yahoos listening pretend its real too. And when everyone pretends something is real...
From the article  >In 24 hours, Florio went from writing that a source told him Belichick has “shopped Jones to multiple teams” to saying that he doesn’t know whether Belichick was “really serious” about trading his young QB.  >Those are two very different statements, but it doesn’t matter. The story is out there.  I feel like this segment of the article distills the argument the author is trying to make... but I don't really see it TBH. Like, I'm not defending Florio here as a shit-stirrer, but those 2 statements aren't exactly incongruous or contradictory.   If you're noticing your otherwise decent car making a new rattle and it spurs you to swing by a car lot to check out what the new models are like even if you had NO intent or capability of buying, is it contradictory to say you went car shopping but you weren't "really serious" about buying?  It wouldn't surprise me if Bill made some calls, whether direct or back door, to try and asses the trade value of Jones especially if there is some tension between the 2. At that point, I wouldn't even say that Florio saying "Belichick was shopping Jones" is that inflammatory.
It's hilarious redditors getting enraged about journalists  creating articles purely for clicks (the monetary basis of modern journalism and most media even though it's usually dishonest in some way) yet when these articles are posted they will join into the conversation with no critical judgement on whether it's true.
I agree with what they’re saying overall but the example with Florio isn’t a good one. He said - with supposed insider knowledge - that the Pats were shopping around Jones.   In subsequent interviews, he says he’s unsure if the Pats would actually trade him, and that he expects him to compete with Zappe for the starting role.  Both of those things can be true. There are many reasons a team can shop a player then decide not to trade them. Even if just to send a message. How does that make his first report wrong?
Media reports on media. Ouroboros sucks own dick.
I always think it's funny when sports journalists start beating their chests about Freedom Of The Press and Speaking Truth To Power and shit, like they're investigating Watergate instead of just copy/pasting whatever Drew Rosenhaus would like to see on Sportscenter tomorrow.  "NFL insiderdom" is broken because any idiot with a 6th grade education can transcribe Patrick Mahomes saying "this was a great team win, now we're excited to play Denver next week," so these jobs are incredibly replaceable. The only way to make money in it is to build a brand, and the only way to build a brand is to get attention, and the best way to get attention is to be sensational, and the best way to be sensational is to report whatever crazy rumors you hear whether they're true or not, and there are no consequences for being wrong because ultimately it just doesn't really matter.
Hah, "is broken."  OK zoomer. This shit has been like this forever, its just that its gone national, where before, you had local talking heads with egos and bullshit.
So many words to say “our whole industry is bullshit”
Nobody gave a shit when PFT was full of shit over Tua rumors (and still floats Lamar Jackson BS).  Why is this any different?
Florio and PFT are garbage.  PFT is just an aggregator with little original news.  I've said this before, but I think posts here should be from the original posters which are typically local beat writers or more informed insiders.    PFT is just making AD rev. off of other people's work.  Personally, I filter out the domain in my reddit app/res as well as the tag for him and the site.
Journalists at every level and in every sector/market are complete hacks now.  It all about clicks and getting people to your content, no matter how incorrect or speculative it is.  They have no integrity anymore across the board.
I hear way too much about Mac Jones than I care about lol.
Stop clicking on the links yall
"My sources tell me"  I always assume they mean "The voices in my head"
Florio is such a clown. No integrity.
You think this is bad? You should look at inside source journalism on professional wrestling lol
This is what happens when 24/7 journalism is a requirement. They have to post stories and opinions because they need content.
This is no different than the bogus stories that popped up (and keep popping up) about the Dolphins looking for a Tua replacement. Journalists seek to invent conflict where there is none.
The NFL doesn't have a Woj or Shams because it seems like NFL insiders prioritize relations with the front office.    Woj and Shams have built a repoire with players AND the front office.    The closest the NFL has is a former punter that has a podcast.
After the season I kinda just tune out everything that isn't the draft or confirmed stories of people being traded/signed. I'm just too old to care about the locker room drama I guess. Now get off my lawn.
I can’t for the life of me understand why Florio posts are still allowed on this sub.
Does it?
I'm failing to see how the Mac Jones story shows anything is broken. It just seems like your average offseason unconfirmed-but-plausible storyline.
Shows how soft everyone is.  Bill has free reign to do whatever he wants. Anyone saying otherwise is actually brain dead. He is literally the GOAT head coach.   It was always known the Patriots way wasn't easy, but players like Randy Moss went there to win. He didn't win a SB but he sure as hell won games. Plenty of others won super bowls.
Insiders have been getting "the Mac Jones" story wrong since before he was drafted. The massive amounts of backpedaling when the Niners didn't draft him was insane. I thought it was clear the Niners weren't looking for him when they traded up. And then when they got it wrong they INSISTED they were still right...somehow.
This is what happens when you give a megaphone like Twitter to morons. We can help by not amplifying their idiocy.
TLDR: Florio sucks a lot
the nature and tone of this article are weird and it doesn't prove anything   its not like ppl have found evidence that completely debunked florio's claim. it's just one side's unnamed sources vs another sides unnamed sources but this blog is going about the 'state of journalism' bc like they're a competitor of PFTs  there's a very weird defensiveness to this whole saga. when have you ever seen so many third tier writers and blogs try to disprove something so mild as a head coach kicking the tires on his qb's trade value?
Long article to say that Florio is piece of shit.
Oh my God lol all the salty patriots fans. This shit has been going on in the NFL forever. Just because it's happening to our team now you all want to post about how dishonest the media is. "Insiders" are just putting out shit articles for you to click on and you give it the attention it needs to become bigger.
Man, Florio making shit up about AFC East QBs finally caught up to him huh ? #Tuanon
I'm hearing that ProFootballTalk aren't happy with Florio and may let him go. Don't be surprised if he ends up at Barstool.
Half the shit Florio says is made up bullshit to get the clicks and sell ads. Not sure how many times this has to happen before people stop listening to this hack.
Pay attention to LITERAL GOSSIP MONGERS, you're going to get a lot of gossip with no substance. 🤷‍♂️
Theoretically, couldn't both be true?   I don't think it's super outlandish that Bill Belichick called up a couple of GMs and said "what would you give me for Mac Jones?" in the hopes that someone would give multiple firsts as a massive overpay, and then nobody was biting so he's keeping Jones as the QB.  Seems to me like he could have just been doing due diligence on a player who is potentially super valuable on the trade market instead of there necessarily being a giant rift between him and his QB.
Journalism is dead. Not broken. Dead. D-E-D, dead.
When it comes to the so called nfl insiders , by insiders they mean they ass kiss , associate with , and generally do whatever it takes to keep officials from various clubs and the league office happy .   There are few , if any truly objective journalists overnight in the nfl these days , because they are afraid to criticize anyone for fear of being ostracized, and losing their relationship and access to future “ inside information.   They have no more legitimacy than the state media of China or North Korea .  They just report about the nfl propaganda instead  of government ones.
This is just basically criticizing talking mouths for being what they are paid to do....  If you're going to criticize the state of specifically NFL " insider's "  today, then I feel more detail needs to be put in explaining why it is the way it is.  A sports journalist giving information lives and dies by their sources. In 2023 with information literally accessible 24/7 in the palm of your hand, I imagine it " taints " credible sources.   Don't get me wrong, a ton of what is said is speculation based on perhaps the mere whisper of a truth, but in some ways it had always been that way.   Peter King to me is a prime example of someone who does their best to really make sure there is validity to their sources before writing up what he feels based on those sources.   Basically, I don't fully get the hatred some people have for people like Florio or even their local beat writers.
Basically it’s the Fox News-ification of all media. Report whatever gets attention, but couch it in “people are saying” without any credible source.
This is like exhibit 9001 of why Florio should be banned from this sub.
Florio's a fucking hack who owns his own business to publish bullshit with impunity.
Sorry, but the sports press in large part, are scummy trash.
Florio has broken trust one too many times and I think I'm done with him as a reporter. The consequences to dogshit clickbait sports journalism should be that we turn those sources off. He should be banned here.
TLDR: Florio is a tool who seems like he got caught making shit up.
The problem is journalism and American Media ever seriously allowing “Unnamed Sources”      That move alone has diminished journalism to tabloid level among all outlets
Anything that just says “sources” without a name should be demonetized by google and the writers should be removed from being able to charge subscriptions. Not just football related.
>That’s what happened to Ben Volin, the Boston Globe’s national NFL writer. During an October appearance on WEEI, he quoted “somebody” from his Twitter DMs who told him “Mac’s attitude problem is obvious in the building and everyone knows it.”  >But as it turns out, the DM was a lie. He was fooled by a Stoolie.  Isnt this the same motherfucker who started the false "patriots taped practices" narrative back around spygate?????
Seems like there are 2 main kinds of sports journalists. The ones like Schefter who are basically PR mouthpieces for teams/agents and the ones like Florio who make shit up for attention.    Is anyone independent *and* honest in sports journalism?
It really is a microcosm of the issues with information in the social media era. Florio makes a wild, unsubstantiated claim about them shopping Mac Jones. Next thing you know that rumor is picked up and discussed by 100’s of different podcasts, shows, and other “reporters”.   By the time Florio backtracks on the original reporting, it’s already too late. I think it was Mark Twain who said, “A lie can travel half way around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes.” Unfortunately that problem has only gotten worse with the internet.
It really just shows that Florio is an overdramatic fraud who just makes things up for clicks. There are actual insiders who get real info, but for every one of those there are a dozen Florio fraud types.
And come week one Mac will be the guy under center for the Patriots just like what was always going to happen
Doesn't matter. Zappe is going to beat Mac out in camp.
Nah anyone who has 2 brain cells to rub together knows that all of the rumors are probably 99.8% bullshit.  It's always been like that.
"Prattling" is the main thing I'm taking from this article. Thank you awful announcing lol
Nah we just gotta start grading these guys like we would the players. Put an accuracy percentage or something that shows how often they are wrong or make shit up with each insider.
More like pats fanbase is large and people want to lie to get clicks any way they can.
Can the season just start already? I'm tired of this.
With very few exceptions, all athletes get traded/released eventually. Is there "tension" between Jones and Belichick? Probably. A young starting QB chafing against the system he's in and the crusty old coach probably aren't drinking buddies. There's probably some tension between every QB and their coach in the league. This is all to say all this speculation is probably true in some way, but it's too vague to be substantial. I said "probably" so many times because most of these are universal truths.   These insiders can always go the Obi Wan Kenobi route to defend themselves and say, "What I said was true, from a certain point of view."   What I wish is that Schefter and Florio would say something so egregiously bad that they're fired, but Schefter/Haskins proved that's just not possible. Everyone is outraged for a day, and then we move on to the next controversy.
I mean, I think Mac Jones is going to be a very good qb in the nfl. Those rumors that Belichick was shopping him around made no sense.
Saga? It's Florio, of course is was bullshit the whole time.
We could literally help solve a small part of this problem by not allowing twitter posts on this sub. Ever. At all.  For the love of god and all that is holy, ~~my anus is bleeding~~ please stop posting twitter.
Adam Schefter is the most annoying one, I don’t know how that dude sleeps at night with shit he does. He just seems like an asshole who doesn’t care about anything else but the story.
What if r/nfl posted ratings for each news reporter?   You put out a decent, sourced, credible story? +1  You put out a speculation piece with no appropriate sourcing and have it dismantle an entire sub? -1  Would be interesting to see how it would shake out for who gets the highest score
The simple fact that we're referring to it as "insiderdom" just proves how stupid this all is.  There shouldn't have to be a separate word to describe a journalist getting information from a source.   A good portion of modern day journalists just cruise Reddit and Twitter all day long trying to identify hot topics and the majority hive opinions of them.  Then they write something that falls in line with that and that gets their clicks, views, and engagement.
So two days of half assed news is a saga now? Lol
If you had to wait until Mac Jones to know this, then your eyes have been closed for a long time.  I know it's far from the first occurence, but last year's OBJ cycle also demonstrated this. There were a handful of teams he was definitely going to sign with (DAL, BUF and KC come to mind.) And here we are, all the way through the 2022 season and well in to the start of the 2023 season and he's still unsigned.   There are countless other examples of this.
Of course it's broken. Just generate clicks for revenue.  You could put out an article that says that Josh McDaniels thinks garlic aioli is too spicy and people would somehow speculate that that meant he was moving Devante Adams to move up in the first round of the draft to go after a QB.
Outside of The Atlantic and a few Ringer journalists, the rest of em suck ass
Football only runs for about 5 months a year. But guys like florio have to pay bills every month.
Fuck Florio, the wankee
It’s almost like the news wants to post salacious and misleading stories for clicks?
Just filter out twitter posts on reddit
“Mr. Florio, are your ‘sources’ in the room with us, right now?”
anyone who believes florio at this point is a goof. dude spent like 2 years talking about how tom brady was doing anything and everything he could to get out of tampa and get to the dolphins lmao
Maybe some accountability would help?  Yeah, I know! Crazy idea considering the world we live in.
I mean….half the front page of /r/nfl is Ari Meirov. Let’s not pretend like we didn’t do this to ourselves.
How about it’s social media’s fault and there’s no going back?
The whole world went and got themselves obsessed with clicks and fame.
I feel like there's been so much smoke with Mac for so long now that there's probably SOMETHING there. I doubt they're actively shopping him but there's probably tension.
Trade him to Minnesota for Kirk.
That’s the fun part, it always was.
A couple things have come to light after all this stupidity in the media:   1. Not even New England wants to see Mac Jones start in the NFL  2. People want Belichick to be bullied into retirement  3. The Patriots are a now a media punching bag after falling from contention 3 years ago
Just par for the course just like how the niners are tied to every QB
gotta have unabashed hot takes to feed the algorithm that gets clicks on your articles.
True not true, who cares. Patriots are stuck with a mediocre quarterback.
I hate sympathizing with the Patriots but I could not agree more.
it’s not insiderdom here, it’s an aggregator/speculator getting the two confused
Jones looking older than Belichick in the thumbnail
This would only surprise someone who thinks the insiders motivations are working to keep us accurately informed.  Their priorities are to get engagement (often by sensationalism) and to keep their relationships with those who feed them the stories (often by promoting their agendas).
The best thing that could happen is those "journalists" losing their inside sources when they repeatedly screw up and cause drama rushing for clicks.
The consequences are non-existent because whoever has the spiciest take is the one who gets aggregated. Driving traffic to their sites is all that any of these reporters care about. And since it's sports, there's no real life consequences other than annoying people like Bill Belichick so it's not like this is going to change any time soon.
I don't want to start unnecessary shit, but doesn't this very sub deserve some blame here? So much of the content here is tweet posts, and the first to post gets the karma. Followers of the sub are incentivized to post a tweet as soon as it's available, and the mods have set it up so that this type of content is one of a very few that's acceptable. r/NFL is very large and legitimately drives traffic back to the original tweet/post and thus to the originator's site. So journalists are now incentivized to post things that quickly grab attention.  There are many other outlets like r/NFL that do the same thing. It's not just here. I guess what I'm saying is, maybe it's time to take a critical look at the sub's submission rules to see if it's really the best way for NFL fans on reddit to engage with the sport.
To the point that even random people with a small following because of a team will do the same thing just for the views and likes. The Titans have several Twitter “reporters” who have said random shit with “per my source” attached like that makes it true.
Literally look under Jason La Canfora's tweets on any given rumor he "scoops." It's a running joke. Yet there he is.  Like Major League umpires. Everybody knows the terrible ones, but there are never any real consequences. The one thing I can't fully understand is that unlike MLB umps, there is no steadfast union protecting them and allowing them to be terrible.
The big problem is that a lot of these “journalists” try to say they’re not journalists, they’re just media personalities/content creators. This is what’s dangerous, as they act like a journalist when it’s convenient, but then when they get something wrong don’t need to be held accountable
Especially when any and everyone claims or tries to be an insider
Benjamin Albright simulator lol. Hacks needs to lose clicks.
Pretty much this combined with purposeful misinformation. It seems like the news cycle in general, especially the sports world tries way to hard to be the first to break the story instead of being right. Thus it makes it harder to trust the word of sports journalists who break a story and then have to retract it about a day to two later. But then again the NFL specifically hasn't helped because they will use them purposely to manipulate and mislead things during contract negotiations, draft day picks, and stuff. Off-season is the worst time to follow sports news for the NFL because of all the purposeful misdirection and deceit.
im gonna go off of this and add that journalism as an industry has taken a massive hit in the US. very few are dedicated to unbiased information. people complain about news channels/big media but journalists right now are just as guilty.
I am immediately skeptical of any report with unnamed sources. Too many “reporters” have been caught lying or getting tricked recently for me to put any stock in an anonymous source
You'd think Shefter would be donzo after the whole Bruce Allen thing, but nope, nothing happened.
Seeing as how this is just entertainment it should have never been taken anymore seriously than the Kardashians or something of that ilk.
If you’re going to punish journalists for incorrect information, then you need to punish coaches for straight up lying to the media they’re contractually obligated to speak to
Journalists for every subject are fucking awful these days. They don’t fact check and they don’t even proofread. They know they can half ass things and not be held accountable.
So we are now all in agreement MSM makes stuff up from sports to politics right?
I would say that another big problem is that all of the media are using themselves and each other for content. That is why there are no consequences. Anytime something is said by anyone in the industry they can turn it into a full day's worth of content on their platforms. If they were interested in accuracy this would police itself and eventually filter out the "insiders" who are repeatedly wrong. They just are not interested in being accurate, only in generating content to fill empty space in tv/radio/websites etc.
I love sports. Have been, and will always be, a lifelong fan of the NBA and NFL, but sometimes it blows me away how big of a deal people and the media make out of it. These 24/7 insiders are the perfect manifestation of this. Sports media is exhausting and like 90% of it is totally pointless too.
Modern sports Journalism in a nutshell.   “The patriots MIGHT be willing to move off Mac Jones revealed by “sources”. -Rando Journalist”  Whew, I’ve done my job today.
Hard to penalize someone who runs their own business, brings in tons of revenue for their parent company based on their clickbait, and the lack of having sources in the first place means they never actually lose any.
Yeah. Being wrong is just a normal thing that plenty of "journalists" take advantage of
On the other hand, I feel like social media has created a much higher demand for content. The fact of the matter is that even in a league with as many things going on as the NFL, sometimes they're just isn't anything actually interesting to report. But media wants to keep generating clicks and engagement so publishing nonsense is probably better from their end compared to waiting for actual news. They keep writing this stuff because we keep reading it.
Social media journalism has basically ruined sports reporting. You can fire off a baseless tweet and generate headlines for a week without ever going through an editor or source verification.
It's because sports journalism isn't journalism; it's just another facet of the entertainment product. You watch the broadcast to enjoy the game, and then watch the coverage to enjoy the metagame. It's all one product, even if it's from multiple vendors.  It's not a coincidence that when real news happens in sports, like the sexual harassment scandal inside the Redskins organization, it wasn't the sports reporters that broke it, it was the real reporters at the Washington Post.
the Stephen A Smith/Skip Bayless style of journalism is more profitable but is a joke to any type of actual thoughtful analysis   even more analytical spaces do things for shock now, financial incentives ruin everything
>  "journalists" that repeatedly post untrue or biased stories.  So.....insiderdom
Journalism as a whole has just gotten terrible.   It's a lot easier to see with sports because people aren't as political invested in it but it's to the point where when a story breaks, regardless of what the story is about, I always wonder just how true it even is.  It's easy to be cynical and say it was always like that but it wasn't.  Journalists - be it sports, politics, or local news - used to live by their reputations.  It was better to be late and accurate then early and wrong.  Of course that was back when people subscribed to newspapers and magazines.  They weren't counting on "clicks" and courting controversy for them.
They only do it because fans can't help themselves. it's essentially Fox News/CNN, people eat the bullshit, therefore it's profitable.
There should be a site that tracks the accuracy percentages of these “reporters”.  Some we all know are pretty reliable like Woj for example. But if there was a poor rating for certain reporters then I’d assume their views would slowly go down and that would be their punishment. Low credibility.
This is true of all major journalism now, not just sports journalism
The journalists are there to generate clicks, not the truth.
It’s up to us not to buy in from semi-journalists like Florio
Journalism as a whole is broken. When it specifically comes to the NFL through, I only pay attention to Shef.
And this article does nothing to recommend any changes. The author admits to being a part of the problem and then adding to the mess by calling out guys for doing exactly what he did.
Shefter can literally lie about something and Espn will still have him on speaking on something else like it’s breaking news. I really don’t believe these journalists are trusted by a majority of players and coaches which may be why they seems to be wrong all the time
The problem is you can't prove it's untrue  Even if one source says they heard it another who hasn't can just say it's not true  How many athletes just say "Not true fake news" when the story portrays them negatively even if the story is actually true.
Every NFL Draft mocker fitd this mold.
My dad (with 35+ years of journalism experience) would have fired so many of them.
If Fox "News" can get away with telling lies on TV for years, journalists on Twitter are basically risk-free.
The consequences are losing your sources and being ignored by fans.
If you think this is bad, think for a moment about real industries where opinion actually matters, like the financial markets. “Research institutes” that are actually short sellers in disguise load up on short positions and then release bs reports that trash companies. As soon as the news breaks and the price of the stock declines, they close their positions for a profit. Then the company responds saying the report is completely false, and the stock rebounds.  The NFL’s fake news cycle is small game compared to the financial industry.
I love how he complained about reporters, turning the rumor mill, in an article that does the SAME THING!
Hi. I suffered through 2 years of DeflateGate. I'd like my money back, please.
Let’s keep stats on em. If they post a tweet, under it they should post an accuracy average.  If I can look up and find that Wade Boggs had a batting average of .368 in 1985, I want to know Schefters tweet accuracy from 2021.   Only fair.
They should have stat recording of insiders. They can have a completion percentage for successful news drops and we can award an MVP of news Insiders each year.
>Florio claimed he’s only written about [anything, ever, really, except maybe very specific legal language] in a “vague, loose way.”
This is why you pay your local papers and trust your beat guys. Beat guys always have the national dudes beat!
Felger was rambling after the Florio story, saying how dysfunctional Belichick is.  Then someone called in to say another insider just debunked Florio, Felger just straight up said “I do not believe that” and continued to make shit up about Belichick and Mac.  I NEVER listen to sports talk radio, so I just happened to catch this interaction in a 10 minute car ride with a friend.  Jesus Christ how do people listen to this trash?  Felger is an absolute idiot.
>>That’s what happened to Ben Volin, the Boston Globe’s national NFL writer.  "*Who is Ben Volin*?"  - Michael Holley
>After all, there is so much time to fill. There’s destined to be a lot of hot air.  If I were the grand dictator of the world, I'd probably end the 24/7 news cycle and say you can only share news between 4 and 7 PM.  This wouldn't be taken well because it clearly works to my advantage, and I'd be overthrown.   But I still maintain that the 24/7 news cycle is what's wrong with politics, sports, business, and probably my cankles.
>In 24 hours, Florio went from writing that a source told him Belichick has “shopped Jones to multiple teams” to saying that he doesn’t know whether Belichick was “really serious” about trading his young QB.  I have no idea what Florio heard/was told/based this on/made up but these are in no way contradictory
Why are they very different statements. You can shop for something without being serious about it
It's funny because Chris Simms kept saying this didn't doesn't sound like Bill at and the story didn't track when talking to him.   Tom Curran immediately texted him and asked wtf are you doing?? Who's your source on this. (But talked to Florio on his podcast anyway).
Holy shit. What a joke.  We should start calling Florio “Mike from West Virginia,” as he’s basically late night sports talk radio caller whose had 2 drinks.
Florio is the king of absolutely ridiculous speculation passed off as information or intended to be perceived as news. The only thing worse than his "reporting" is his "analysis". He put together a very good news aggregation website specific to NFL football but he thinks he can add something to others' reporting for some reason. Anything he trys to report directly or pass off as analysis should be 100% ignored.
Simms and Florio are truly awful people.
the inclusion of that story about some other boston reporter who has nothing to do with this story smacks of desperation  same with what they call 'very different statements' by florio. he said they were shopping him, that just means getting a sense of his trade value, it's not 'really serious' trade negotiations and he didn't present it like that. they're trying way too hard to attack his credibility
Bill should beat him up.
What is a Stoolie?
BAN MIKE FLORIO
> But as it turns out, the DM was a lie. He was fooled by a Stoolie. >  >   absolute comedy LOL
Fuck Florio for this whole thing. I now have to hear about this forever because people are actually taking what he said as gospel and not actually reading what's going on.
They're known for going to or getting close to the Super Bowl every year and now that they haven't gone that far people pretend the Patriots organization is a dumpster fire. While the truth is, it takes time to rebuild.
Also the last 3 years haven’t even been bad, just aggressively mid. Going .500 during a rebuild is pretty good for anyone not named the Patriots
Hell we were getting these reports during the dynasty years.
They were doing it for at least 10 years before, but no one really noticed because most of them were clearly fake. They didn't get much drama out of the team, there wasn't much performance to criticize, and belichick wouldn't give them anything. So, they mastered the practice of just generating rumors. They realized that they could make up shit, and then other journalists would react to it and no one would hold them accountable when they were wrong. Now that the team isn't an auto-lock for an AFCCG appearance, this shit actually gets traction
ppl act like the drama with this franchise is all some big fabrication, that's it's just biased journalists taking advantage of their drop off  it was reported their was a rift between brady and belichick, it was called lies and clickbait. then brady left.  it was reported there was tension between jones and the coaching staff. ripped as lies and clickbait. then cameras catch jones screaming at patricia multiple times   it was reported there was discussion about zappe overtaking jones the starter. lies and clickbait again right? mccourty retires and says some guys in the locker room wanted zappe to start
what's crazy is he employed Matt Patricia a defensive failure to coach the offense that was also an offensive failure, so yeah there's that, but sure stays the night at the facility and all that so he's probably good
> Zero chance Kraft ever pressures Bill to leave.  The Mac trade rumors were bs, but there's enough smoke from the local reporters there's something remiss in the relationship between BB and Kraft. Ask anyone following the team  if this is Bill's last year here, while it would be surprising, it wouldn't be shocking.   For instance, Kraft forcing a PR announcement of hiring an HC, keeping Mayo, saying at the owners meetings he wants Mayo to be an HC. These things didn't happen in the past. There's also enough reporting to substantiate that Kraft is upset he went with Bill over Tom.
I would even take it a step further and say that they’re just downright monotonous.
or if you give a fuck, do it knowing that you should take it with a grain of salt and don't get outraged and mad over it being wrong lol
Pats fans love to "legitimize" clear rumors with the Brady leaving saga. For years there was baseless stories about Brady trying to leave and hating Bill but those stories were clearly false. Then he finally leaves as amicably as he could, and everyone points at the clickbait and says "see they knew the whole time!"
I almost never buy into these dumb reports. Last year when there were rumblings that AJ Brown had potential to be traded I wrote it off, and then it happened.   Ya never know.
Most of them are true though. They generally come from agents talking to reporters to get stories out there for their players.
There's been reports like this about Mac since Fall last year though
The whole point of this article was its more than just Florio, it’s an institutional problem in the NFL/sports journalism in general
When did we transition away from water being wet? Can we go back to that?
At some point it comes down to us, the consumers, to make these jokes cut their crap out. Instead everyone flocks to agrigator sites even in the off season like addicts looking for a sensational hit (I'm also part of the problem admittedly)
Lol seriously we’ve all known that Florio is a hack for the last decade and to steer clear of pretty much any breaking news outside of a like handful of reliable guys + dependable local guys for each team. This isn’t something new but of course we decide that “NFL Insiderisn is Broken” after it affects the Patriots and their Boston media mafia.
Ok but this mindset is exactly what causes the problem. This story got run across NFL media for weeks and had to be disproven multiple times. A lot of us understand Florio is a hack, but we just silently ignore and move on. It's what lets these journalists make shit up and run it.
I've been hearing the same from my source at 345 Park Avenue.
They used to take pride in it because that's what made them the most money. Nowadays that ain't so true anymore.
No they haven’t, we had yellow journalism from the late 1800s. New York World and New York Journal battling it out in the race to the bottom. It was one of the reasons why the Spanish American War happened.
Ehhhhhh.  Tabloids have been around as long as newspapers, and even reputable newspapers printed all kinds of insane bullshit (particularly pre-internet where nobody was fact checking).  The problem is more that there are the equivalent of sports tabloids that get treated as actual sports journalism.
It's because the incentives are all messed up.    They could take the time to check their sources, double back, make sure to watch their words carefully, and watch as they get beaten to scoops and lose job opportunities.    Or they can say bombastic things and write using vague terms and get clicks and thus more and more cash.
They used to take pride because if they didn’t they were fired and disgraced.   There are no consequences now.
Summer practice reports aren't new.  If be more surprised if you didn't see them
There's plenty of stories and reporting about the draft, scouting reports, team building. But people upvote the fake rumors they want to believe
I always downvote and report everything from Florio that I see on this sub
Yup. Even just talking about these "reporters" who peddle in bullshit *feeds into exactly what they want*. They don't care that you're shitting on them, because you probably had to read their article or watch their video or listen to their radio segment to even know that you should be shitting on them. And the more they're talked about, the more it amplifies their bullshit and eventually finds its way to looney toons who believe every word.
It's not the fans' job to discern the truth from the lies.  In fact it is impossible for us to tell the difference.
We are *entirely* responsible for it. You think this is what these reporters want to be doing with their lives? No way. But they know what we want to read, so they give it to us.
It’s social media that’s destroyed sports journalism. Anyone with a friend or connection to a team or player can break news first. Or just make stuff up and there’s no repercussions for them. Their sources were “just off base”   So now guys that used to be legit (not saying florio. I’ve seen it more with shefter) have to start either trying to get out in front of stuff, or scoop stuff, which leads to unverified reporting or just outright presenting rumors or rumblings as fact before checking.
How did he betray the pats?
True for just about any successful team in any sport, and especially so for a dynasty. Definitely doesn’t help that y’all are a huge fan base AND in a big media market.
It's all cope. It makes people feel better about what the Pats did to believe they were cheating. It makes people feel better about what the Pats did to believe they're a dumpster fire destined for failure for the next 50 straight years. Couple this with entitled <30 yo Pats fans who's expectations start and end with Lombardi trophies stoking the fires from the inside of the fanbase and you get what we have now.
Tell me you are a Pats fan without telling me.
Exactly, people want to believe the fake news, the media gives their customers what they want, no different than fox news.
whats funny is new england fans on this site were huge supporters of florio years ago bc he was ripping the league for how they handled deflategate, particularly in comparison to the number of high profile domestic violence cases  but now bc he says something that they don't like he's public enemy #1 and they're all sure he's full of shit even though they ppl they're relying on to 'contradict' him are using the same 'unnamed sources say' evidence
Deflategate was real enough that Brady got suspended. That’s fair game to cover.
the same ppl who will whine if someone posts a paywalled article  zero awareness
Yeah the same rumors this article is criticizing are always on the front page here
Is it the same redditors? There's over 3 million people on this sub.
Florio was wrong because he said the Pats were shopping Mac with teams x, y and z.  &#x200B;  Reports then came out that teams x, y and z never had contact with the Pats
Yep. 20 years ago, 30 years ago it would be some local radio host or beat writer conjuring up an elaborate story based on the rumor of a rumor.   Social media and tech in general just made it more accessible.   I'm not gonna get pissed off because Florio went a little wild a time or two with a whisper of a truth.
lol that's not really true but even if it were whose fault is that? start with the ppl clicking on that 'clickbait' and refusing to subscribe to publications that don't rely on clicks
Brady will come out of retirement and play for the Dolphins apparently.
We also have to take into consideration that the players in the nba have almost all of the power. When a player wants something to happen it most likely will.
yea the response to florio's report is like billy shakespeare's 'the lady doth protestest too much methinks'  why is everyone so defensive about this? we talk about players getting shopped around all the time. much better players than mac jones  new england fans are doing a victory lap and getting on a soapbox about the 'state of journalism' bc two nobodies reported that their unnamed sources disagree with florio's report. that's it. no evidence by them either but somehow this proves journalism is 'broken'? lmao
article explained it well
The issue is reporters contradicting themselves.   It'd be one thing if a reporter committed to a story/take and others contradicted them. But reporting something as fact and then 48 hours later claiming you never meant it that way is quite frankly bullshit.
I knew it was false due to BoB joining the Pats. ~~He was Mac’s coordinator in Alabama~~. I would assume BB wants to at least run with Mac with BoB for one season.
Because it's not plausible, and there's no evidence of it? In fact there's evidence of the opposite?
> I don't think it's super outlandish that Bill Belichick called up a couple of GMs and said "what would you give me for Mac Jones?" in the hopes that someone would give multiple firsts as a massive overpay, and then nobody was biting so he's keeping Jones as the QB.  I do, this would be an awful time to try that trade, especially after you got BOB as new offense coach
Modern “journalism” bothers me way more than it should. It’s fucking slimy. Depending on the author and type of news I more than likely immediately discount it as false.  Not even football related. I can’t imagine the amount of shitty information younger generations are exposed to.
Plus when florio is more knowledgeable than 99 percent of redditors
No, Ben Volin was not in the market back then. You are thinking of John Tomase. While he and his newspaper apologized for the false report, he was actually promoted to cover the Red Sox. He is still a part of the Boston sports media today. It goes to show that there are zero consequences to these actions and why sports media, especially in the Boston area has little to no credibility.
I’d put money that won’t happen
Zappe got dominated by the Bears defense lol, the only things he's beating Jones at is holding a clipboard
Then they would just find new “sources”
Part of the problem is, it works.  If there’s a post from someone you don’t trust, no matter how curious you are, don’t click through. If it’s shared here, downvote it.  We can help curb the influence of these trash sources by not giving into their games.
That's assuming their sources are even real people. I bet the large majority of content in sports media is just fabricated from nothing.
I mean is there anyone verifying sources? Like if I told Florio a hot take, could he just use me as a source? Who’s to say anyone’s sources are credible other than if their news comes to fruition?
>when they repeatedly screw up and cause drama rushing for clicks.  This isn't what's happening. They aren't "rushing for clicks" and making stuff up. They are repeating what they're being told by those sources. Every time you hear a story from an "insider," what you're hearing is what a source *wanted* you to hear. It would make no sense for any of those sources to stop talking to journalists, because the journalists are providing them with a service.
The problem with that is that it's mutually beneficial to some extent. Front offices can feed info to reporters as a smokescreen or even to find out where their leaks are if critical stuff has been getting out. There's no real consequences to the teams if media figures are just making shit up for clicks, so why would they cut off potentially useful assets? The only time I can remember a reporter being an actual problem was Manish Mehta and even then that was for WAY more than just publishing baseless conjecture.
I’m all for assholes getting blacklisted out of the industry.
How much of it is made up vs someone giving them that info though? Everyone has an agenda…I don’t envy the people in the spotlight who have to make that decision honestly. Everyone in the business is peddling half truths to try and spin something their way.
Who says they're screwing up from the sources perspective. I strongly suspect Patricia is behind lots of this.  Sources are rarely out for just the truth. Sometimes they tell the truth because they think something wrong is being done or someone isn't getting credit or want to feel powerful or want the reporter to owe them. Sometimes they're spinning or lying for similar reasons.
Or hear me out. We stop listening to the guys who r wrong. Like...crazy idea here....we dont click on articles from people who completely lie to us. Who hold them accountable. It might work, who knows!
This is a social media problem. "DRiving traffic" is the ONLY fucking metric any of these sociopathic companies care about. Truth doesn'te ven enter into the equation.   NONE of these guys are ever going to face consequences because their BS takes they made up out of their own asshole "drives engagement" and as such its deemed a success even it its nothing but lies.
In reality, the only way to really start shutting these assholes out would be to start firing the people that leak the information.
Nah, the consequences are non-existent because these guys are all doing exactly what they were paid to do. Remember, as heftier not only calls the league before running stories, he was also the guy who claimed Deshaun Watson was “innocent”, then had to dance around the tweet while waiting for NFL approval to walk it back.  There is ZERO separation between the media and the NFL, and they’re literally getting away with sex trafficking on behalf of their employees because of it (yes, the Houston Texans *knowingly* engaged in sex trafficking along with another woman who would find victims for Watson, and they all had them signing NDAs, according the NYT).
If the nfl and teams cared they could punish it. For example, Florio being reckless could potentially influence teams to reduce access for his more legit colleagues at NBC and affiliated programs. That would fix things real quick
Exactly this. Every single Meirov thread has comments like "why do we still allow Meirov here" and yet there's no feedback, no recourse.
Not to mention Meirov and Kleiman posts get pushed to the top regularly. It does seem like there is a bias in who gets posts promoted.
That's part of the exhaustion. Yes.
Really strange how tweets about what sandwich someone ate gets hundreds of upvotes.
> and the first to post gets the karma  lol except 90% of the time mods remove posts from "non-trusted posters" so only a few accounts get to karma farm. No conspiracy I'm sure.
You make a good point but nobody on here (to my knowledge) is paid for the likes and clicks they generate. Nobody's professional integrity will be marred by anonymously  posting stuff on Reddit.
This sub is one of the biggest reflections of the problem for sure, hard to say if we cause it or are just swept up in the clickbait. Both probably
We're certainly not part of the solution, but nobody takes reddit seriously.
Need a tier system like /r/soccer
>	I am immediately skeptical of any report with unnamed sources.  This is literally how all of journalism works. If you think anonymous sources shouldn’t be a thing journalism as a whole would cease to exist.
It’s the Blind Squirrel Theorem and the same reason draft experts keep doing different mocks.  Eventually they can say “I actually had Player X going to the Patriots in one of my 62 mock drafts!”
Rumors. That’s what rumors are. That’s what create drama. People eat that up. So the insiders are more than happy to provide that. Especially when there are essentially zero set boundaries or consequences.
It's the lawyer in him, when he gets called out he'll try and split hairs and play games with words to pretend he was actually right all along  his smug, confident wrongness is what makes him even worse than your average bullshitter
Dude probably wrote his 5th grade book reports in a “vague, loose way.”
There are times when someone will specifically quote an on the record statement from Tom Brady, or Belichick, or someone else affiliated with the team that doesn't go along with the Felger and Mazz narrative. Felger and Mazz then simply claim that they are lying.
It's actually really interesting (in a terrible way) listening to how unfounded rumors and "it must have been like this" becomes truth through being constantly spewed on sports talk radio. You'll hear people talk about Malcolm Butler in the SB or Brady's departure or recent coaching decisions as if they know exactly why and how everything happened, and then if you dig even slightly it's all just "come on, everyone knows it, it's obvious." And oh by the way the explanation *always* happens to be either the juiciest or most unflattering for someone, usually Bill (but sometimes other targets).   If you know the narratives it's actually pretty easy to figure out when someone you're talking with listens, since they'll come up with braindead takes like "Bill actually held Brady back." But that shit drives ratings, so I guess we're stuck with it.
I actively like sports less because of what that jackhole has done to the conversation in this town. Being a fan is less fun than it used to be.
I got downvoted in the Pats sub calling those two clowns absolute trash radio. People were like, "appreciate it for what it is - entertainment."  Sorry, but those two morons are the least entertaining people I've ever listened to.
It's rage bait, simple as that. Radio has been a basically hopeless business venture unless you have a remarkably engaged audience, and the best way to get sports fans engaged is to piss them off
My dad and brother both listen to bsoton sports radio all day while working then come home and watch it on TV. I'm convinced my Dad is dumber than he was 20 years ago. Both must have mush for brains listening to Felger and Maz every day.
Him and Maz are terrible. They exist solely to shit on the local teams and be contrarian.
People listen to Mark Madden, *consistently and with approval*. After that, nothing surprises me.
Michael Holley was the one who coined "Ben Trollin'"
Still not the funniest time a Boston sports personality got duped. A K&C listener getting Ron Borges to believe he was speaking to Don Yee about the Brady/Jimmy G situation and Borges publishing it is top tier hilarity.
Here's the thing, if you actually believed your "source", then you would know he was serious about trading him because you trust that source. Backtracking and saying you don't actually believe what you reported is kind of nuts. Why bother reporting shit you don't even think is true? That last question is rhetorical, we all know why it's just really annoying and lacks any integrity you would expect from a journalist or media member.
The amount of flack Florio gets from people who just lack reading comprehension is unreal.  Meanwhile in that same article we have a guy falling for a Stoolie prank and there's barely a word about it here and thats way worse imo
Yeah, the two statements really don't contradict each other. It could be Belichick shopped Jones but made it clear he would only move him for multiple first-round picks. So it's true that Belichick was talking to other teams about trading Jones, but it's also true that Belichick was more fishing to see what kind of offers might be possible than really eager to move him.
Yeah 3 years of being mediocre, but the way the media spins it you’d think we’ve only won a total of 4 games in the past 3 years.
> t takes time to rebuild.  Especially after losing two longtime offensive cornerstones in Brady and then McDaniels. Bill is also getting up there in age. I dont care how good you are, you're just not going to be as sharp when you're 60+
Bengals had the first pick and two later were in the Super Bowl and now a perennial contender. It’s about to be year 4 post Brady and the patriots are nowhere near that. Plus, the patriots starting point for their “rebuild” was a wild card loss and afc East championship. They haven’t been awful but their ceiling with belichick is a 10-11 win season and a wild card berth.
This might be shocking to you, but it's possible that some reports were true while many were BS.  Also, brady leaving is not sure evidence that he had a rift with BB lol
The rift between brady and belichick was clickbait, because the stories had been running for like 10 years at that point. And since then, the two have said nothing but positive things about eachother.
"Most"  Uh, no they aren't around this time.
The issue is that a ton of programs and podcasts discuss this rumor that Florio just kind of made up. It's the fact that major programs treat these rumors as legitimate developments.  I said this in another Florio post, at this time of year I think people prefer fake news to no news.
no because reddit pedants will instantly be like 🤓 actually water is not wet since it is the cause of making things wet 🤓
As soon as you can show me how to light a fire on fire. Or dirty up some dirt.
I don’t think you actually read a word of the article but ok lmao. What a weird take. Like you agreed with the premise of the article in your first sentence then somehow blamed it on Boston.
Boston media mafia? Is that you, Donald Trump? lmao
Who’s we, his posts are on top of the sub every day
“Take pride” may have been the wrong choice of words. It’s more that reputation meant something if you wanted to be successful.
Hell, we have a founding father who owned the Pennsylvania Gazette mostly so he could write anonymous letters to the editor (himself) shit-talking fellow Philly socialites.
Yeah breaking news, people have always lied
Yes, but there's a lot of time in-between the 1890s and now.  The fairness doctrine, from 1949 to 1987, required journalists to report differing viewpoints fairly.  On top of the legal aspect, it put honesty in journalism on a pedestal and made it the focus for young journalists.
True, but still different.  The real issue is that in the 21st century, anyone can reach millions of people within milliseconds with all kinds of lies- at 0 cost.  Even the most ambitious yellow papers had a limit scope and reach. It still took time for falsehoods to propagate and reach people.  Digital media has amplified the problem enormously. You can have some random guy spread one lie to millions of people, another guy spreads a different lie, and soon enough no one knows what real anymore and its ever harder to disentangle reality from fiction.  TLDR: people havent changed but the platforms have
Sure, but last summer was weird like I hadn't seen before.   "Soandso looked shitty this morning, only went 3-8" quickly followed up with "Nevermind, fine in the afternoon. Went 8-9" was just weird. I don't think we need that level of granularity.
That's like 2-3 steps closer to legitimate than what this post is talking about
This is the way dawg
He went outside the organization for help with contacting Bama for help given how inept our OCs were lastyearand even BB himself.. The hosts call him a snake now...
Only Pats fans seem to care about paying attention to the truth vs the yellow journalism
I can praise someone for being in the right while later condemn them for being in the wrong. That isn’t hypocrisy. How is ripping the league for a bullshit conspiracy and investigation at all the same as rumormongering and click baiting.
When one person says one thing, and 10 other more trusted people say another, people dont trust the liar. Let me know how I can make it easier for you to understand.  Edit: never mind you’re the guy from the first thread who only argues against strawmen. Don’t respond to me I dont want to deal with you again
> but now bc he says something that they don't like he's public enemy #1 and they're all sure he's full of shit even though they ppl they're relying on to 'contradict' him are using the same 'unnamed sources say' evidence  No, he's public enemy number 1 because he contradicted himself and all the actual reliable sources and actual reporters debunked him.   He can be a shit reporter and still have pointed out how dumb the deflategate coverage was.   He still should, given there was zero media coverage over the revelation that it was all a sham
Brady was suspended for being insubordinate. His refusal to turn over his cell phone to the league office pissed them off so they came up with a flimsy reason to suspend him. Goodell said as much in the appeal judgement.
No, the trial found Brady not guilty. The NFL appealed and said "guilty or not, evidence or not, it is within our authority to punish anyone for anything", and they won that. It was a huge fucking deal and set precedent to give them basically unlimited power over the players and the only people that seemed to care was the players union, but no one cared about the players union.
Are you suggesting Reddit isn’t an echo chamber filled with people who parrot fiction as fact, or just outright make things up to seem more knowledgeable?  I always hate this response. Or the “well I’ve never seen that here!”   I’d say 80-90% of the people here are guilty of what he’s saying. Come on. You’d have to have blinders on to pretend like you don’t know what he’s talking about.
Exactly, if you did not hear the local shock jock or missed an article that was it, you missed the BS story. With social media, these national stories can become local stories and local rumors can become national stories.
"blame the consumers for my shitty product, they keep buying this garbage"
The article comes across as salty  because they don't like Florio or don't like the report.  This is how sports media works. A journalist reports something, then fans & pundits talk about it on TV & radio for weeks on end for entertainment purposes. Nothing's broken, it's the entire point of sports media.
where did florio contradict himself?  he said belichick 'has shopped' jones. never said a trade was imminent or discussions were happening  asked about it again he said he wasn't sure if it was 'really serious' or not  shopping a player in pro sports is not a 'really serious' thing. happens all the time. it's like kicking the tires  one of the two writers nobody outside of new england has ever heard of who supposedly 'disproved' these rumors said his unnamed sources said they weren't 'shopping' jones. but that's present tense, florio referred to these events in the past tense
now wait a second--we can't fault journalists for trying to report the most up-to-date information they have access to. If they change their reporting it means that stronger or newer information has replaced it.
> I knew it was false due to BoB joining the Pats. He was Mac’s coordinator in Alabama.  Except this is completely false. Mac Jones' last game at Alabama was on January 11, 2021: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_College_Football_Playoff_National_Championship  Bill O'Brien was hired at Alabama on January 21, 2021: https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/30755618/alabama-crimson-tide-hires-bill-obrien-offensive-coordinator-quarterbacks-coach  Not trying to pick on you personally, but it's funny to me how often on Reddit people are like, "I know this journalist is wrong because [factually incorrect statement]."
You are absolutely right. I got my media idiots confused. They all blend together.
Well not with that attitude.
Like when Ben Volin got got a few months ago. Some rando DMed him with what his "buddy that works in the ticket booth of Gillette Stadium overheard", then turned around and posted the screenshots after Ben Volin ran with it.
they will just make shit up our of their ass even harder!  and we will upvote that shit and discuss it!
Most of them probably aren’t even using sources, they just speculate moves that they believe make sense and then say it’s happening according to sources.
I always say this in these threads  Blaming the journalists for doing what makes people click on things is like blaming a restaurant for putting popular dishes on the menu  Why do people seem to think journalism isn't an industry?
There's mainly three types.  There's the types who are essentially mouthpieces for orgs.  There's the types who are essentially mouthpieces for agents.  Then there's the third type.  Somebody online will make up a rumor, then some journalist will bite on it and cover the rumor as though it were legitimate, then it moves up the media food chain until everybody is reporting on it and no one can cite the original source, no one goes back to recognize that the source was just some rando on the internet.
Exactly. There is no verification that these "sources" are legit and sports news media has no interest in doing something that could pump the breaks on the salacious rumors that drive traffic to their sites. Multiple reporters have questioned the validity of Florio's report since it broke but at that point it was too late.  I said this the other day - in the absence of someone verifying sources you have to judge a story based on the overall track record of the reporter, and we all know Florio has been full of shit for years. He should really be banned from this sub. Guys like Schefter, even if you hate him, have a pretty damn solid record when it comes to breaking stories. Locally to the Patriots, Mike Reiss is the most trustworthy beat reporter there is.
It's "reporters" like Woj or Schefter who act as mouthpieces for franchises. When they aren't being fed insider info they just make shit up the rest of the time.
NBA, but related:  Way back in the day, during the peak of Chris Broussard's "MULTIPLE SOURCES" era, people on the SLAM comment section noticed that he was lurking, taking notes, and then repeating comments verbatim on-air.  Let's just say there was a cadre of fellas that started posting really, really bad takes on purpose, and he regurgitated a few of them on TV.  Good times.
The worst is when other “journalists” pretend their job is noble when all they do is crack jokes about Aaron Rodgers or call teams racist.
Remember that kid in your middle school that had an uncle that works at Nintendo?  Every wonder what happened to him?  He went to college got a degree in Communications and now is an NFL insider doing the same shit he did Toms River Intermediate North
There are a few “reporters” on Twitter that say bullshit reports all the time. Some of them have turned it into blogs with money. One particular dolphin “reporter” has gotten so popular through their lies that they somehow GOT  a source and broke a story this year.   Twitter has made it extremely easy to build a following over BS
In theory an editor is supposed to decide if the use of anonymous sources is appropriate and credible.  But if it's just on your Twitter, then you're reporter and editor so no one is minding the store.
Anonymity is a pretty big deal with things like this because leaks can cost people their jobs and possible get them in legal trouble.
...it's exactly what's happening. No one takes time to vet anything because you gotta rush out to be the first to Tweet about whatever it is.
As far as I know, only the New York Times has successfully transitioned to a subscription rather than an ad-based model, and it was incredibly painful for a long time. Which has made others completely adverse to changing their current practices.   Unless a serious internet privacy law that breaks up ad algorithms is passed, the entire internet will run on a clickbait-to-ad revenue model.
It's not limited to social media. This has existed in print media and TV for a long time. But social media is definitely helping it.
If they're succeeding at driving traffic it means people are choosing to engage with the content, so maybe we are the real problem.
Amen to your first paragraph. That's why pff posts stupid and trolling crap on Twitter that has nothing to do with their business model.
"Driving traffic" means people stop reading them. If the people want to be fed bullshit, how do you stop that?
The metaphor I came up with is like it's a bunch of teachers patting themselves on the back because a huge brawl of students shows just how *engaged* they are in school
Why are publications more sociopathic for wanting to make money than literally any for profit company ever?
I thought it's Dov we have an issue with, not Meirov
Not sure what you mean here.   Users here upvote tweets left and right and routinely report and downvote self posts.   You also haven't seen a Kleiman tweet here for a month.
[Kleiman] Just spoke to Andy Reid, he told me “I like burger”  10k upvotes 20 awards
Except the conspiracy your pulling out of your ass you mean?
I don’t think he’s insinuating anyone is profiting, just how healthy is it for the NFL discussion to allow clickbait twitter posts.
>but nobody takes reddit seriously  Absolutely false, especially in these circumstances. Reddit might be maligned as unserious or whatever, but for businesses that produce content on other platforms, like journalists, Reddit is massively important. I speak from experience, here. In my previous job, we would always see a significant spike in traffic if an article was posted to a popular sub. Journalists, content marketers, SEO marketers (really any marketer) has Reddit as a part of their content distribution plan because they know that the power of Reddit comes from its sheer numbers.
This is a unfortunate side effect of how sports media ruins traditional media.  For a lot of REAL news stories you have to protect your sources, when taking about let’s say a police scandal or government corruption case you can’t go on record, but you can go anonymously.   But we see sports media dudes making shit up and end up not trusting other sources and it makes our lives harder
Not to mention all the vitriol towards a certain reporter when they say they've talked directly to the player.  It's impossible to please people.
I never said anonymous sources shouldn’t be a thing. I said I am immediately skeptical. How did you literally quote me and still misinterpret my comment? Is it too much to ask for a reporter to verify their sources? Too many reporters, especially in Boston media, have had unnamed sources that have turned out to be made up or just some rando pretending to be someone they aren’t.  Ben Volin reported that people in the patriots organization were saying Mac Jones has an attitude problem. Turns out his source was a random stoolie who sent him a DM on twitter.  Ron Borges reported that Brady would sit out of training camp if he didn’t get a deal similar to Jimmy Garoppolo. His source was some random guy who texted him pretending to be Brady’s agent.
That's the fault of journalists who have ran with sources that didn't actually exist to write articles, or providing authority to extremely untrustworthy sources with agendas. If legit reporters are mad about it, then they should be holding their colleagues to a higher standard instead of defending them.
> Eventually they can say “I actually had Player X going to the Patriots in ~~one of~~ my ~~62~~ mock draft~~s~~!”  FTFY. They'd never acknowledge the mock drafts that were wrong, makes them look untrustworthy.
The old version of the PFT site proudly displayed the “bang it here for the rumor mill” link. It’s now labeled “news and rumors” but nothing has really changed… it was always a sewing circle for NFL gossip. Florio just projects legitimacy more than he used to. Still packaging up whatever scraps he’s handed in legal jargon.
To be fair, it also gives BB the ability to have his cake and eat it too. If a QB-needy team calls him with a good deal because of the rumors, he could take it if he were inclined.
It's also carefully crafted so he would be extremely likely to win if he was sued for libel.
I used to keep up with the NFL so closely during the off-season, now I just check back in occasionally to see what moves have been made. After the draft I usually shut it all out until final cuts of preseason and my life has been better for it
Never met a happy person that listened to EEI regularly
Isn't it "Trollin' Volin"?
Has nothing to do with believing the source or not, and Florio didn’t backtrack.   The source says he’s being shopped, Florio reports that, Florio then says he doesn’t know how serious the “shopping” is … OK? That is completely fine and not contradictory.   The ridiculousness is in fan overreaction.
They don't necessarily contradict each other, but the tone of each is quite different. It's not like Florio originally reported, "Rumor has it that Belichick has been shopping Jones, but it's unclear how serious he is about it." His initial report was written with the implication that these were serious trade talks. He didn't even mention that he was unsure of the validity of the offers until a full day later after having already let the initial report run its course.
Even then I feel like every year except last year exceeded expectations. We won 7 games with the ghost of Cam Newton and went to the playoffs with a rookie Mac Jones. Even with how disappointing last year was because of Matt Patricia we still won 8 games. We're not nearly as bad as the media wants us to be.
8-9 Pats = Dumpster fire with no hope.  9-8 Dolphins = The new model for success that everyone should copy.   Why? Because those are the narratives that get clicks.
The media? What about Kraft saying they haven't won a playoff game and he's not happy about it? Kraft sure doesn't seem happy with 7-9 seasons.
Mac jones ain’t Joe burrow. Pretty simple
>Bengals had the first pick and two later were in the Super Bowl and now a perennial contender.  The Bengals also sucked or were mediocre for most of their existence. It took them a very long time to finally get a star franchise QB. Let's not act like the Bengals rebuilt within a year.
In the 5 years leading up to the Bengals making the SB (17-21) they picked higher in every season than we have in 15 years. We've picked top 5 once in the past 30 years.
"perennial contender"  lmfao two years is perennial now  I swear half of r/NFL are high schoolers who started watching in 2020
The Bengals were shit for almost the entirety of Brady’s tenure in New England? We have another 10 years of being bad before we get into Bengals territory.   >	 had the first pick  The Patriots lowest earned pick in 20 years is 14, this year. If we were constantly in the shitter picking the first overall, we’d have different expectations yes
So their rebuild began as soon as they drafted their franchise QB? The fuck are you talking about? The bengals have been a poverty franchise for a loooooong time.
>It's the fact that major programs treat these rumors as legitimate developments.  I forgot the specifics of the situation, but didn't a redditor prove out how somebody from ESPN said something about NFL Player X on Monday Night. Tuesday afternoon comes around and PTI/Around the horn (or some show) is debating what the person said on Monday as an argument people/the media are making. Wednesday morning show brings in 'experts' to discuss whatever was said in Monday/Tuesday, etc.  Like they can literally create an entire story and eco-system for a story based on one talking head opinion or rumor.
both things can be true. water makes things wet. it is also wet itself
Dirt is dirty. Flames are on fire. Water is wet.
There's no way you're trying to say that dirt isn't dirty  Are you?
No I’m not saying that the article is wrong, I’m saying that the premise of “NFL insiderdom being broken” isn’t something new. It’s been broken since the invention of twitter but anyone who isn’t living under a rock already knew that.
Daryl Morey*
This is true, but it has always depended on what the reader wanted. That’s why we have had rags forever that tell people about batkid or whatever.
Reputation still matters for the very top of the profession. It's the mid to low level that has changed. Before it was building local relationships for local stories, working your way up to bigger and wider producers of content (mostly papers and television). Now it's getting the most clicks possible about anything around the world.
It's not even reputation, to be honest.  They just don't care anymore, because of social media.  During the 1980s, Wade Boggs had a mistress named Margo Adams.  She traveled with the team.  Reporters all knew who she was.  Not a single story was written about it until she found out he was fucking other women and went public about the affair whle suing Boggs for palimony.  The reason why nobody wrote a story about it?  Because they were worried about losing their access.  If any reporter wrote a story about it, that would be the last story they would write about the Red Sox, because the players would refuse to talk to them and the team wouldn't have any interest in helping defuse things either.  Similarly, I happened to know that Manny Ramirez was going to be traded a few days before it happened.  The reason I knew is because I knew the reporter who dug up the story.  The reason why he wasn't allowed to publish is because the year before, the outlet that he works for had erroneously reported that Tedy Bruschi's career was over, and they wouldn't allow his story to go to print without an on-record source.  Imagine if either of those happened nowadays.  The rumors about Ramirez would have been fodder for weeks leading up to the trading deadline, and anyone who saw Boggs out in public with his mistress would have taken photos on their cell phone and posted them on social media five minutes later.  When your job is to report the news, you can't sit idly anymore because the number of competing outlets is exponentially larger.  Do you want to be the guy who had a major story but got beat to it by some egg with 500 followers on Twitter, because you were busy confirming your sources?
> The fairness doctrine, from 1949 to 1987, required journalists to report differing viewpoints fairly.  Reporting both sides and reporting honestly are not the same thing.
The fairness doctrine is wildly misunderstood and did far less than people think. It just has a name that makes people pine for a better time when media wasn't doing the exact same shit it does now even though that time never existed.
The fairness doctrine only applied to ota broadcasts.
>The fairness doctrine, from 1949 to 1987, required journalists to report differing viewpoints fairly.  No, it didn't. The fairness doctrine was *horrible*. What it actually did was require *equal space* to differing view points. Hopefully you can see why that's a terrible idea.
Ah the good old days of post-FDR America where the elites feared a socialist revolution and therefore at least tried to muddle together some level of decent standards for things
I 100% agree, this seems to have really started being reported more recently. It’s practice, some guys are working things out — Mac Jones going 7 for 14 in completions for a practice is meaningless.
I've seen those reports for a long time, last year was nothing new.
Not really, I'm talking about people putting stats to different sessions of practice (including 7-on-7). I'm pretty sure I used to see it on Tim Graham's stuff on ESPN, and he hasn't been there since 2011
Why is asking for additional help betrayal, I honestly don't understand?
This guy either has a vendetta against Pats fans or a boner for Florio. Not even worth engaging in actual discussion, he’ll just argue in bad faith like here
He gave them literally all of the phone data they asked for. He asked them if they needed his physical phone and they said no.   Then they got butthurt about it even though they'd specifically told him they didn't need his physical phone. They still got all the emails and all the texts. That part of the story is such a huge distraction.  Nobody seems to want to talk about how the Colts balls were also underinflated, or how no accurate measurement was taken, or how no evidence was actually found, or how the initial story the Colts told was that their DB caught the interception and said "hey this feels underinflated", but when asked the DB laughed and said that never, ever happened and he didn't notice anything weird about the ball. Or how they did a 1 year study on ball pressure, and then buried the results.   It was a sham the whole way through.
It's still newsworthy.  That's all I was saying.
Yeah, they try and say Florio’s second report is vastly different but Bill shopping Max Jones doesn’t mean it was just shopping (you know, what Florio reported) or seriously looking for a change at the position. If someone thought the second report was a big difference then it only proves that Florio was right to put out that second bit, clarifying what kind of shopping he meant
That’s fkn hilarious.
That is freaking hilarious 😂
You can just say Florio
See Pac12 is dying/not dying on /r/cfb
Then don’t engage.  Our attention is their reward. Don’t give it to them.
So basically pro wrestling journalism.
I liked the one where Tom Brady was going to be on ~~*Dancing with the stars*~~ *The Masked Singer* That had way too much effort and way to much shitposting in it and some people actually bought it
Then there's the 4th kind, Trent Crimm.
> Guys like Schefter, even if you hate him, have a pretty damn solid record when it comes to breaking stories  Yeah people incorrectly conflate “Schefter has questionable ethics” with “Schefter makes stuff up”. Shit on him all you want for being a mouthpiece/dropping news when it would generate the most clicks/selectively drops news, but he’s pretty much undefeated on the accuracy of his bombs.
This is why we have tiers for reporters in football regarding transfer rumors. And some reporters are tier 1 for certain clubs but tier 2 or 3 for others. NFL could do well to adopt this instead of just saying “fuck Florio” we could just say that Florio is tier 3, sometimes useful but not reliable.
That’s what I really enjoy about this sub, if you dig through the comments you can find out from fans if a local dude is legit or not. There’s always that one guy that a team’s fan can point to and say “If ____ is saying it then it’s probably true” helps sort through the bullshit a little better
I’m a Jets fan but I wish Mike Reiss was our reporter. Rich Cimini is terrible!
Florio stopped attempting to break stories around 2007  .
I think it’s more agents than franchises that use them as mouthpieces
Schefter has admitted that at times in the past he's fabricated stories just to " spice things up. "
They're also fed BS to be used as manipulation in the media too though, which is a huge part of the problem.
WSJ too. But its basically only the two largest newspapers in the world who were able to, which sucks
Shoutout Defector - who rose from the ashes of Deadspin and publish their year-end financials for subscribers every year.  They're doing pretty well for a non-ad based website with subscription revenue only.
It’s because it’s the perfect price point, I tried signing up for the athletic, but the value is just not there
The issue is when the internet came along, most publications thought online news was just going to be a fad, so they put their stuff up there for free  Now it's become the primary way people consume news, but the publications still need to make money to pay their employees and keep the lights on
social media is way way way worse than print media ever was.
They are 2 different versions of the same exact thing
Nah, Meirov is in the group.
There was a post like 5 days ago that mods deleted and then reposted the Kleiman version of it
The problem there is editors, or lack thereof.  The AP, which actually cares about journalistic integrity, has a set of guidelines for when anonymous sources can be used:  1. The material is information and not opinion or speculation, and is vital to the report. 2. The information is not available except under the conditions of anonymity imposed by the source. 3. The source is reliable, and in a position to have direct knowledge of the information.  Other outlets with journalistic integrity have similar rules, even if they sometimes make mistakes.  The problem here is that most of these people either aren't a member of an organization with those kind of rules in place, or they are posting stuff to their social media accounts, which absolves their employer of responsibility but benefits them anyway.  And the reason why this is a news-wide problem is because people don't have the research and critical reasoning skills necessary to determine who is a trustworthy news source and who isn't.  You will see it all the time from Patriots fans who are convinced that the Boston Globe isn't a worthwhile news source because they think John Henry forces the paper to write negative stories about the Patriots.
Seriously lol damned if you do, damned if you don’t. “She’s just flexing that she talks to players”
>to verify their sources  The commenter literally said why anonymous sources are necessary in journalism. It does contradict your desire and is relevant to your initial comment
>If legit reporters are mad about it, then they should be holding their colleagues to a higher standard instead of defending them.  Most accurate comment ITT.
>Florio just projects legitimacy more than he used to.  There is nothing in this world that Florio likes to do more than look down his nose at others while pretending he is doing something better or more legit than they are. Elon Musk or NASA or whoever the fuck should study his brain to help with supporting human life on Mars because that mother fucker hasn't had oxygen in years. He's done nothing but re-breathe his own farts for a decade now.
says the guy posting on the nfl sub in April
Felger's not EEI though.
I recall Holley starting it with radio mentions of "Ben Trollin'", but then it became "Trollin' Volin" later
He absolutely backtracked. You have to be applying 0 critical thinking to say he didn't. He reported the story as the Pats shopped Jones to 4 specific teams. Full stop. He only changed his tune after multiple people, including the team's GMs, said that it's untrue.
I would imagine he knew everyone would run with the initial report though which is why he wouldn't include not knowing how serious they are, so he's a shitter regardless
They all know that a lie gets halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to put its pants on in the morning, and abuse that fact while hiding behind minor vagaries/caveats in their original reporting
We were 1 yard (Seahawks) and 1 fumble (Bills) away from a winning record with Cam mind you
I think some of the outrage is overblown but also it’s worse to be given hope (Mac rookie year) and then feel the rug got pulled out from underneath with how terrible the offense was. You never wanna see your team make boneheaded decisions to make them worse when the promise was there the year prior. I think it’s perfectly fine to give BB all the shit for essentially wasting last season but you also have to give credit for hiring an actual OC and trying to improve the offense and acknowledge that it’s a new year and that potential we saw in 2021 can be built upon now.
No fucking shit an owner wouldn’t be happy about either of those 2 things. But there’s definitely a difference between the expectations between what the fans, media, and actual owners/players/coaches want.
And none of our WRs are better than the Bengals WR3. Using the Bengals as the benchmark is kinda dumb when they happened to suck at the right time to get a great QB in the draft and then by pure luck he got injured in the season before one of the best WRs in the NFL was draft eligible.   Patriots haven’t had the luxury of bottoming out for high draft picks like other teams, and it’s harder to rebuild when you’re an organization that isn’t going to tank your season.
Made the Super Bowl, barely lost the afc championship, too favorite to win afc again. Yes they’re perennial contenders.
31 years without a playoff win and this guys acting like they pulled a 1 year retool
Yes, this has happened on multiple occasions. At least with ESPN they acknowledge that it's all coming from inside the house. It's more disturbing when multiple media outlets are collaborators in misinformation.
Flames aren't on fire. Something is set on fire and has flames coming off of it. You can't set a flame on fire.   It's the difference between being something and being covered in something. Covering a person in water makes it wet. Covering water with water just makes bigger water.   How would you go about wetting water? Where is all this dry water? No, that's ice. I'm talking about water.
Dirt makes something dirty. Dirt is dirt, other things are dirty. Unless you're trying to claim you can have dirty dirt and clean dirt. The only way that's possible is if you're saying the dirt is contaminated by something else like worms, not the dirt itself. If you rub some dirt on dirt you just get more dirt.  There is another definition of dirty which just means not clean, but that's not the definition I mean.
You leave Bat Boy out of this
The Fairness Doctrine did not require equal space.  *First, it is important to understand what the Doctrine covered and what it did not. It was a broadcast doctrine adopted in 1949, in an era that pre-dated the political talk that we now see dominating so many cable networks. It also was different from the Equal Time Rule which is still in effect for candidate appearances on broadcast stations. The Fairness Doctrine required that stations provide balanced coverage of all controversial issues of public importance. The Fairness Doctrine never required “equal time” in the sense of strict equality for each side of an issue on a minute-for-minute basis. In talk programs and news coverage, a station just had to make sure that both points of view were presented in such a way that the listener would get exposure to them.*  *By contrast, “equal time” or “equal opportunities” stems from a different source in the Communications Act – the Section 315 provisions on the treatment by broadcast stations (and local cable systems) of candidates for public office. Essentially, equal time requires that, if a broadcast station gives one candidate free time, all other candidates can get the same amount of free time.*  https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=30caddae-9d76-4fd6-8994-041bd3d83828
Because this top rated afternoon sports show in the US has had an agenda to hate the Patriots and everything about them. So they try to drive out anything new such as Mac. One "host" would trade him for anything right now such as a 6th and just keep drafting because he's a crybaby (From his sprained ankle crying episode) to now being a snake and going around BB. Yesterday the 2nd chair host said "“A Gen Z who thinks he invented the game.” BTW this is the same host that was just suspended for saying racist remarks not even a month ago.   This is what they spew for 4 hours  &#x200B;  They are pure hate propaganda show and so many fans now follow this here.  &#x200B;  And I haven't even mentioned the Bruins and how Pasta should sit. A 50 goal scorer.....  &#x200B;  the morning show is actually good here or the 10-2 show. After that? Get ready to talk Mac jones trades, he can't throw ect ect
Because he's going around Bill and his own coaching staff. That's something you really shouldn't be doing in a team sport environment. It's an insult to the coaches on the team you are employed by. It's one thing to have a personal trainer, it's another thing to ask for outside coaching help. That's not Mac's job and so far outside of his lane.  Even Tom Brady would catch shit from his coaching staff for doing something like that.
I don't know if you're agreeing with me or arguing with me.
With you completely. If anything is clickbait it's this article lol
> Max Jones  I like this name better for some reason I cant figure out.
>If someone thought the second report was a big difference then it only proves that Florio was right to put out that second bit, clarifying what kind of shopping he meant  If he reported "BB shopping qb Mac jones, but isn't serious about trading him" it wouldn't have been news worthy....   One of two things most likely happened -  He either intentionally withheld the part about it not being serious to sensationalize the report and stir up drama.  Or he's trying to subtly walk back his initial report because multiple Patriots insiders came out and refuted it.   I'm leaning towards option number two.  Florio isn't a patriots insider, so I find it very unlikely that he somehow has the only source that has any knowledge at all about trade talks for Mac jones...
Bear with me while I defend Florio:  I might be wrong, but my impression has been that he always says, teams could do this, player might do that, but he never really claims a source told him something like that.   I don’t read much (if any) PFT articles, but watching his videos that’s the general impression I’ve gotten of his approach.

There was one where they said he took that time off before this season to be on The Masked Singer.
Some guy posted here a while ago showing how easy it was to trick these media folks, and he made up a fake story about Joe Mixon getting traded and it got posted all over sports sites and Twitter heads.
IIRC, and I might not, that that started as a high-effort Reddit shitpost and got so much attention that they mentioned it on an actual NFL broadcast.
Ex. AtoZ Sports Nashville is the gold standard for Titans news. They're a small org but their reporters, at least in Nashville, are WAY more reliable than others around town.
WR Joe Smith will go in for ACL surgery this afternoon. He will make a full recovery and be back even better than before.   Its awesome that they know how well a surgery went before they even did it.
It's both. They horse trade info from side to the other (and different factions in each side) for scoops to be named later.
It's both.
*sources close to Patrick Mahomes say....*  *LeBron's camp say he's leaning towards...*  No the fuck they didn't. Mahomes girlfriend didn't call a reporter to tell what Mahomes thinks about Eric Beinemy

When the draft was boring a few years ago cause everyone knew who the top few picks would be (shocker Lawrence went first) so Schefter dropped the Rodgers to Denver story so people would tune into draft coverage
Isn't the New Yorker the same?
Social media is just faster and more people can use it, which pumps out more variety of content that can permeate society than a few rich newspaper owners making physical media can.  But let's not downplay the fuckery that those few rich newspaper owners were able to achieve before the social media floodgates opened. Look at the Spanish-American war for instance. Or the literal nazis use of press during the Holocaust.
Maybe in the later 20th century, but yellow journalism has always been a thing, and before the internet there really wasn’t a way to find out what’s true.
No argument there.
At least we know Meirov exists as a real human. Dov on the other hand....
There was one that was mistakenly approved for an hour or so but got removed.  And that was based on a crap source which is what you are thinking was the og version.  It was a crap source too and removed.
She doesn’t even do the “*player x* just text me” thing anymore and she still gets made fun of for it. There really is no winning.
Man reading comprehension is hard for some people. I never said that anonymous sources aren’t necessary. Verifying sources doesn’t mean revealing who your source is. It means making sure your source is actually who they say they are and verifying that they would actually have access to the information they are giving. Is it too much to ask that a reporter does their due diligence?
> Elon Musk   lmao
And complete idiocy this year. Only needed one more win and we blew atleast 2 completely moronically
If we're going to play that game, they were one play away from losing to the Cardinals and Jets the first time, and it took a meteorological phenomenal event to beat the Ravens. The team was closer to 5-6 wins then they were to 9 wins, considering they spent 3 of the last 4 weeks of the season getting blown the fuck off the field.
So then why are you blaming the media when the owner feels the same as the media? Hell, the owner is fueling a lot of what the media is saying.
you don't need to "go about wetting water", it's already wet. just like you don't need to go about getting dirt dirty. those are just inherent properties of those things
Nah
I guess I don't see it as much different than having a personal trainer. But if that's the case then I get it. Even if I disagree
This is posted BY Florio. It's under his name and he specifically says a source close to the situation is giving him info. He does throw shit at the wall a lot of times, but this seems to be something either someone fed him or he appears to have just made up.  https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2023/04/04/bill-belichick-has-shopped-mac-jones-this-offseason/
That’s still just pulling stuff out of your ass for clicks.
No he will straight up make things up as a hypothetical and then treat them as fact the next day.
That would be the SEC:  * You are playing the Tigers. Which one? Missouri, LSU, or Auburn?  * You are playing a team from Columbia. Which one? Missouri or South Carolina?  * You are playing a Red/White team. Which one? Alabama, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Texas A&M, or Mississippi State?  * You are playing a UT that is Orange and White. Which one? Texas or Tennessee

That tweet was from the surgeon’s agent

Google " Adam Schefter fabrications " and you'll find plenty of sources.
Well, they're a Magazine, so they have always been a subscription service.
It's way worse for exactly that reason: it's far more efficient than its analog predecessors.
And how do you propose someone verifies their source in this manner and can communicate that to regular folks like us?
They were completely broken by the back half of the season. Post-bye, we went 3-5, and those 3 wins were a miraculous punt return td against the worst QB in the league (Jets and Zack Wilson), a team falling apart who lost their star QB to a torn ACL mere minutes into the game (Cardinals), and a third string QB. In now way was that team a playoff team.
Being "wet", "dirty", "enflamed" are specific instances of being covered in something other than what you are. Water cannot be wet because it is the thing you are trying to make wet. Wet means covered in water, not being made of water. Wet is throwing water onto something that is not water. Water is water. Wet is not water. The word you may be looking for is "liquid".
Prove it

So were newspapers. You had to pay to get the paper delivered.
It definitely has the potential to be worse, but where are the results so far? Recognizing the sample size discrepancy of ~15 years vs 150+, what worse thing has happened that can be attributed to social media alone? Teen suicide? Rohingya genocide? Jan 6th?  Terrible things happened in the 20th century too. And despite social media being more efficient, it is also less hegemonic. We'll see how long this lasts, but it's much easier to consume non corporate or government created media than ever before. Social media can give a voice to the common people that runs contrary to controlling interests.  I fucking hate social media personally, and see it changing to be more and more controlled by capital and despots, but let's not paint over what damage print media has actually done either.  Ultimately social media isn't the root cause of the things people hate social media for, it's just a tool with its own pros and cons.  Also, enjoy DJ Moore. A pros pro who deserves to see some winning football.
I don’t think they can. I think reporters have lost some of their credibility and I don’t know how they can get it back. To start though, they can get a second source to verify the information they’ve been given.   Ron Borges said Brady was going to skip training camp unless he got a contract similar to Jimmy Garoppolo. His source was some random dude who texted him pretending to be Brady’s agent. Instead of actually trying to verify that it was actually Brady’s agent that texted him, he just went ahead and reported it as fact.  We had a reporter in Boston, Kevin Cullen of the Boston Globe, that wrote stories and had radio and TV appearances about the Boston Marathon bombing where he talked about his experience being at the race and talking to the victims families. He went on the radio/tv and literally cried recounting the events. Turns out he wasn’t even there and made it all up. When he was exposed, the newspaper went after the person who exposed him. He still works there.   It’s things like this that keep happening that erodes the public’s trust in reporting. That’s why I am always skeptical now when I see a report with anonymous sources.
that's a very narrow definition of "wet" that I don't subscribe to. "covered in something other than what you are" where did that come from?
Nah
Roll tide
> A&M is more maroon and Texas is more of a burnt orange. Theory debunked.  So is Mississippi State do I really need to make another bullet point on that one? Or can the Red-ish and White-Ish teams just all be together because it is close enough. And Burnt Orange literally has Orange in its name.
This is so fucking circular lmao
Just a slight (probably poor) rewording of the dictionary definition "to be covered or saturated with water or another liquid". There's other definitions that are more specific about liquids sticking or adhering to solids, which is a more scientific way of saying what I meant.
I agree
so by that dictionary definition does water not cover itself? every molecule is surrounded by other water molecules

I saw a literal dumpster fire on the Pike west today. Rolled past a detached dumpster trailer that’d probably just been picked up from a job site and someone probably threw something too hot into the trash. Couple of fire trucks rolled up to it right as I was going past it, 5-10 foot flames shooting out of the top, smoke billowing pretty high. The driver was getting out of the truck, looked completely unhurt. I wish I could’ve gotten a picture, one of the coolest (for lack of a better word I guess) things I’ve seen in action.

I decided to treat Bronson with another walk, and this jackass sees a car coming & plops his ass down. I can't get him to move, so I have to scoop him up & run.  At first I didn't know if he suddenly got spooked, but when he fought me as we were walking past the car, I realized he's back to thinking that cars near us will pick us up.   I've had this problem before, and what tipped me off was him trying to go to the door of a slow moving car. This dog is *obsessed* with car rides & even forced his way outside when I told him he's "not going", which is a phrase he understands. I wish I could teach him that he's only ever getting rides in my car, but I'm gonna have to go back to only crossing after the road is completely clear.  My back fucking hurts, too. Damn dog

I think I’ll give it to the weekend and I’ll just have to start studying on Saturday regardless. But man I’m gonna be so sad if I study a lot and then find out I’m not taking the test.   They already gave us the study guide so I guess I can take the hint. But still, I won’t be able to focus as well if I have thoughts in the back of my head about studying possibly being a waste of time.

Shouldn't have had ice cream last night
Am I pretentious for overlooking classics in favor of watching underseen movies?
I still keep tabs with co-workers from a job I left a year ago. I saw that they have an opening and I asked about it, well I didn't leave in the best terms even though I gave a 2 week, I didn't want them to contact me after I left. They said that was a factor in not bringing me back today.   I mean I don't take offense to that, just hoping I can hear back from a job interview I had this week soon.
I am in Seattle, Washington
A friend of mine is hosting their birthday at a brewery.   I'm not a huge IPA guy. What should I get if I still want to drink?  https://www.portcitybrewing.com/copy-of-beer
Apple seriously has almost all of the best shows I’ve seen recently. I’m sure there’s a couple duds in there and I wasn’t a huge fan of the latest season of Mythic Quest(E1 was really great though) but there’s just so much good stuff.
crazy frustrated with people who will only tell you what you want to hear, that everythings fine, when their actions suggest completely differently  but every time you try to bring it up, understand if/what the issue is there's no problem, everything is great, lets keep on doing what we're doing  sick of tying to read between the lines or guess at what to do when people aren't willing to communicate   grumpy morning
Tricia Cotham switching parties after being elected in a 60% democrat district, securing a veto-proof majority for republicans and with no option for recall, just shows how vulnerable much of our system is to people without a capacity for shame or sense of morality. Pure deceit, applied directly and without concern, just doesn’t have a counter play in our system.
So I guess we're done with the 32 teams threads? Despite like 8 teams not getting a post 😞
For anyone that’s watching the new season of Ted Lasso and also needs a book recommendation, Beard and Ted are shown frequently reading Reversing The Pyramid by Jonathan Wilson. Highly recommend it if you have any interest in soccer, really shows the advancement and globalization of the game while answering a lot of questions you didn’t even know you had
Is there any worse feeling than being extremely drunk and trying to fall asleep but the room just keeps spinning
Starting my first Starfinder game tonight. Playing a sentient killbot who got his mind wiped and is now a pizza chef. If anyone has any tips for new players, send them my way.
*Asked for an IEP evaluation for my daughter from the school back in October*  School: Well let's not be too hasty. Let's start with an unofficial behavior management plan that does nothing first, and then we'll never follow up with you again  *Got a diagnosis of ASD and ADHD through a psychologist by filling out a bunch of forms, then pushed for an IEP again*  School: oh sorry you would actually need evaluation-based testing for her to qualify for services  *Got a diagnosis of ASD and ADHD through a neuropsychologist conducting 4 hours of evaluation-based testing over 2 separate days.*  School: oh sorry again, this is just a neuropsychologist with a PhD at a neuropsychology clinic, we would still need an MD to sign on off on this. But not her pediatrician.  lol okay guys. As long as we are making it as hard as possible to get this IEP rolling, I'm satisfied.
I wonder if the people who have been harping for decades on George Soros buying liberals are going to say anything about this Clarence Thomas/Harlan Crow situation... 🤔  Not a single post on r/conservative about the matter just yet.

I like how corporate decided to give out free food and offer other incentives for going into the office, but they can’t get it to 5% capacity so they’re just forcing everyone to come back lol  God forbid you give your employees the benefit of work from home. Going to the office adds an extra hour and a half to my day with getting ready and commute, it sucks ass
I enjoyed the Mario movie but there this one kid in the theater that was so loud
RFK Jr is running for president, and the only thing notable about that is he could end up inheriting a lot of Trump's cultists if Trump is actually convicted of a felony.  They're currently hyping themselves up over him, and while it seems unlikely a Republican could lose support to a Democrat, policy isn't what drives these people. They have even turned on Trump several times, for stuff like briefly promoting the covid vaccine. What guides them is thinking they're smarter than everyone else, because they believe in conspiracy theories and others don't.  Especially since Ron Watkins quit being Qanon in 2020 once Trump lost, they're desperately looking for a new voice.   I don't think RFK jr will have a chance in hell, but I *am* predicting his grift game increases & he takes his biggest shit yet on the name "Robert F Kennedy"
I wonder what the Packers endgame is. They have no leverage with Rodgers. It's either trade him or make him the most expensive inactive player in the league.
I genuinely would love to hear what dudes like Phil Knight or the CEO of Budweiser think when all these hillbillies start burning/trashing their stuff because of something like a rainbow can.  Both of these corporations donate billions to Republican candidates every single year.  They're literally just trying to maximize their profits with corporate pandering and it drives these morons insane.  Literally the only reason Kaep got a Nike sponsorship was $$.  Dude ended up being a sell-out.  They still make Kyrie's shoes as well as "Fuck Hong-Kong" Lebron.  But you know, they're totally woke as fuck.
I’ve been in such a game rut lately. Anyone got any, maybe slightly more obscure, gaming suggestions? I play pretty much everything. I’m just biding my time until Diablo comes out.

I don't know how to tell the higher ups that it's a fucking batshit stupid idea to make hourly employees responsible for receiving the security camera alerts from the new arlo cameras they want to install instead of using a security camera service.  Like, the amount of overtime they're about to be forced into paying out every time a camera alert gets looked at is going to be completely fucked.
There's one manager at my store who always says yes when I call and ask to come in (I need the hours).  I hope to God they don't send him somewhere else.
As much as I want the Bears to draft an OT, I want the Panthers to draft AR far more; not saying dude will be a bust, but if he starts his rookie season, it'll be rough.
It is my strong belief that Memphis should be in Arkansas. Why does Tennessee get both Nashville and Memphis?
I think about getting a new computer monitor from time to time but I have this this AOC 20" monitor since 2008 around the time when windows Vista came out. It has no dead pixels, and even after heavy use it is still as bright as the day I bought it.

I’m not sure if I heard this correctly, but I overheard someone in the locker room saying that if we changed the definition of obesity to 35 BMI instead of 30, then America would be healthier because not as many people would be obese. Which I guess technically yeah, not as many people would be classified as obese, but this is basically in the same vein as “if we stop testing for COVID, there won’t be as many cases”  I feel dumber just for existing
My family members listen to conservative talk radio and they're literally talking about how American is going to shit because the women in Victoria's secret ads aren't hot enough for them anymore   Also these fucking people are obsessed with trans people  Imagine being such a fucking loser that your entire life revolves around hating people you've literally never met
Tennessee legislators are getting removed for protesting in favor of gun control. Fucking bullshit.
Reading about SCOTUS rejecting a petition from West Virginia asking to enforce a previously blocked transgender sports ban  "Two Justices dissented from denying the appeal"  Me: "Hmm, I wonder which two"  Article: "Clarence Thomas and Sam Alito"  Absolute shocker that it's the obvious two lmao
Fuck, my son's day care is closing soon. We are so bummed as he got used to the ladies there, the other kids, and his routine/schedule over there. Now we gotta start the whole goddamn process of finding a place again; and this time under a huge time crunch
My 15-month-old can't really catch a football yet, but he'll sort of fetch it for me if I throw it, so that's something.  Managed to occupy him with that for a solid 10 minutes before he decided he rather climb into a laundry hamper.
Rant  Fuck Kansas and fuck transphobes. Yes, even you and your "fairness women's sports" virtue signaling.  Who can tell who the transphobes are when a "trans women in sports" bill comes up. They'll always side with the "purity of the sport" they never cared about instead of the plethora of medical needs and community support that transgender people need to mitigate the harmful effects of gender dysphoria (like suicide, which is kinda harmful), including hormones and integration into society as their identified gender.  Look, you're not clever. We know you're using sports as an in to legislate all care from every trans youth in the state and to grope underage genitals. And you're a shitty enough person to think that a basketball game of one school is more important than the suicide rate of all the trans kids in the state.
Get busy livin', or get busy dying.

my gym is busier at 5:30 in the morning than it is at 8:30.  I can't do anything with this information but knowing it makes me sad.
MMMMM, love work tech issues when I have an enormous day full of work.  also shoutout to my entire office where only 2 employees have turned in their required paperwork to me, since I am the new secretary since we refuse to hire a new one after the old one quit, not like it was due yesterday.

Aldi takes a massive dump on everyone's prices. I had to pick up a few things from a not-Aldi store over lunch for my al pastor jackfruit tacos tonight, and good lord it was probably twice what I'd pay at Aldi.
I feel like people are sleeping on the fact that Fields just had the best QB rushing season of all time.  You'd think we'd hear about that more, but nah, not much noise there.  I'm rooting for the lad.
Got a feeling Clarence Thomas will hope to “retire” at the next available opportunity. His wife’s thing he could pass off as “oh I don’t have control over my wife’s actions”. This one is squarely on him. Roberts will pressure him to retire - the only thing he cares about is the court’s image and this is one humongous thing he can’t make disappear.  Maybe that optimistic given it’s Clarence Thomas but we need some optimism nowadays.  First prosecuting a former President, hopefully next a sitting Supreme Court judge (both rightfully so). What a country.
Anyone have a good RPG recommendation? I have a PS4 and a reasonably capable PC. I haven't played a final fantasy game since 10, but I liked 4-8. Pixel or 3D, old or new, is all fine. In the last couple years I’ve played a lot of Grim Dawn and Last Epoch, but it doesn’t need to be an action RPG. Has to be solo play because I'm bad at games, and I don’t like anime titties.
Thinking about the guy using his Costco card to pick up a chick at a college basketball game. Just a hilarious visual

I broke my bench PR (now 215) with an injured shoulder (which I then injured a bit more). So now my three-lift total is 355 DL  +295 Squat + 215 Bench for 865/1000. Now to heal my shoulder and train hard. Hoping to hit this goal before August, but with an injury slowing me down, we'll see. I might just have to focus my gains in my legs.

Why was Dr Phil's doppelganger shooting up cases of bud light he gets for free?  Was it to cripple their profits the same way conservatives did nike? Oh, nike actually made more than ever after the maga faithful started their boycott?  Then how about the nfl? Remember when the right wingers stopped watching the nfl in protest to black dudes kneeling during the anthem, after a white navy seal told them and the world it wasn't disrespectful? They really showed the nfl. Oh, nfl profits have only gone up since?   Bet you kid rock is a shareholder in the company that owns bud light and banks off this. Wonder how many ppp loans this douche applied for and got. Fuck him, his music has sucked since the late 90s.
I submitted my phone to the repair shop. Feels weird to drive around listening to FM radio like it's 2003 again.
As a Rays fan, I am having an absolutely great time watching baseball right now, but one thing is clear: the juiced balls are definitely back in some capacity. Because we are bot a power hitting team, and yet the home runs have been large and plentiful so far.

Anyone who supports Israel these days are lunatics. The only way you can defend what they do is if you don't value the humanity of Palestinians, straight up.
Man, some people really think we're stupid. Cold call us trying to get info so they can get the parts they need somewhere else like we don't know what they're doing. Lmao.

Who wants to walk with me to go get an April parking pass for the parking garage. I’m gonna leave at either 11:30 or 12. I could drive, but it’s only about a 15 min walk and I’ll have an hour to kill. I know it’s the 6th but I had to make sure my rent was paid before spending the clams on this bad boy.
Sadly someone already posted this yesterday but I'll still ask:  Hi Houston Texans fans! Did you know that UConn Mens Basketball has just as many postseason wins in NRG Stadium as the Texans?
My favorite...  ...NBA team: Trail Blazers  ...MLS team: Timbers  ...NWSL team: Reign & Pride  ...MLB team: Astros  ...NHL team: Avalanche  ...NFL team: Bengals/Ravens/Bills/Seahawks/Jaguars/Broncos/Eagles/Vikings all roughly equally

I’m going to laugh so hard when AEW Dynamite’s rating comes out today and it’s over a million meanwhile wwe had a very disappointing mania weekend, Vince is back in charge & ruining the product already. Oh, Jay White said F the E and signed with the good guys too. And can’t forget, LMAO Cody. Feels good to be an AEW fan right now. Also, the pats will make the playoffs & the new juice place down the street is the shit. Blueberry Pom for the win. What a great week.
Rumors have been swirling the Giants may trade for Stefon Diggs. By rumors I mean Giants podcasters diving deep in to the off season now that free agency has died down.  I don’t see it happening, but in the chance he does want to be traded, why?   Does he believe the Bills have no chance of beating the Chiefs or Bengals if he wants to make it to a Super Bowl?  Personally don’t want him, assuming he’d cost us our first round pick I would rather see the Giants draft receiver instead of him.
Home run breaks the stalemate at Changwon. 1-0, NC!

2.5 hours left but I'm so sleepy
Imagine an alternate reality where either the Texans or the Rams took Khalil Mack at 1 or 2 in 2014 to be paired with a dominant DE or a legendary DT to be taken with the Rams' second 1st rounder.   What a whiff.  And the Raiders suck.  Rightfully so.
Drop a good lemonade recipe
RE4 Remake  Horizon Burning Shores DLC  Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom  Jedi Survivor  Bruh, someone's wallet is gonna get absolutely fucked within the span of a month lol
Only about 6 games into the Korean baseball season but the fact that NC won 2-0 today over Kiwoom (the semifinalist from last year, and a solid team with Lee Jung-Ho) is pretty big. NC's win propels them to 3-3 and a .500 record.
So they just announced a bunch of Star Wars stuff while I was asleep cool
We're proud of you too.
That’s an insane achievement. Hope you’re feeling much healthier!
I'm proud of you too! Went through that journey a few years ago and it was the best thing I ever did for myself! Hope you get exactly what you want out of it!
Nice. The improvement in sleep alone is worth all the work.
congrats
rock on
Let's go!! That's how it starts!
This has turned into gas station stories so here's mine.  When I was in high school my buddy's and I were just driving around. We passed a gas station in front of the local music venue where 3 Doors Down was playing. There was a couple having sex in the bushes by the corner of the gas station.   And before you ask, we were 17 so yes we turned around and looked again.
Most interesting thing I've ever seen at a gas station was when a van pulled away with the hose still in the tank.  There was a metallic shearing sound followed by a hollow bang as the hose was ripped out of the pump, then a series of clicks as everything automatically shut down and all the pumps started blinking all zeros in their displays. It was actually kind of interesting to see.
How old was this student?
I can understand not seeing a floppy disk in action or not understanding how to use a rotary telephone, but that's a little odd, even for a kid.   I mean, if there was no color TV in the 80's, all of the 80's cartoons and video games would have been made in black and white, yes?
I almost gotta think that somewhere in his life he mixed up color TV with HD TV (which also existed before 2008, but wasn't super common).
If you just add the words ‘in Wisconsin’ somewhere in you sentence, it makes much more sense.
where ya goin
Thinking about Tennessee right now makes me feel angry and sad.  That's all I've got in me for trash talk right now, I got some bad news late yesterday and I'm still not over it.
“Honesty, I’m comfortable in my current role and I’m focusing on some external self-development to better round myself out as an employee. This position allows me to strike a healthy work-life balance and I don’t find myself overburdened with tasks that prevent me from doing my actual responsibilities.”
I loathe the where do you see yourself in five years question. Like shit man hopefully happy
I made stuffed shells last night.  Twas good.
Good luck. Enjoy the air escaping your system after you wake up, lol
I had one this winter.  After the 12th shit it was just pooping water.
Had a breakfast sandwich from Sheetz, it was great. God speed soldier
Second half of a leftover Bobbie sandwich (turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce and mayo) from a new Capriotti's Sandwich Shop that just opened up near us. It's been snowing too, so it feels appropriate for the weather.

Nothing more ear piercing than a baby learning different kinds of screams. The excited ones seem to be the most intense.
My niece doesn't quite fully understand and thinks that the only way to scream is to do it while running.  Makes for a fun time.
I just rewatched the first few episodes earlier this week. Sobel is such a complicated character, militarily speaking he was an amazing company commander, and he's why E Company fought as well as they did.   But he fails as a leader of men, and his own skills were not to the standard he was setting.
I saw band of brothers before friends so I was shocked to learn the boot camp guy from band of brothers was also on a sitcom lol

What do you call a Filipino contortionist?  Manila folder.
the highs are high and the lows are low. when you've been in love with someone and wanted to be with them all the time, it's hard to be around them when it's not that way anymore. there's always an imbalance, it makes it hard to move on, and usually there's at least some bad feelings. clean breaks are easier for everyone.
Relationships take effort to maintain. Too many people seem to have a "You vs me" mentality when faced with difficulties instead of an "Us vs the problem" one.

Which sucks. He actually had some solid tracks. I presume he focuses more on his show now and I assume there are some original tracks in there. From what I recall he was an SNL writer before coming out with that rap album so it's a natural progression to get back into the television business.
It's a pretty good show though.
This bitch don't know bout Pangea.
Also, why can’t he talk yet. It shouldn’t take 50 years to learn words. His species clearly speaks English.
For me almost entirely spotify. Or YouTube randomly recommends something I like.
What kind of music do you like? If you like metal/rock I'll link you some stuff.
The Spotify recommendations worked pretty well for me. My best finds were when I let a playlist finish out and then “train” the algo with your skips and saves. The playlist sets some guardrails vs just a song or two.
Hand to heart, Youtube just kind of recommends shit that's usually AMVs and I let it roll lmao

You have some die hards (constitutional law scholars/students) clinging to the glory days (Warren Court) and hoping they can get back there, but most everyone else knows with the current leadership it’s going to produce a garbage (or at best mediocre) product year-in year-out.
This was actually the norm for the Supreme Court until the Warren Court.  Warren and Burger helped restore faith in SCOTUS as a governmental body.  Now their reputation is back down in the sludge.
Feeling cute. Might vote to expel a couple of my Democratic colleagues from the state house for exercising their right to protest and holding views different than my own later. IDK.
Right? They’ve successfully turned race relations into a partisanship as well and get all shocked pikachu face when they are called out on their racism.  Oh and cancel culture? They hate cancel culture and the offended snowflakes that come with it. But what are they doing with the beer? Getting offended at the existence of trans people and also calling for their cancellation. It’s wild that they can’t see the hypocrisy. It’s almost as if their definition of snowflake is just someone intolerant of bigotry. That’s also their definition of woke. They just want to continue to be hateful with no consequences. That’s all it is.
Critical thinking isn't their strong suit. Or thinking at all for that matter.
I saw a meme earlier which shows LGBT issues are discussed by conservatives at a significantly higher rate than LGBT people
You could've gone with the seahawks lol that sucks
I have no clue what that means, so I'm choosing to believe it's aim so bad, you'd be better off playing Civ.
City pop is such a good genre.

the news sucks minimize that as much as you can  stay up to date with things that are actionable  but there's way too much going on and only so much time in a day
I'm dreading the day the court inevitably overturns affirmative action. So many hard working people are going to be dismissed from education and jobs because of it.  My uncle is one of those people who would hire a African American, Hispanic, Muslim, or woman candidate simply because he's a racist and sexist pig who believes that they're genetically less intelligent than White and Asian men and that women don't belong in the workplace. He has the power to hire, fire, and promote and the only reason why there are non-indian and non-white men in his organization is through DEI initiatives.   And there are millions of people who go to work everyday just like him.
The electoral victories in Wisconsin and Chicago are reason to remember that not everyone agrees with the fascists.  At least for a little while.
Same.  My wife and I want to move because everything is going to shit.  Neither of us want to go north, which leaves us very few options.
I would say it's unbelievable, but we all know that's not true anymore.
And if you're a Republican lawmaker today in a red state trying to make a name for yourself amongst a base hungry for any reason to attack the left as bitter enemies, why wouldn't you propose the same action on members of the minority party under the flimsiest of excuses?
Forgive me if I’m misunderstanding but they voted to expel him based on his role in a gun control protest? They thought he was trying to incite a riot, right? Regardless, absolute horseshit.
They could have just achieved the same the same message by just removing them from all committees.

In some ways yes, because a lot of the classics are classics for a reason. But at the end of the day it's for your enjoyment so it doesn't fucking matter lmao
i wouldn't say pretentious at all but it is good to keep a balance imo. classics are classics for a reason, it's good to cover those bases if you want a more well rounded view on movies.

Optimal Wit looks like a leveled up Blue Moon. Great for sipping and chilling. Personally I’d go with the Pilsners, tho, and down about nine of ‘em. But I’m also an alcoholic.
Lpt: Just look at the abv and drink based on how drunk you want to get. All beer is basically the same, there I said it.
that's been on my list to read since like ~~2036~~ 20*13*--i think someone mentioned it in a grantland piece on the runup to the 2014 world cup--and i *finally* started it last fall just before the WC kicked off.  i'm on page 36 and have been for abour four months now :(  edit: also it's called *inverting* the pyramid, not reversing

Biting down on the inside of your mouth/tongue while chewing would be the only thing that comes close for me.
It’s awful. I’m so glad I don’t really like drinking much, so many side effects that just make you feel like garbage.
jesus, do not envy this. I remember my mom preparing lawsuits because my public schools wouldn't make reasonable accommodations and I didn't qualify for in-school counselling as my family was above the required income level for aid. I too had diagnoses (for seizure issues not ASD) from country-leading experts and multiple children's hospitals and admins/teacher were *still* reluctant to help me.  For some reason a whole lot of people who don't care for kids...work in schools with young kids.
Once she gets the IEP she gets legal protection. No IEP, no legal protection, no duty to her.  Sorry the school sucks here.
Kinda like how everday fetterman was in the hospital there were no less than three posts on conservative about how he is unfit for office. Where as slip and fall victim mitch mcconnell is still in the hospital with a broken hip and they are having a super rough time trying to repair his 85 year old turtle shell. But not one headline about him..
I mean, everyone knows Clarence Thomas is a partisan hack in the most extreme of ways. It's not really news.
Sounds like it might be an ironic post, but I don't know this person.
Anybody that uses the word woke unironicly instantly brands themselves as a complete idiot. They don't have two brain cells to rub together.
I just don't understand what woke means to these people? like, are equal rights woke?   As Jay Oakerson basically says: "I consider myself woke, don't you? Don't you consider yourself whatever you think the good version of woke means? Like, I don't want to hurt anybody."
They don’t know and that’s what’s hilarious to me lmao
The optimist in me is going to focus on the fact that Tennessee’s legislature is openly announcing to the entire world that “yes, we are racists and yes, we are fascists and yes, we are scared” and is taking solice in the fact that they are ensuring that Justin Jones will come back far more powerful than he ever was before.
They aren't gonna pay that building lease for nothing!
Should have hit them with a Stone Cold Stunner.
This is what killed my drive to go to the movies. More than Covid. Loud-ass annoying kids and teenagers.  I was so happy a couple of weeks ago when I went to see Quantamania. A group of 14-16 year olds behind me in line were already being loud and causing a general ruckus. When they reached the front of the line, the cashier told them to leave and come back another night.
On the one hand, you can usually get most people to STFU with a terse request.  On the other hand, I feel like loud young people kind of comes with the territory if you're seeing the Mario movie, [so...](http://thenewswheel.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rashida-jones-the-office-shrug-gif.gif)

Here's an idea.  How about we get some candidates that aren't 100 years old?
TIL RFK Jr is married to Cheryl from Curb Your Enthusiasm
The biggest tragedy the Kennedy family ever had to deal with was RFK Jr's existence.
I don’t get it. They aren’t going to get any draft picks this year pretty soon.
> Both of these corporations donate billions to Republican candidates every single year.  No one is donating *billions* to any candidates.
The whole concept of burning or destroying merchandise you have already purchased to protest a company is so hilarious to me. Newsflash guys, they already got their money, they don't care anymore. If you care SO much about asinine things, just trash it quietly or hold onto it and never use it and just be done.
Republicans just don't seem to believe in capitalism or the free market anymore when it upsets their delicate culture warrior sensibilities.  They clutch their pearls with one hand, grab their AR-15s with the other and scream "Cancel Culture!" as they fire away...

I try not to replace perfectly functional hardware and stretch what I have as long as I can, but getting a 120hz+ monitor is absolutely worth it
Shoot, I have a 144hz Asus monitor from 2015 that's perfectly good that I still think about replacing sometimes. But that's just me feeling tempted by tech envy.
Actually sounds like a step up from Tucker whining about how the female M&M's aren't sexy enough for him.   The trans hatred obsession was always in the pipeline, I knew it was the next boogeyman for them once "plain old gays and lesbians" were "too mainstream" and no longer "scary" enough to whip their base into a frenzy.   But I'll admit, I never foresaw them bringing back and coupling it (and being sucessful at it) with the ridiculous and deranged Satanic Panic pedophile witch hunts (everywhere but the churches of course!) from the late 1970s to early 80s.   These people are just the spawn of and in some cases the same mentally disturbed people who ruined thousands of lives over bullshit like "Michelle Remembers" and the McMartin Preschool.
Those “protestors” stormed the Capitol building just like January 6th people. The legislators who got booted enabled them and put the lives of other legislators in danger.
Clarence was too busy banging hookers on some Republican billionaire prick's yacht to invest much time in this one.   Maybe next time.
My kid's previous provider (who we'd been using for two years) abruptly closed up shop recently.  He's finishing his third week at a new place, and absolutely loving it - great kids, great provider, and even his potty training is improving quickly.  It's a pain for sure, but it could end up being great for everyone.
Daughter is 8. We pull out the couch and go “over the top” while mimicking/watching YouTube videos of Walter Payton. Good times are coming my friend. It’s going to get fun.

Hope we get some LIV/PGA Tour drama.
Might be some solid background noice while I do schoolwork.    The masters always gives me this weird nostalgia. For a few years growing up this was the time of year we'd travel down to Florida to vacation when I was growing up and it was the first time I had ever left the state as a kid. I remember the masters being on and the NBA playoffs.

I love them. Only thing I don't like is they don't have a deli like most other supermarkets, so only prepackaged cold cuts, but they have everything else in good quality for less than other chains.
thanks for the heads up there's one here  i alreays hear about the low prices on tv  but i've never seen them in person.
I'd suggest that maybe the current Lamar Jackson saga is coloring our perception of that? Let's compare their sophomore rushing stats.  In 2019, Lamar rushed 169 times for 1206 yards, 6.9 ypc, and 7 TDs. going 13-2 as a starter (wins shouldn't be QB stats but they are, face it)  In 2022, same number of stars, Justin Fields rushed 160 times for 1143 yards, 7.1 ypc, and 8 TDs, going 3-12 as a starter.  You can argue which one is better, but the fact that Lamar can't get the contract he wants and is in limbo might mean that a comprable QB rushing season might not mean as much about their long term value?
While having a QB that can run is always a bonus, they don't exactly draft them to do that and only that. When he starts progressing as a passer, then we'll talk about how well he's doing.
I think we hear about it plenty given that Fields really has no success and no passing stats but still gets touted as a good QB. Like, the fact that the Bears traded back from No. 1 means they still have faith in Fields, and I think the rushing stats are a huge piece of that.  But how much hype is a QB on a 3-win team going to get? If the Bears start performing, people will make more noise.
It's probably related to the losing. He's electric to watch as a runner though.
I swear people in the media want him to fail for some insane reason. It’s gotta be like the LOLJets narrative. They probably think the Jets and Bears deserve QB futility forever so they’ll shit on any of their QB’s for clicks.
I'd bet almost any amount of money that he's not gonna retire under a Democratic President/Senate.
I commend your optimism but history has shown us that Democrats will resign, they will force their own to resign, they will support the prosecution of their own when it’s warranted. Republicans simply will not.
Fractured, but Whole was surprisingly addictive
Definitely not a niche game, but I'm replaying Fallout New Vegas right now and am being reminded of how  much of a masterpiece that game is.
Going with JRPGs.  * Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD * Final Fantasy XII The Zodiac Age * Dragon Quest VIII * Dragon Quest XI * Persona 4 Golden * Persona 5 Royal * Omori * Undertale * CrossCode  X and X-2 are both great. HD has the international edition upgrades. The Zodiac Age is almost a different game from base 12 with all the changes.   Dragon Quest games are good fun. I'd recommend 8 first because 11 has better gameplay.   The Persona games are anime, but not overly fan service heavy outside of a couple sections where it's for a story purpose. I'd still recommend them because the story is so good.  Omori is an indie RPG gem. It's like Earthbound.  Undertale is Undertale.  CrossCode is another fun indie RPG.
chained echoes is a fun little indy game that's super nostalgic for games like chrono-trigger and ffvi.  If you have a ps4 then the ff7 remake part 1 was really fun and definitely has some more forgiving modes for folks like us who are bad at games.  If you're willing to try out an mmo, ffxiv is fun and has a fabled and shockingly non-toxic community.  There's also a ton of stuff you can do in the world that doesn't involve queuing for dungeons and even when you do people are generally super happy to see sprouts running around.  I've been having fun with yakuza like a dragon, its the only game in that franchise ive played and its very much a jrpg that doesnt suffer from not having played the franchise.  No anime tittys that ive seen so far.  octopath traveler is fun, the sequel is out but i haven't touched it yet.  relatively short which i prefer, i don't have the capacity to dump 100+ hours into a game in the first play through.
I'd recommend Disco Elysium. It's very light on action but it's writing and the mystery at its center are both fantastic.
If your computer can run it, *Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord* is a game you can easily drop a few hundred hours in.
Pillars of Eternity. The world they built is amazing(will be the setting for Avowed), the storytelling is good and the characters are well written. Also you can probably get it and all the dlc for cheap.
I’ve been playing the hell out of Tactics Ogre Reborn since Christmas. Starts off a little slow but some real interesting storylines and the grinding is optional toward the end of the game, keeps it from slogging down too much.
I like the RPGs the military uses.

I was a much more conventional (plain squat, bench, deadlift) lifter but I really need to get back into it. I’m doughy as a mfer. Miss that hard body life.
I could be as wrong as wrong can get here, but Kyler's issues strike me as a maturity problem more than anything else, including motivation.  Geno was far worse in his early days, but he was behaving like an elder statesman field general last year.  Maturity can be developed, it's just a question of how long.  If Gannon is going to reach Kyler, this is where it needs to happen imo
He's definitely got the skills. It's a shame he had to be coached by that ass clown Kingsbury to start his career.

The point is, if someone thinks that their choice of drink has any effect, or anything to do with their sexuality, their grasp of sexual identity is tenuous at best.

They didn't use nazi images. Sonebody made a b-roll and accidentally used modern stock footage of auschwitz interspliced with other stock footage of prisons without realizing what it was. It wasn't intentional.   You got dragged there and you're trying to save face by dragging them elsewhere? You need a life dude
Because the image in question was removed straight after it's first airing and was clearly a mistake than something deliberately malicious.   What's more pathetic is you coming over here and bitching about it, despite the fact the issue you're saying is happening fails to include the fact you're arguing in bad faith and pushing a claim over something that was never true in the first place and fails to take into account the man literally shares his real name with somebody more of a Nazi 'War Hero' than the initial name ever was.
A lot of WWE marks aren't that different from MAGAs in their cultlike fervor.   Besides that geriatric scumbag roidmonkey who is apparently back in the saddle again, it's fitting that Cheeto Mussolini is in their Hall of Fame.   And Vince probably has the same book of Hitler speeches (My New Order) next to his bed that Cheeto did.
AEW will be in a great spot if they can pull a few big names from the coming exodus to fill out the top of their card. I’m hoping that when HHH bails, Tony throws a pile of money at him to come lead creative.

Astrology is way down on my list of conversions that will make me hate someone. Way down.
Hate is a strong word, but I really really really don’t like…  Hating people over stupid shit.
Yes, astrology is dumb but I don't hate the people because it's a very common weakness in human beings to believe in things with zero proof. Something like 85% of the world population belongs to some religion. And you can't tell me religion is any more believable than astrology. I just shrug and accept that most people need stuff like that but other than that, they're still decent people.
You ain't ready. You gotta peel the skin off the lemons, sprinkle sugar all over them, then let them sit for a few hours. Then you boil them, strain them off and keep the liquid, and add that to your lemon juice.  Peel is where the good flavor is.
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/281089/state-fair-lemonade/ This is what I use. A little labor intensive, but easily modifiable for extra sweet/less sweet.
One ounce of lemon juice, 5 tablespoons of sugar, 8 ounces of water, 3 teaspoons of salt, 2/3 cup of sour cream, 1 teaspoon of brown sugar, 2, teaspoons of light brown sugar, 3 teaspoons of stevia, 2 cups of distilled white vinegar, And 1 can of Fresca.  Put this all in a pitcher and use an immersion blender for a smooth and creamy consistency.

Thinking about Tennessee makes me angry too. Titans aside, Tennessee is such a shit show. I hate everything our state government is doing. It’s embarrassing.

My wife and I used to talk about moving to a more affordable southern or midwestern city. But the more some of these states keep passing batshit legislation, the more I think it's safer just to stay in Colorado.
I hear you we are in NJ and honestly don't even know where we would think to move after retirement. Might just stay put
>They thought he was trying to incite a riot, right?   No. They didn't think this. It might be their stated reason but none of them actually think this is what happened.
Our current Republican Party is long past just wanting to dip their toes into fascism. They're all in at this point and have been for some time now.

yeah the school is totally out of their depth and struggling to handle her on a daily basis. it's been very stressful for them, for us, and worst of all for my daughter. I'll be glad to have this IEP in place ASAP and should have it shortly (along with ABA therapy, ADHD meds, counseling, and other things that should help the situation) but I wanted to vent a little about what a struggle it's been. still jumping through hoops even though, really, the school had legal obligation to provide the IEP eval I think 60 days after my initial October request and we're way past that. it's always something here.
It's news that he has likely broken the law several times over the past couple of decades in service of his partisan hackiness though.
My MAGA family doesn’t know this. I’m assuming they are a microcosm of their tribe. Most of them aren’t fed any information that is going to make them think ill about the Right. It’s how they got this way in the first place.

"Anything I don't like is Woke"
This is why I tend to go mid day for most my movies now.   I don't mind the noises of snacks and all that. But feel like every movie I've gone to since covid has had loud jerks everywhere. Also so many more babies. I had one start crying in the middle of Fast 9. That was my first movie after Covid and I was like "yup good to be back"
Oh god yeah. If we could make it so people with personality disorders can't get elected, too, things would be nicer.
Not what you're looking for, but Ron Desantis is 44
Josh Shapiro is 49 and Gretchen Whitmer is 51, and are not facists
It’s actually a wildly small amount of money to get a candidate onboard with what you want, like maybe a couple 100,000s and that’s on the high side
Sorry for the hyperbole but Knight spent over 4 million in Oregon alone for an "independent" that sides with GOP 90% of the time and the Republican gubernatorial candidate.  Anheuser-Busch's PACS donated 3 million last year of which only $70k went to non-republicans.  And that's just what we can get from public records.  That's millions of dollars each year going almost exclusively to the GOP.
Just restarted since I haven't been back in a few updates. Still having fun with that game off and on.
Arkansas is low key one of the prettiest scenery states in the US though
So elected officials should be removed from office by their colleagues, thus depriving their constituents of representation, simply for holding views you disagree with?  Maybe we should just go ahead and get rid of that whole voting thing too then??
Gun registry and red flag laws aren’t “horrendously unconstitutional”
The issue is whether those laws are unconstitutional is determined by the Supreme Court. The Tennessee *State* legislature isn't who determines what is constitutional.    Oh, also, the standing of things in the constitution can change...via...wait for it...legislators deciding in large enough amounts to do so. That's what amendments are.
[From a Tennessee newspaper:](https://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/politics/2023/04/06/rep-gloria-johnson-survives-expulsion-vote-tennessee-house-for-peaceful-gun-control-demonstration/70087846007/)  > The March 30 demonstration was peaceful – both inside and outside the House chamber where thousands gathered to demand a ban on the types of assault weapons used in the school shooting. There was no property damage, no injuries or arrests made, according to the Tennessee Highway Patrol, which provides security at the the Capitol in Nashville.  Stop lying
I must’ve missed the part where protesters broke into the building and were violently assaulting people.
Nope. Try again.
I'd love to see you show me where the protestors in Tenn were beating cops with flagpoles.
No, he voted to hear it. It's a topic even this court has repeatedly dodged, except for its two most blatant Republican partisans.
My personal favorite is that on one hand they're telling you about the sanctity of women's sports. And then on the other you're "woke" if you care about women's sports like the WNBA (see Clay Travis calling ESPN woke for talking about the New York Liberty).    Hey I guess it's an improvement from them outright mocking women's sports...
There was a comment in that thread of someone talking about all the people who were born men, who are competing against women in *bodybuilding*.
I mean. There are a decent number of cis women athletes that don't want to compete against trans women.
The same people who want to ban trans women from just being part of the team in the name of fairness are the same people who made every justification for the NCAA for not equipping the women's march madness tournament with adequate gym equipment a year ago and argue against fair pay for the USWNT.  They only love women as long as it lets them discriminate against someone they perceive to be in a lower caste.

You're right but Higgins as a serial killer felt so right, especially that touching dialogue he had while he was cutting Jaime's face off.
They even occasionally get USDA prime meat in. I know a few weeks ago they had USDA prime New York Strips.
They also have unique items that will come and go every week, so it's fun to stop by, but the stuff that's there's every day is usually much cheaper than what you find at big boxes.
Yes, unfortunately I agree. My guess is that he’ll hope to drag it out until the next Republican President/Senate combo and then boom that’s his first available out and he’ll take it.
it was a good game.
I put a ton of time doing nothing but RPing a merchant, going from town to town, buying low, selling high.   It would have been incredibly boring to watch, but I was entranced by it all. only started fighting when I got rich and could simply buy all the best gear.
He doesn't realize he's airing out his gfs laundry also. Really tone deaf stuff
Yeah he basically admitted to cheating on his gf with his hex wife & instead of having a conversation with her in private he decided to tell everyone in a Twitter thread. His gf didn't know & I think found out from the tweets
No time like the present to dig back in!  If you haven't tried weightlifting before it's a great sport to jump into for some novelty and to improve your mobility
Agree. I think with Kyler too is he isn’t used to adversity. Kliff wasn’t good at rallying the troops when down. My hope is that Gannon will put the effort to keep them inspired and hold Kyler accountable for when things meltdown in game
Funny, this is what I've found too. We went for dinner last week and he just slept in his car seat. We are meeting friends tonight though and I know they'll wanna hold him, that's where it'll get dicey haha.
Good advice :P Yeah, no maxing until it's fully healed, gotta focus on that before strength in the bench.
My guess is soft. No more maxing for a while until the pain is gone.
What makes you think we don't tell them to begin with? We don't give out part numbers or any other info they can use, because our job isn't to give them what they need to get it somewhere else.  edit  I will add that there are circumstances in which we do. Discontinued parts or otherwise incredibly difficult to find parts, for example.

dunno man, there's multiple avenues to debt relief and whichever one works best for you is the best to do.  Snowball method is to take whatever the smallest debt is and focus on paying that debt off, regardless of interest, so that you can roll those payments into the next and the next and the next.  rationale being that seeing that incremental progress and increasingly large numbers being thrown at debt makes you feel good.  debt avalanche is tackling the highest interest debt first, then the next, then the next.  Strictly speaking its more optimal, but depending on the disparity in debt amounts there's also an advantage in having more of your monthly cash flow freed up that the snowball provides so that if something comes up you're more liquid in your ability to pay without having to use a credit card and dig yourself back into your hole.  anyways congrats on paying off your car, its a great feeling to not have a car payment!
Look at what your interest payments on your credit card is. Figure out what the APR is. If you have good enough credit that you can just walk into your bank and secure a loan with a better interest rate, do so immediately. Pay off the credit card debt with that, then pay that loan off as quick as possible. As long as you don't rebuild the debt on your credit card while paying off the loan it'll save you money.

Oh, no doubt, it reminds me of Braveheart: "I gave Mornay double his lands in Scotland and matching estates in England.... Lochlan turned for much less."  I just think it's important to be accurate about it, because the right likes to harp on a single factual error to dismiss entire arguments.
That's fair.  I think it's also important for everyone to understand that people like Phil Knight aren't Republicans or Democrats.  They're *wealthy* people.  Wealthy people don't pick sides, they just support whoever best maintains their wealth.

Would a hypothetical subject receive an adversarial hearing prior to losing their firearms?
Those are two of the worst possible options out there. Multiple issues across the board, not even counting the 2nd Amendment issues. Would you be in support of someone proposing a registry of every vote that someone has recorded or allowing someone to be arrested and disenfranchised without due process because someone felt they might vote for something dangerous?
Reminds me of when some Evangelicals got together in 2019 to pray for America to lose the Women's World Cup because Megan Rapinoe had the audacity to be homosexual and say she didn't like Donald Trump.  I guess God didn't give a shit, huh guys?
And these Republicans in backwater states calling emergency sessions where they focus all attention on immediately (with as much media whoring as possible) steamrolling bills against trans athletes over their state "crisis" of having a handful or less of trans athletes actually competing in something.   Absolutely nothing to do with the sanctity of sports or fairness or "protecting" women. It's all bullshit culture war politics and inventing a boogeyman/enemy and whipping up the religiously insane into a frenzy.
Tell them that life isn't fair and they can get used to it. Self harm and suicide prevention is more important than a high school sport.

If we're lucky, we'll never have a Republican president or Senate again.

I think the one encouraging thing is that the muscle comes back super quick. It’s cutting the weight that takes a long time and a lot of dedication.

Doesn't really matter to me, tbh. In person or on TV. Golf is boring as shit. The most excitement you'll get out of it is everybody quietly clapping. I've been to public libraries with a livelier atmosphere.

So have you just completely missed the part where they're openly banning books, trying to remove history from the classroom and weaponizing their state governments to punish private companies for holding views that hurt their feelings? Or are you just pretending that all isn't happening??

False equivalencies.
God probably gave a shit, it’s just that the US Women’s team is too good for even god to toy with. They had to beat their opponents and God and the evangelicals. They good!
It was very sad for the religiously insane MAGAs that year.   They also didn't even have a Russian Women's Team in it to cheer for.
This is such an insane take.

I want to abolish the US Senate, the Electoral College, and turn the US House into a Parliament. Our system of Government is so fucking stupid and arbitrary and slow and unresponsive.  Also, I hate to say it like this but... people born after 1980 or so are much, much less likely to vote Republican. Plus, they're generally very progressive. Under-40s are almost certainly why Brandon Johnson just won the mayoral election in Chicago. And just look at the last 3 midterms with a D President:  2010: R+6.8  2014: R+5.7  2022: R+2.8  I can't really think of any explanation besides Boomers starting to die off for the 2010 -> 2014 shift.

So you support putting The Turner Diaries in elementary school libraries?
When the first modern gun control laws were passed specifically with the intention of targeting the black panthers? Gun control remains racist (and classist as well while we're at it) due to its disproportionate impact on minorities and the poor by imposing financial and time barriers that people simply cannot meet. It's the exact same issue as with voter ID laws.
You'd feel this way if someone tried to include a bill banning abortion or the right to vote? You'd be ok with elected officials doing that and just accepting them proposing blatantly unconstitutional things? They should know that rights aren't for barter and then vote em out.
Not calling the other commenter racist, they've done nothing to make me say that nor do I know them. I AM calling the idiots advocating for gun control laws racist. Gun control has always been about racism, the entire modern gun control movement spawned off of restricting the black panthers.
Nah, you just disagree with one and not the other. Rights are rights, whether you like them or not. They're natural rights, protected by the constitution and specifically enumerated as such, and they should be protected heartily across the board.
It'll be tougher this time around. If the right does the same garbage and the US loses, I hope it's to a team that's so LGBT-focused that the TV audience goes rainbow-colored.
Nor this year. They'll probably go for the team that has issues with economic-based racial disparity, wide proliferation of guns, and lack of single-standard universal health care. South Africa, maybe.
"Self harm and suicide prevention is more important than a high school sport" being called an insane take is an insane take.
It’s tough out there
Glad it came off. I can't imagine that that would be super tasty after this long in storage but I'm not a scientist!  Stay safe and get some really good provalone!
It's fun. I usually switch between a couple different grandstands. I enjoy the atmosphere of the hyper-focused crowd going from dead silence to cheering.
In my experience, the clapping is slightly louder. I'm from Georgia. I've been to Augusta. You get a better view of what happens on TV. Golf is quite possibly the only sport that doesn't get better in person.

Oh there are certainly books that don't belong in schools. The Bible, for instance. There's one.  Also, are we pretending that the Turner Diaries is one of the books they're trying to have removed?
Today, is not then. The VAST majority of people cosplaying in military fatigues with scary looking guns and intimidating people are  not black and they are not poor. Today someone who wants to have red flag laws, limit magazine capacity, or have a waiting period are not racist, they just don’t want their families to die. This isn’t racism or classism to want these things.
No. I don’t. This is literally the reason we have a Constitution and courts that rule on what is & isn’t constitutional. Now, in a perfect world, we’d all be sane & reasonable to not elect these pro-life fuckwhits to begin with but while I vehemently disagree with them, I think the idea of banning people from office simply for holding views I disagree with is ludicrous.  Not to mention fascist…just like what we’re seeing in Tennessee right now.
I enjoy that you’ve spent this entire time acting like you’re a champion of rights and have several posts where you explicitly want abortions banned like this banger  “The constitution gives the right to have an abortion for personal reasons, it says nothing about anyone providing them. I do think the majority of abortions should be prohibited.“  Big time personal rights advocate.
Wrong.
Making votes public record doesn’t violate anybodies rights. People being arrested without due process is a false equivalency to gun control.
I'd say someone saying they're going to kill themselves if they can't dominate women's sports is insane.   Women deserve to compete with their peers.  If i decided to change genders in high school I would have every track record in the books for girls, nationally.   You really think telling them "all hey life isn't fair" is cool?  Only people who've never competed in a sport agree with you.

So you support banning books.
Good intentions don't just magically fix useless things and make their negative impact better. People who want voter ID laws also think they'll do something positive and have good intentions, but they are still both detrimental and ineffective. It's still unintentionally problematic.
You know what, you're right. My response wasn't particularly well thought out and was a gut reaction response to a frustrating situation. I don't like seeing our rights constantly under attack, but the correct response isn't to get heavy handed, it's to appropriately use the system. Reject via vote and not let things stand. It's not appropriate and I appreciate that reminder.
Thorough argument... If you'd like to read about the origin of modern gun control and its decidedly racist roots, feel free to look up the Mulford Act. It is absolutely correct, the start of the modern gun control movement was because black people armed themselves and the government and white folks didn't like that.
So you'd be completely fine with every vote you've ever recorded be public record and available to search? We have private ballots for a reason. Can you explain what makes you say it's a false equivalency? Because the whole concept of red flag laws is to take away someone's rights without due process. That's not a false equivalence, that's EXACTLY what is being talked about.
Well, that's not what was said, you decided on your own what context to add to it, but I would agree, the take that you invented in your head and then ascribed to someone else is, indeed, insane.

If they're pornographic & encourage violence & hatred, like the Bible, then they don't really have any place in school. But that's not what they're advocating...
I never said the three solutions I mention as examples will fix anything (I’m also not saying they won’t). My point is you claimed racism/classism, and all I’m saying, and it should have been clear, is that wanting those things isn’t racist or classist...it’s people who fear the impact of guns on them, their loved ones or their community. The effectiveness of these solutions is moot to this conversation and not something I’m here to discuss.
It is all good, my dude. This stuff frustrates me just as much as it does you. Good on you for taking a moment to breathe and coming to a better place.
So we should not curb gun violence through legislation now because it was used to enact racist goals decades ago?
[removed]
Well, in their estimation they're banning pornographic material.   You also concede that the government possesses authority to curate the content students access in public schools. You just dislike the people making the decisions.
And my point is, just because you have good intentions, doesn't negate the negatives that they cause. People can have unintentionally racist views. Folks who want voter ID laws want safer elections that can be trusted, it doesn't change the fact that what they advocate has detrimental racist consequences.
I'm saying that we should enact laws that would actually make a difference and not ones that have racist roots, are actively useless and malicious, and are still actively racist.

Still glad D. Ware got his ring
Lots of players legitimately love the old coot. Dez was burning bridges and lashing out at people on his way out of Dallas but was still hanging out in Jerry's box for a concert a few months later.
A player that hates Jerry is very rare once they play for him, he pays well and goes all out on facilities.
I’m not Jerry’s biggest fan but in videos like this he really reminds me of my old Texas born-and-raised grandpa. That elderly southern charm hits hard. Only if my gramps had as much money on this mf’er he’d spend it on a couple thousand cases of bud light and a small parking lot of Dodge Rams.
Could you imagine them kissing?
I actually see a genuine smile on both their faces when they hug at the end so that's nice at the very least.
KISS! KISS! KISS!
No one can deny that Jerry absolutely loves his players
Fucking love Ware. Total badass on and off the field, well deserved gold jacket and love that he chose Jerry for this.
You can never say that Jerry doesn't love his guys.
Reminder that Jerry was also the one who told DeMarcus he was making the HoF too: https://youtu.be/dm2BhFJaHrY?t=62
When Ware played for the Broncos, him and Von Miller were regularly nearby each other.  Von is a huge man but Ware made Von look tiny.
So much love but had to leave the team to actually get his ring lol
My favorite Cowboys of all time, he was obviously a HoFer on the field but people around Dallas knew that knew that he was an even better person in the community. Pure class personified.
Who did he win one with?
To bad it was in the broncos
Yeah Jerry gets a lot of flack but most former and current players loved him because he was loyal... at times TOO loyal but what can you do.  I rather have an owner that treats their players well than like shit (ahem Snyder)
Honestly this type of behavior just makes Jerry's rift with Jimmy Johnson that much more confusing.
Hes a piece of shit whos meddling has prevented ANY meaningful success by the franchise in decades but sure just call him a lovable old coot and move on 🙄
He actually seems to genuinely care about his players
The only players I can remember making negative comments about Jerry specifically also had other major issues going on - David Irving and Michael/Martellus Bennet come to mind
except for the training room and team travel accommodations
I mean I *could*, i just prefer not to.
When the video finished playing “Now kiss.” was my only thought.  Do you think a kiss from Jerry would be unusually dry or unusually wet?
Stop reading my diary
One bonk for you, pal!
Ware is built like a Greek god, but if I remember reading right Ware really set Von straight. I loved seeing him ball out in the Superbowl he deserved that ring
Ahh yes tell me about a 49er or Panther that is in the HOF that won a SB with your team in the past 25 years.   Go on, I'll wait.
Him and Witten for me  Sucks we never did right by them (on the field) but happy at least ware got his ring
Broncos
How'd it get in there?
There have to be so, so many benefits in having a guy as connected as Jerry legitimately care about you too.
As a non-Cowboys fan, it sure seems like Jerry loves the team, wants to win, and seems to support his players.    Whenever people lump him in with Snyder or other "bad" owners, I scratch my head.  I think you could do a lot worse than having Jerry as your owner.
Sort of? Two stubborn guys who'd known each other for decades, both with egos who both wanted things done the way they wanted them done. Seemed pretty inevitable they were going to clash.
He sees Jimmy as a threat, but not his former players
You should probably cry a bit more, see if that helps
A great example of that is Tyron Smith. His family was massively taking advantage of him during his first few years in the league and Jerry helped him overcome that and protect himself.  Jerry can be insane, but he cares about his guys to a fault.
>Michael/Martellus Bennet  Which is weird, because they usually only have positive things to say about their former teams 🙄
Don’t lie you’d watch
Truth hurts eh?
He was dominant in that playoff run too. Him and Von Miller were bullying the Pats line in that AFC championship game.
Trojan horse
10 percent luck
He signed with them
To a fault? Like it’s bad?
I’d record.
Id do more than watch  Id also record
That defense made me question my heterosexuality about the offensive side of football.
20 percent skill
Woooosh
That must have been a wild contract.
Sure, new contracts long past a players prime, betting on "his" guys has been one of his bigger downfalls.
Like giving Zeke a 2nd contract, or Jaylon Smith.
Bad from a team sense yes, like others have mentioned a big example is the Zeke contract.  But not bad in general no, it's great to see someone who owns a team be so clearly passionate about their employees and team.
He loves his guys so much he salts their McGriddles
Watching 2015/6 Broncos defense highlights is pure beauty. So many hard hitters and ballhawks on that team
15 percent concentrated power of will
100 percent concentrated power of will
Zeke not deserving a 2nd contract is revisionist history. He was 24 years old and was the most productive back in the league when he received that contract.
Lmfao
Them, LOB, and the Ravens are my favorite defenses of that decade.
Was your 2016 defense good enough for a Super Bowl run if you had Manning another year?
5 percent pleasure
Hard to say, we lost some key guys in FA, and Manning was barely functioning by that point
"180 ml Blue Label" - John Elway
This is conflating cap and cash when they don't track at all, particularly early in the contract
I don't think anything football related annoys me more than when people who know how football works express shock (real or fake) that a team could sign free agents and still have cap space for the current season.  Very few free agents sign with big cap hits in the first year. Also, 155M over the lifetime of 13 contracts is really not that much, and again the total life of the contracts has very little bearing on the cap hit for this season.
>$155+M over life of the contracts  This is irrelevant in terms of 2023 cap space though. Its not like theyre paying $155m in just 2023 on those deals. Why wouldnt you just say theyre paying "X" to free agents in 2023 and still have the 2nd most cap?
This is like being amazed at buying a house without 300k in cash.
We need actual sports journalism bc we all know those players are getting like....65 million of that before getting cut
A Burns extension could free up even more cap space. The Panthers are in a decent position financially for the first time in a long time, and I don't know how to react.
Panthers been killing it lately
Click bait for people who don't understand contracts.
Yay.
Everyone knows that the salary cap is voodoo magic
Yeah, this is total bs. Anyone that follows this sport knows that going by total contract value and total contract lengths is meaningless except when doing cap management.  The most important things that matter is the cash payout at signing, guaranteed money at signing (it is important to look at vesting schedule and don't get tricked by rolling guaranteed money), and dead cap. The first two because it is how much a team actually is spending up front and the last because that is what protects a player from just getting cut before rolling guarantees lock in during a league year and it also gives an indication of how long the contract actually is in practice since it is cost prohibitive to a team to cut bait when the dead cap number is high.
They don't have their starting qb signed yet. Is anyone surprised at this?
They ran laps around bears
As an OSU fan, Hope Stroud gets his money if they get him
In b4 we sign all the best free agents left to 1 year contracts and win the Super Bowl
Jeremy you measure with cap hit, not cash paid.
Jeremy Fowler is such a dumb piece of crap
And the worst talent
Who has the first most 😏
Carolina pays their players. Can't take that away from them
The more you know about contracts and the salary cap the more you realize they do this all. the. time.
Yep, that "$155+M" only counts for about $31 million against their 2023 cap
But it gets the people going!
Not to mention it's pretending that all of those contracts will be paid out completely
Like, if they're all 3yr deals that means those 13 players would be getting ~50m a year, or about a quarter of the cap. Totally reasonable.
No one ever seems to do it, but the panthers feel like a team that would be smart to have pushed more of that money into this season.  They might win their division cause it's soft, but they're going to draft a rookie QB and aren't really a contender this year most likely, you think they'd max it out and have more space later.  Saying that, they'll probably (hopefully) spend whatever is left on free agents or other contracts.
Because then it wouldn't be talked about.
To me the point of the tweet was to show how much the Panthers have revamped their team but still have cap left. But even in that case it makes more sense to say "they signed 13 players and still have lots of cap space"  13 players of 155 mil over several years isn't actually a lot, each player averages 12 mil for an entire contract that could be multiple years and isn't fully guaranteed
Something something guaranteed contracts are selfish these poor owners
wouldn't you rather them push as much into this year as possible capwise, and have more space in the following years.  Drafting a rookie QB you're probably a year away, might be able to win your division this year anyways, but having more space in years 2-5 if your QB hits would be sweet.  Everyone has to hit a certain % of the cap, but feels like everyone always backloads contracts when sometimes frontloading seems like it'd be great for the future.
That's with almost 50 million in dead cap thos year.
Hopefully it shows up on the field but this is the most optimistic I've been since early 2017. It really feels like they're trying to build a team the right way for sustained success. I'm a huge fan of Fitterer. Next step is hitting on the QB pick...
For all the extremely fair complaints about Rhule very much not being the guy, you do have to admit that he did very little to sacrifice the team's future with bad long-term contracts or huge draft capital giveaways. In fact, the further you get away from his tenure, the more it will fade into obscure trivia night info that he was even there.
It will be a rookie on a rookie deal.  So not gonna eat up a ton
Would the best free agents left really move the needle that much?
And if you think about it, it makes perfect sense that they would in the vast majority of cases.  Cap almost always goes up, and you can roll over cap space.  You almost always want to do back loaded deals unless you're running up against the minimum spending threshold and need to get in compliance with that.
The more I learn about contracts and salary cap the more I feel like I have no fucking clue about contracts and salary cap.
We're keeping space in order to extend Brian Burns after the draft, and odds are high that we frontload that deal.  It's a far better use of our remaining cap space, plus every FA deal we signed this year was for a max of 3 years. The plan is to secure the QB of the future now, lock up the draft picks we hit big on in the next few years w/ extensions (Burns, Derrick Brown, Jeremy Chinn, etc.) then take stock of where we're at in three years, and either go all-in with the QB we drafted for the last couple years of his rookie deal or restart the process if we feel like he's not the answer.  It's a pretty sound strategy tbh
There is a massive Burns extension coming probably after the draft that’s gonna eat some Cap. I have been a fan for a long time and this is one of the better free agency periods we’ve had. I think if there was a top tier WR in free agency we would have gone all in for them.
As it shouldn’t be
The NFL has a salary floor, where teams must spend 89% of their cap over a 4 year period, and the NLF must spend 95% of the cap each year as a whole.  The owners aren't really saving any money without guaranteed contracts, they're just saving money they can use on other players.  if contracts were all fully guaranteed you'd just see shorter length contracts without those bullshit years on the end.
They already kinda have. The Panthers don't have too many big contracts on their books and have a ton of cap space moving forward. Burns is the big one they still have to take care of, but they have a ton of flexibility in the future.
Panthers have a lot of cap in 2024 like a lot of teams. A burns extension will eat into that as well as a Derrick brown extension but they’d still be set up pretty well to be very aggressive in FA with a rookie contract and a decent team in place.
It's reasonably well balanced over the next 3 years tbh. Next year as things stand, there's $86m in Cap Space and 2025 has $169m in space (as things stand.)  Whilst that is obviously going to need looking at bigger picture (a couple of big contract extensions will come due then) that is an incredibly healthy place to be considering we're (hopefully) about to draft our Franchise QB for the next 10 years too.
Ahhh every year they give me hope only to crush it. Hopefully this years diffrent
Offseason champions
Rhule wasn’t the GM.  Our GM hasn’t changed.   Don’t give him credit
I know.  I'm just saying that they're not paying 40m+ to a QB... is it surprising that they've got some great cap space?
In this scenario yes
That part of the issue, though in my opinion the real problem is counting non-guaranteed money as earned on signing - which it, as "non-guaranteed" money, obviously isn't.
or if you have an opportunity with a cheap cap deal like they did with Jimmy G at the start of his 49ers contract, and figure "lets go now while the team is less good, pay Jimmy for a big part of the deal early, so it's cheaper later
What do you mean that you can roll over cap?   If cap is 300M and I only use 250M this year, that doesn’t mean I get 350M next year as far as I know…. I’m a little confused by your comment and just want to make sure that I’m not misunderstanding something important  Edit: interesting. Didn’t know you could roll over unused cap to a certain %. Thanks for the clarification!
I bet you understand it more than you think, the mechanics in place are fairly straight forward.
If you guys hit on the qb you must feel your future is pretty bright cause the rest of your division seems like a mess, especially at qb.
Yes. Good. They should be like that so that the contract numbers match reality.
I was looking at the top all-time r/nfl "Panthers" posts today. Everything was from the last 4 years. Holy fuck man, it's been rough.
Hopefully we can look back and say the recent disappointment was 100% on Rhule
Alright I'm open to it. Who's available that gets them over the hump?
Yup, one of the few times that made perfect sense and it was really smart that they recognized it and did what they could to take advantage of it.
Afaik that is how it works, but the teams must declare how much cap space they are rolling over. See this [poorly written article](https://www.si.com/nfl/browns/news/a-look-at-the-cleveland-browns-rollover-cap-space-from-2022)
You can roll over cap. ~~Only a max of 11% tho~~, so if the salary cap is 300 million, you can only roll over 33 million and use 333 million the next year (assuming the cap stays flat).  Edit: The limit is that you have to spend a minimum of 89% of the cap in **cash**, not cap, so it's actually a bit more complicated, and teams have rolled over more than 11%.
Basically if the cap is 300M, and then next year it's 325M, and then the year after that it's 350M, and then more after that,  you can sign someone to a deal that is back loaded and that deal won't actually be bad due to the increase in cap (also the back loaded portion is likely non-guaranteed)
yep that's def the feeling rn haha
I am just keeping my cool for now.  I was Kerry Collins’ed once.  So I keep the expectations low until it happens.
All the free agents fused together into one
OBJ, Frank Clark and Marcus Peters/Ronald Darby on one-year deals would shore up positions of need and allow more flexibility in the draft. Not sure it gets us “over the hump” but a division title wouldn’t surprise me
OBJ and one of Clowney, Ngakoue or Clark, and Rock Ya-Sin would go a long, long way towards it. Not realistic at all though
The more you know. Huh. Thanks!
Didn't realize the cap was 11%, so definitely an added reason to balance between backloading the contracts.
> Edit: The limit is that you have to spend a minimum of 89% of the cap in cash, not cap, so it's actually a bit more complicated, and teams have rolled over more than 11%.  This is evaluated over a 3 year window too, for all the kids following along at home, so you can see more than this for a single year
This isn't true.  There is a minimum amount of cash that has to be spent every few years. It is a separate calculation from the cap.  https://www.spotrac.com/nfl/cleveland-browns/cap/  The browns carried over more than 12% of the cap
Right. I understand that. But the other commenter said that “you can roll over cap space” which is either something that I’m misunderstanding or incorrect. As far as I know, you cannot roll over unused cap space from one year to the next
"I AM THE BEST FREE AGENTS."
Also an important note is it is not a rolling 3 years, they have set periods. I’m not sure what they are anymore but like 21-23 could be one. The next would be 24-26.
Teams can screw around with this too if they don't hit the spending floor since the only penalty to it IIRC is that they must meet the difference and pay their players with make up payments at the end of set period.  It isn't a big deal because a team can just go sign a high priced free agent or do a big money extension to star players with a huge signing bonus and pretty much meet their obligations.
Jags also rolled over more than 12% in 2022, and in 2021 teams rolled over a dump truck of cap across the board with the Browns rolling over more than 16%.
Ah, you're right, I conflated the two. It does mean that in practical terms there's only so much cap you carry over, but 11% is absolutely not the max.
You can indeed!
Yes, unused cap space can be rolled over to the next league year. This has been a thing for over a decade now. I believe since the 2011 CBA.  It’s fairly easy to find information. There is a cap floor you have to spend up to within any given range of years, so there’s limits on how much can be rolled over in any given time.
You can't, I think he just misspoke and meant that since the cap constantly increases so you can essentially roll over cap space in practice
Not automatically because cash and cap are not the same thing.  Drew brees counted on the cap for the saints for 11.5m last season but that cash was paid in 2020 (or before) so it counts as 0 cash when calculating if the saints paid out 90% of the cap amount in cash from the 2021-2023 seasons.
No. They need to make *cash payments* equivalent to 89% of the cap over that 4 year period.   For example a signing bonus of $50M paid in the 4th year counts fully towards that 89% even though the cap “spent” can be amortized over the entire contract and into the next 4 year period.   This includes “salary conversion” bonus payments as well, which count fully towards the 89% cash spend rule but are often used to free cap space via amortization.
So hypothetically, I could cut my entire roster, sign 50 vet minimums, roll over 95% of my cap space, and then the following season I’d have 2x the total cap of all the other teams? I’m pretty sure that’s not the case. Do you have a source on being able to roll over unused cap from one year to the next?
Yes you can, you're giving misinformation.   >NFL teams are allowed to roll over any unused cap space from one season to the next. Clubs must tell the league they plan to roll over cap space by 4 p.m. ET on the day after their regular-season finale.  It's part of the whole reason there's a spending floor, for a minimum amount you have to spend. That way teams aren't rolling over too much cap space.
Great! That’s what I wanted to clarify
You have to spend up to a certain amount each year so you could not do that. Once you spend over the threshold you do get to carry over whatever is left unspent over that.
Blud asking for a source on something thats been around for over 10 years and regularly talked about.  https://www.nbcsports.com/chicago/bears/bears-rolling-over-4th-most-cap-space-2022-2023-nfl-season
It got instituted a few CBAs ago, but you can only roll 11% I believe. There's also a salary floor you have to meet.
There is a hard cap on the percentage of one years cap that you can roll over to the next year.
They are incorrect, you can roll over unused cap space. But that's why there's a spending floor to make sure teams aren't rolling over too much cap space year over year.
I’m on this sub nearly every day, so clearly it isn’t talked about that regularly. I edited my original comment to reflect the correct information. No reason to be an ass about it. Not everyone can know everything
Yep, I was wrong. Thanks for the help!
I apparently share the same opinions on skill position players as the Falcons front office, because goddamn did I want both Drake London and Kyle Pitts.
I remember Eagles fans were convinced this guy was JJAW 2.0 because they said he "couldn't get separation in college"   Glad to see him prove people wrong, he's legit
A lotta Drake London clips lately
Damn who is that corner? Very unlucky to give up that catch, that is excellent coverage.
This guy can play. Hopefully more people will notice next season when better passes come his way.
My dynasty fantasy team needs these highlights
10 of Ridder’s 97 passing yards that game
He's good
Ridder started feeding London in his first 4 starts. London is going to have a huge tear if Ridder plays all season. Hopefully he will also get the ball to Pitts too.
I personally think Desmond ridder got hooked up…and he was pretty good last year as a rookie.
A QB will be walking into a great situation with London, Pitts, and Allgeier whoever that QB may be!
Hesse got the hands ready
As a football fan: that was a great catch. As a bucs fan: that was luck.
I swore for a second there it was a 2020 highlight  whenever I saw not a single fan in that highlight   That being said. I didn't want to touch drake London. He did his thing and impressed me last year. Hope to see how Arthur uses him in year 2
Our subreddit certainly didn't.
He produced decently on a team that had both ARSB and Michael Pittman Jr, he gonna be fine at worst
If I remember from his highlights, he was pretty open but the QB underthrew the ball. Could be misremembering, it’s been a while since I looked at those clips.
We got London on the track
All from the same dude
Taylor.  Hes really good, drafted 2nd round 2022
Alontae Taylor
When better passes are thrown *to* him and not *in his general direction*.  Mariota over threw him so bad...aimed for London, but damn near hit Paris
40% of London’s yards came from the 4 games Ridder started.   That’s how bad Mariota was.
Tough defense to go against in your first pro game. He got better each week.
My fav play of this game is ridder running out of bounds to end the game .
I'm still trying to figure out why it looks like they're in slow motion at the start of the play. Did Ridder fake the handoff in the wrong direction? Patterson looked like he wasn't expecting to run that direction. Can definitely tell this was Ridder's first game haha
Ridder season babee
He tried? The ball is placed too far in front of the receiver for the DB behind him to make a play. Sometimes you have good coverage and the catch gets made anyway.
Maybe if he dives, in which case London can catch and turn up field for a lot more yardage.   Diving was about the only chance he had.
Team subreddits are the second lowest form of intelligence on the planet right above Twitter. Never go there
He was a monster the year after ARSB got drafted when he was the number 1 mouth.  USC has been pumping out talented receivers. They got some great ones currently too. It’s like they’re just churning out a really good NFL receiver every year and replacing him
Yeah, Falcons had (deservedly) 0 highlights posted from their last 4 games of the season on this subreddit, but London had some really impressive games imo. Thought I'd show the team had a bright spot
When mariota heard sun for the stars he took it too literally and over threw every 6-6 receiver
Oof
For a while, it seemed like it was the Tee Martin pipeline, but we've been churning out great WRs even after he left
Off-season study has made me love Drake so much more
Nah he looked really good in preseason + those last four games of the season (doesn't show how well he played on the stat sheet). Falcons setting up for a really solid 10 and 7 or so season next year.
Nobody knows since no one watched the last 4 falcons game which is totally fair, but Ridder improved every game. He literally had better stats than Matt Ryan’s first 4 games.    Obviously I don’t expect him to be a world beater or a top qb, just that I think he is (or will be) better than what ppl think
"Matt Patricia isn't here"
A Vikings fan was talking shit in a different thread a few weeks ago "your best receiver was Marvin Jones during those years lol"  Damn right, and we love him for it
God I love how much everyone utterly despised Matt Patricia's time here.  I don't think I've ever seen a fanbase just absolutely LOATHE a former coach like we loathe Patricia.
Man I’m not used to the lions getting this much offseason hype  It makes me feel weird to have actual expectations for the lions
Megatron died for this :(
Gotta love that moment when everyone starts accepting "something has changed here" and start taking the team seriously.  Enjoy the ride Cat Boys, soon you'll be the villain.
Loved MJJ, hope he kills it again for you Lion bros.
Lions please win the NFCN and a playoff game. Your team is too beloved not to
It feels like teams need true rehabilitation after going through a failing Belichick/Patriots disciple. The Giants went through something similar with Judge and are now finding redemption in Daboll. Hopefully, for the Raiders' sake, they can eventually see the light and send McDaniels back to where he came from, like they all do in the end. Good for the Lions though. Glad to see it 👍
I don’t know if Dan Campbell will ultimately be the coach to get them to the top of the NFL, but you can’t deny from the coaching staff to the FO they are doing almost everything right.  They have set themselves right after such a long time of being at the bottom.  Everything they are doing is just smart. If Dan is not the guy, the next one could be it if they continue this track.  Happy for you NFC North Bros.
I just learned we got Marvin Jones back! Let's go!. Loved him when he was here.
Y’all look so different
Even the fans are different.  Been a fan for 30+ years and there certainly has been an influx of newbies the last 6 months.
Jared Goff throwing to Marvin Jones. This Cal fan is a lions fan now!
Marvin Jones, a true cat bro
Woah I didn’t realize he returned. One of my favorite players on that lions roster all those years ago. Happy he’s back.
Compared to pencil ear?  Yes I’m sure it’s quite a bit different
Thanks for loaning him out! God speed this season Big Cat Bros
Calvin next. Plz.
It’s different AND it’s not the same
Wait till you finish retracing your steps to Cincinnati.
Jones is one of the most respected WRs in the locker room. He's seen it all (Patricia & Meyer). Great signing for both player & team
Matty P in shambles
The Lions fan base is second only to Bills Mafia as fan bases I would love to see get a ring outside my own team (and may overtake Buffalo).
What Matt patricia does to a mfer...
This has Geno Smith 2.0 all over it.
Same owner... see Jerry Jones for reference
I wish we could’ve kept him, but I know why we didn’t (Ridley)
👀 not a bad pickup at all
The sheer difference between the Patricia-Quinn era and the MCDC/Holmes era is absolutely insane.    You can just tell from the surface level how toxic the Patricia regime was and how therapeutic, healthy, and remedial Campbell's tenure has been.  Like the growing pains were there with Campbell but now we're finally seeing the fruits.    Those fruits being an incredibly fun, young, underdog of a team.   A team with a culture and identity that builds bridges, rather than burning them.   A team that any fan can get behind.
Now he is in Foxboro ruining our rookie Qb with Belichick
“A noticeable lack of decorum and respect for the process. Why can’t the beat reporters sit up straight?”
I’m so happy Campbell is panning out. I went into last year worried he was gonna be another case of “guy who is great at everything except for being the actual head coach”.
Hope the same will happen in Vegas after McDaniels leaves.
Weird to disrespect Marvin. We all fear him.
That's weird. MJJ did nothing but destroy us constantly  Never forget catching us with 12 on the field, so the extra corner doubled MJJ and he scored anyway
That dude was delusional. Marvin Jones was excellent with you guys. Hope he can go back to his old ways this year  Make Marvin Great Again
He had some crazy catches
Marvin is awesome. Loved him when he was on the bengals and time and time again he has shown he is a great professional
That's hilarious tbh.
He was good there though?
Low key, as a patriots fan, really liking Dan Campbell and the lions. Pats nation till I die, but I don’t mind low key rooting for the lions. Also, F fat Matt P.   Also, Swift has “swiftly” moved into the never draft again list for my fantasy team.
Marvins a G
We love him too
Lions fans      Patriots fans                  🤝       Hating Fat Patricia
Greg Schiano, Urban Meyer, and Bobby Petrino  come to mind in terms of how hated they were. Patricia makes the Mount Rushmore.
hey, do me a favor, just kind of sit up and just like, have a little respect for the process. every day you come in here and post reddit comments and you just kind of like, you know, give me this. but i mean, like, just be a little respectf- just, i'm asking to be a little respectful in this whole process okay?
Urban Meyer in Jacksonville is probably the most comparable
As an exiled Brownie I can testify the levels of hate for Hue Jackson in Cleveland are decently close
The Urban Meyer train wreck still echoes
Urban Meyer is a veeeeeery close second
Chip Kelly is despised and trashed all the time in philly, its funny cause he wasnt truly THAT bad
no one likes a football terrorist
Maybe Hue Jackson?
Tyrell Crosby was weirdly ok with him
I remember the first notable thing that happened after he got hired was his sexual assault/rape case getting uncovered. And Quinn still went ahead with him. I knew literally immediately it was gonna be a shitshow
We are fortunate enough to not have a former coach bad enough to loathe 😅
Adam Gase comes close
pats fans after last year re getting there
Urban Meyer says hi.
Bill O’Brien with the Texans after the DHop trade was pretty hated.
Probably not so much anymore but Vikings fans over a certain age *despise* Les Steckel.
> I don't think I've ever seen a fanbase just absolutely LOATHE a former coach like we loathe Patricia.  Wish it hadn't taken him getting fired for our fans to figure it out, but at least everyone finally got there.
I wonder if he's including Caldwell in there too.  The Lions had winning seasons but they were pretty undisciplined and made mistakes it looks like this team has cleaned up.
It’s not football, but everyone in the NBA hated Luke Walton
Jets fan here… idk I think Adam gase comes close
The Falcons hate Bobby Petrino for being a gutless coward that lacks any vertebrae.
Maybe we'll go 4-0 in the preseason like 2008!
Will be interesting to see if their late season improvement on defense will hold up next year. Playing against the Lions D was fantasy gold for most of last year.
Legitimately probably the most hype I’ve seen for a Lions team since maybe 2012. I remember they had their first playoff appearance in what felt like forever under Gym Schwarts and people thought they’d make another step the next year. Then they didn’t.  Granted I think they have much better structure in place this time
I'm so excited for their Wild Card loss after dominating the NFCN.  Only thing that would make it better is it being St the hands of the 8 seed Bears. My buddy is a huge Lions fan and has been talking sooooo much shit since last year. Don't tell him, but I'm legit excited for the Lions to do well. Really, anyone other than the Packers....
>Cat Boys  Homie, we’re bros r/lakeeriebros
lmao what? Detroit isn't gonna be the villain this decade I guarantee it. Rams won a superbowl, how come they aren't villains?
Lets wait until they win a division title first
I'm predicting 4 seed with a home lose to Dallas in the wild card.
It seems like the Browns just moved on to harder drugs after Romeo Crennel.
I think Campbell is smarter with X's and O's than people give him credit for. He's actually shown significant improvement in that area this year, and he's honest with the media and his team in how he specifically needs to keep getting better.
Hopefully this year Dan Campbell doesn’t make those game management decisions that cost the team wins. His schtick will get old without getting to the playoffs.
a lot of them were just hibernating
Winning changes things.  I became a fan in 2016 because of some clutch wins from Stafford, Jones, and Golden Tate.  The Patricia years were hard to watch.  Also Jamaal Williams probably made the team new fans all on his own.
I started watching football as a  Brady fan and being a redwings fan, the team to root for with Brady retired seems obvious now.
Marvin also dealt with Urban Meyer. He had some really shitty coach luck for several years.
Subscribe
Matt Patricia is not a big fan of fruit.
the fact that motor city dan campbell is a thing, and not like a rip on him, should tell us how his team and area view him.  i bet patricia was viewed like a dude who moved chevy production to mexico
It is so satisfying to get rid of such a toxic coach for a coach who actually builds a winning culture. The Jags going from Meyer to Pederson and Lions going from Patricia to Campbell has been so refreshing. I am rooting for our catbros. Id love to be good at the same time as the Lions.
If the 49ers don't win the nfc championship, I would want either the lions or commies (because I'm from Virginia) to win it. MCDC and Brad have built an amazing culture in a short amount of time.
I still worry that the lions will hit the same wall they did with Caldwell and respond the same way even if they get stuck at the transition from winning team to contender for different reasons
As a Bills fan, it does remind me of when Beane and McDermott took over the team in 2017.  The Bills went 20 goddamn years without making the playoffs but we had a few players that were holdovers from those days, and many of them made similar comments about the culture change.    When they came in we had some growing pains, but also evolved into the easy to root for underdogs (which has now changed but isn’t the worst problem to have) and we’re now set up for a sustained run.  Good things ahead for the Lions.
Even if Dan ends up not working out long term as a head coaching option, you also know a LOT of teams and other Head Coaches have noticed what he's doing.  That dude is set to go from now on. Tons of places would be thrilled to have a guy like him in their room working with them.
Wasn't  last year Macs 2nd year in the league?
right? Didnt he pull 4 TDs in a game once against the Vikes?
Marvin Jones was the OG Tee Higgins. A really good WR2 for the Bengals who could be a WR1 for a number of teams.
12 on the field plus DPI in double coverage, scores anyway  Edit: I misremembered this play from 5 years ago slightly, the second flag was roughing the passer, and it got picked up.
God, that was gorgeous. My wife is only a casual fan of football and she wanted to watch it about 10 times before I went back to the live feed.
He was plenty good this season for the jags, he just unfortunately got the short end of the stick with the Ridley trade. Absolutely a great professional and veteran who helped build our locker room and culture this year tho.
Especially against the Vikings lol
I’m gonna miss him on the jags. He was the toughness the WR core needed. He took a shot to the head in one of our colts games and got up flexing on the dude who did it. He still has great hands and agility so he’s gonna kill it with the lions. Hope nothing but the best for him
At Cal, he stayed around on the field and jumped up and high fived every fan that stuck around the tunnel after the game. I got a high five too. He must’ve jumped and high fived like 30 times LOL. He is an awesome human being.
Well that formatted like dog shit when I posted it
And that stupid pencil
"He's a gutless bastard. Quote that. I don't give a shit."    - Mike Zimmer on Bobby Petrino
I don't remember Greg Schiano that well, what was his deal that made him so bad?
Can't forget Fatt Rhule
Always thought it was weird how much he harped on things like dress code and posture while being a fat slob.
His defenders were funny. I remember telling one that Campbell would get his 10th win before Meyer.   Then Meyer got fired before the next game so it was kinda a wash.
Fatt Rhule too
The only reason Patricia is first is because he lasted almost three seasons. If Urban lasted atleast two he would be first and it wouldn't be close.
Chip Kelly at least had the balls to try his own ideas. They didn't work out the way he wanted but that's just kinda how it goes when you try something new. Patricia just tried to be Bill and make detroit Foxborough lite.
You guys ran out of ketchup for the 2nd half of a game at heinzs stadium. I dont know how that fits into this discussion but everytime I see a steelers flair I just can't stop thinking about it.
Not trade. It was a donation.
Oh boy perfect record here we come!
That would be crazy! Especially considering there are only 3 preseason games now.
You shut the fuck up satan
They invested in a secondary, I think they have a decent shot at double digit wins if not the division
Hypothetically, the defense should take a step. They've gotten a lot better in the secondary, but haven't really touched the LBs. It seems likely they'll probably upgrade the DL during the draft, though.
I mean that’s not really correct. Her mother was the owner until 2019 when Sheila took over for the 2020 season. Her first big move was firing dumb and dumber and hiring our current staff.  Calvin has come out and said the organization is mending the relationship under new ownership.  EDIT: since guy deleted the comment… he was saying that we were unfortunately still owned by Martha Ford who was in part responsible for the strained relationship between Calvin and the Lions
Poor Megatron having to pay back a small part of his signing bonus when he retired halfway through his contract
This is incorrect. The daughter is owner, and much more invested.
Factually incorrect
If its any consolation, had you said to us "Enjoy the ride dirtbags" we wouldn't be offended lol.
Cause they suck now
Cause they have like 12 fans that actually care
Everyone rooted for the Patriots to beat the Rams in the 2001 Super Bowl because they were a huge underdog. They were the darling team of American sports when they won that game.  Things change.  We got good. America got sick of it. It's a tale as old as time.
My dude, there is an ebb and flow to everything in life. Your team was amazing for like 30 years straight. Eventually other teams build good rosters and contend. What they are doing in Detroit is very promising.
c'mon man
shit, I'm with you.  the steps we took last year were great, but we've hung off-season champs banners before.  the team does feel different, but I'd like some results and consistency to go along with that.
This shouldn’t be downvoted. I like the Lions and think they’re on the upswing but let’s wait for them to be good for at least one full season before they’re crowned.
We’re winning the division, but aren’t better than the nfcs champ? I refuse to believe
I can see the refs picking up those pass interference flags.
Ewwwwww
I’m not going to claim he’s Andy Reid or Sean McVay but he’s definitely underrated as an X’s and O’s guy. He played in the league for a long time, worked his way through the coaching ranks, and then was a trusted offensive assistant to Sean Payton. Our offense was *terrible* to start the year in 2021, Dan took over playcalling midway through the year and offense all of a sudden was much better down the stretch. The ‘rah rah’ stuff is what makes him fun and I think it’s massively important for the culture building but he’s got a resume that shows he’s not the dumb meathead some people perceive him as (and he kind of plays into the stereotype).
you don't become Sean Payton's assistant head coach by being a meathead
IDK how smart he is but he's definitely much smarter than he lets people think he is. I sort of think he's like Andy Reid in that way, not in that he's as smart as Reid but Andy also has this "I'm just a big dumb guy who only cares about food" personality that he plays up big time. I think DC does the same thing.   "I said this to Chris (Spielman) the other day, I was like, 'I love the fact we're only known as meatheads,'" Campbell said via MLive in a recent interview. "I'm a meathead? I have limited brain capacity? I like (that people think) that. I'm good with that, you know what I mean? I have zero problem with it."   That was a quote like a month after his introductory "kneecap biting" press conference.
Seems like that aspect of him got substantially better second half of the year.
>	His schtick will get old without getting to the playoffs.  I don’t really get how this is different from any other coach. Do you mean there are other coaches who you’d want to keep even if they kept missing the playoffs?
I dont see how anyone could say or question that, that watched his execution in the green bay game. It was a masterclass as well as his decisions during the 8-2 run.
The last time the Lions kept a coach for a fourth year if they didn't make the playoffs in their first 3 was back in the 70s.   Maybe something weird happens and we give him a mulligan year, but it's reasonable to say that in normal circumstances, he's coaching for his job this year.
that's practically a war crime under the Geneva Convention
I mean IDK why a player going from the Lions(5-11) to the Jags(1-15) would expect much difference in quality...
But I’ve already been a member for 30 years.
Matt Patricia is ~~not~~ a big ~~fan of fruit~~ fat meanie.
Or slouching at press conferences
He's a big fan of fruit rollups though
MCDC works hard and likes to party. What's not to like?
All Catbro Conference Finals
As terrible as Patrica was, he at least knew who #99 for the Rams is
The biggest reason this regime feels different is the success they’ve had vs good teams. Caldwell’s Lions feasted on bad teams but went 4-23 against teams that finished the season with a winning record. Meanwhile in half the time and starting in a much worse situation Campbell is 6-11-1 against teams that finish with a winning record. Still a lot of room to improve but given their starting point it’s a massive improvement. They’re also 3-0 against teams that were 5+ games over .500 at the time they played, while every previous Lions coach going back to Jim Schwartz is a combined 0-22. Is that a wildly cherry picked stat? Absolutely. Is it indicative of a team that’s winning games that the Lions haven’t won this century? Also yes.
He's talking about Bailey Zappe
He’s a rookie every year until he wins a Lombardi. That’s the Patriot way.
And we still lost. Every game MJJ scores 4 touchdowns, his team loses. It’s an odd thing.
So... you're saying our strategy against you guys is to give up four tuddies to Marvin Jones? You got it!
I always thought the consensus amongst our fans was that he turned into Megatron twice a year against us
Idk if he's WR1 level.  Not having constant coverage by a CB1 or getting double covered is what opens him up to make those deep clutch catches.  When other teams know the game could only flip with a MJ deep catch he gets shut down.
Always made clutch catches when Trevor needed him.
Marvin basically went medieval on us whenever we played.  Straight-up, Thor hammered us.
I have a post 2009 big game pic with MJJ somewhere!
It’s okay. The shittiness really fits the Patricia theme

Word of advice: if you're on mobile and you're using single line spacing, hit space twice before entering a new line.
One of Zimmer's most based quotes.
Very authoritarian dictatorship style. I remember there was a quote  from a player about playing for him was like being in Cuba lol.  He also encouraged his players to dive at other player's legs during victory formations (?) which was not popular in the locker room because they didn't want to intentionally injure the other team. I remember there were reports that Peyton cussed him out because he ordered it at the end their game. And I know Coughlin yelled at him postgame when he did it to the Giants.
Greg Schiano is a sack of shit. Other than his coaching style, he was also aware of the abuse being committed by Jerry Sandusky during his time at Penn State. Should not be in charge of any locker room.
I am fairly certain that means you win, especially since Dan got his 10th win last year and Urban Meyer is probably somewhere feeling up co-eds not winning football games.
The Chip Kelly reign is the same exact story as the Matt Patricia reign except Kelly actually won games. Kelly ruled like a dictator too and got rid of some of the eagles best players. I cant imagine how much we would hate Kelly if he went 4-12
As someone who consumes an alarming amount of ketchup, it confuses me and scares me every time I think about it
It’s fine now, they’ve made sure that they have more than enough Acrisure so every fan in attendance gets their fill.
Did they have baked beans and pickles though?
That's how confident we are!
Lions always does a practice game with another team before the pre season starts.
This is such a lame take that a portion of our fans have. Yes, the Detroit Lions were legally allowed to take that money back. That being said, it was a classless move that almost no other team would do to a future HOF player and it was indicative of the way Quinn and Patricia wanted to run the organization. I have no issue with Calvin saying it was disrespectful, because it was.
I can't wait to see Packers fans reactions when the Lions win that division.  RemindMe! 45 years
You don't understand how cursed the Lions are like is NFCN teams do. As far as I'm concerned, no one should expect the Lions to succeed until they've actually done it. I understand I'll probably at some point be wrong, but I will never expect them to accomplish anything until after they've accomplished anything
Yeah but they still need to like actually win the division or even make the playoffs before you start talking about them like this lmfao
Sure, but let's wait until they actually win the division once before we move to the next part.
The last time the Lions started a season with 1 win in the first half and then went on a big tear to finish just outside the playoffs, with a cast of young, talented players who'd been built up over the course of a couple of bad years and hitting on good draft picks, alongside a veteran QB who they'd acquired a couple years earlier who had just finally looked like he'd clicked for the franchise was, uh...2007.  In 2008, they famously went 0-16 and 2-30 over the next two years.  I think the Lions are doing a lot of the right things and making smart moves. But I'm not going to trust that success is coming until it's already here. I've been burned before.
Seems like a reasonable request before they actually become 'the villain'
Yeah, you get it by becoming his dealer.
Counter point: Jason Garrett
No. I’m talking about the moral victory and grit/we play hard maaaaaannnnnn stuff.
That was a well executed game plan but one game doesn’t warrant a hand waive of other bad decisions.
I mean you can be a bad coach but still be a decent boss in terms of interpersonal relationships. He basically went from bad asshole coach to bad asshole coach
I was part of the club before it was cool.
Matt Patricia is ~~not a~~ big ~~fan of fruit.~~
panthers need to get their shit together so we can make this happen
I just want a season where every Cat team beats the shit out of every Bird team they're scheduled against. Nature needs to heal.
Oh yeah Meyer was 100% worse, but both built a shitty culture
These lions also eliminated the packers in Lambeau, that counts for something. Unsure what exactly, but they beat a potential playoff caliber team in a higher stakes situation than any other regular season game
Oh yea, I completely blocked out the Trauma he gave us
First time he had 4 TDs in a game was with us when we beat the Jets 49-9. Only reason I remember immediately is because I was there lol
Every game? How many 4 td games does he have wtf?
damnit, i blocked that part out. Thanks.
Looking at PFR, he's done it twice: won with the Bengals, lost with y'all.  https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/J/JoneMa02/gamelog/
I'm just loving the idea of Marvin Jones making a catch and the DB just says "after you" while casually jogging behind.
Tate and him were 1A and 1B for a few years together.
He’s clutch for sure.
That TD catch against the ravens before the 2pt to win? That was something special, and kicked off the playoff run.
✏️
Do me a favor, just kinda sit up, just like, have a little respect for the comments section.
> He also encouraged his players to dive at other player's legs during victory formations  Oooh He's that guy? What a dirty thing to do. So unprofessional. I was pissed after I saw that.
Ohh that guy! I remember the Coughlin incident
If you dive at victory formation, that's a recipe for getting hit back, and other teams may take the initiative
Schiano has done enough to get some deserved shit but the Sandusky connection is unfounded at best. The only time his name was ever connected was in a single sentence of testimony where McQuery (who was testifying) said he had heard that Schiano had seen it happen once and told the Penn State DC years earlier. Then Clay Travis, being the shitbird he is, screamed from the mountaintops that Schiano covered up Sandusky’s crimes when Tennessee announced they were hiring him. There is zero other evidence from an entire court case or any other witness testimony that Schiano was aware of Sandusky’s abuse.
I suppose so. The bet was never confirmed though
I don't really have an opinion, just curious how it's disrespectful in your eyes? He signed a contract and then broke the contract. Because he's a future HoFer that shouldn't apply? Or does the backup kicker have this respect as well? I don't know the whole circumstance so sorry if I'm asking a dumb question.
Goddammit. You just made me snort laugh my dog awake
Don't jinx yourself
That season’s narrative is flipped around there my man. Lions started 6-2 looking awesome (capped by the Shaun Rogers pick 6), then proceeded to finish the season 1-7, leading perfectly into an 0-16 season. So there are zero comparisons to this team’s trajectory with the 2007 team’s
Second year head coach. Owned all of his mistakes and made obvious adjustments for the better. I think we are fine.
In the final 10 games can you call out any bad decisions? Or is your only example the Minnesota game early in the season
I don’t think any Lions fans are giving him a free pass for games where he made obvious mistakes. Those games being the first game against the Vikings and against the Patriots. He deserved lots of blame for those losses and he took them. I’m not sure what other games you’re referring to and you won’t answer that other person’s question about said games.   The only other games from last year where you could even try to make an argument about questionable decisions is the Dolphins and Bills games. But even then, it’s a stretch.   Like, Andy Reid went years, over a decade of being horrible with clock management. Why is it a shock to you that a rookie head coach/second year head coach made questionable decisions a handful of times?
It’s a fair criticism but I think he did improve that aspect down the stretch.
I feel like as bad as Patricia was, it's in insult to compare him to Urban Meyer.
Shit man, we’re one of two teams ever to not win a single game in a 16 game season. I’ve never cried when my teams lose but fuck, not winning a game is rough.
They are headed in the right direction, might have another down year coming but hopefully they don’t pick a the qb who so be a bust
As a fan of a team with two bird teams in the division, I support this project
Nah I’m good, we don’t need this
That Patriots/bye/Cowboys stretch was not fun at all
How could you forget about Bailey “Tom Brady” Zappe
I was at that game 🫠
Looking at PFR, he's done it twice: won with the Bengals, lost with the Lions. OP is mistaken or I can't read, both equally possible.  https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/J/JoneMa02/gamelog/
“Right this way, sir”
that fucking pencil needs 🔥
He thinks that rather than enabling the Lions to spend that money on other players that were actually playing in games for us we should have given it to Megatron who quit mid-contract and wanted to get paid anyway.  Cap dollars roll over, so its not like if we didn't spend it it just stays in the owners pockets - it just gets used on different players at a later date.   Super disrespectful, right?
I think that phrasing Calvin retiring as breaking a contract is disingenuous. Everyone who watched his last season saw he was clearly was hurt and limping on the sidelines. To your question, yes a first ballot hall of famer who spent his entire career in Detroit should be treated differently than a backup kicker who is on the practice squad. It was disrespectful because they had already paid it and instead of saying "congratulations on a great career and enjoy retirement" they made him pay it back. It was 500k too which if I remember correctly we didn't even spend in free agency, so it's like like we spent it on some quality free agent like the person that responded to you implied. The only reason I can think that we did it was some power trip of Quinntrica to prove that they're the alpha dogs and every player can be cut/traded/or forced to pay back a bonus.     From a business perspective it's also one of the biggest boneheaded moves I've ever seen. Other players pay attention to stuff like this. They saw how we treated one of our greatest players of all time, why would they want to play for us when there are 31 other teams. We couldn't attract quality free agents and had to overpay for the ones we did. There's a reason why former players and quality vets are taking team friendly deals and talking about how good the culture is. Plus you add in the fact that Barry is at games and events all the time. The Lions advertise that Barry's going to be at an event all the time and more fans will come and pay more money because he is beloved. Look at opening day yesterday. If I was running the Lions I would have leaked to the Free Press so they ran a story about how we *could* have taken the money back, but didn't because of what he meant to the organization. That's fantastic PR for fans, Calvin, and potential free agents.    The people that complain about a "poor millionaire" losing 500k are ignoring that not only would they be pissed if it happened to them, but that 500k is coming from billionaires who inherited all their money. At least Calvin put in the work to be elite and sacrificed his body for that money.   Edit: it was 1 million not 500k, but my point is still the same. That's nothing compared to what it cost in bad PR
It's not jinxing if you've committed to eventually being wrong and then after several years you're finally wrong, which is what would happen if the Lions were good this year
Lol dude that is not at all where I was going with that
> In the final 10 games can you call out any bad decisions?  ...the Panthers game? The one where they got absolutely *bodied* by a team running a college offense with Sam Darnold under center?
If you think I’m talking about a single game then I’d suggest you go back and watch his press conferences from weeks 1-7 minus the Washington game and then the Panthers game. If you want to go back to 2021 there’s a lot of them as well. Take it up with the man himself if you disagree.  I like how you edited your original comment to add the 8-2 run part so it doesn’t seem like you moved the goalposts.  Edit: Not 8-3, 8-2.
It's like saying a sloppy fractured asshole is preferable to a geriatric diseased asshole. Maybe it's true, but it really doesn't matter because both are irredeemable assholes.
Nahhh, unless any other team in the NFC South somehow blows it out of the water which I highly doubt they do, Panthers will easily win that division.
I wholeheartedly support cat bros beating bird teams
What you didn't enjoy having Hockenson as WR1 and Tom Kennedy as WR2 because everyone else was out hurt or out on the field running on half a leg?
Don't put words in my mouth bro. What player did we sign for 500k that year? What great free agent did we use that 500k on the next year?   I'd bet you were one of those fans who licked Quinntricias boots for years and now pretend like you always hated them. 500k is cheap compared to the bad PR we got from it and what we had to overpay for free agents because of the assholes who went on a power trip.   Edit: it was 1 million not 500k, but my point is still the same. That's nothing compared to what it cost in bad PR
Im sorry but you already said it. Its too late. The Bears are now jinxed and the Lions are taking the division.
Getting blown out the second you step onto the field was not my interpretation of whats being discussed. Bone head in game decisions, particularly in the final moments was my reference point. Such as the Minnesota game we all complain about and what he specifically called out on himself
Bingo! They got ran all over and the coaches did nothing but were all out of ideas. I mentioned the Panthers by name but OP can’t read.
do you have examples from the final 10 games or not? If not, then its safe to say he’s gotten better and improved on game management that everyone knows he needed to work on. Not sure why you’re being defensive.
It was $1.6 million, but the dude is worth $45 million.  It has nothing to do with Quinn being bad at building the team, which he was - it's about Calvin acting immaturely.  He probably could have asked the team if they would pay him if he chose to retire and would have been armed with that information when making his decision, instead he assumed he would get paid for seasons he wasn't playing in.  Nobody begrudges him retiring, he gave up a lot physically to play, but so does everyone else that plays every week and many of them make a tiny fraction of what he was paid.  He (or more likely his agent) agreed to his contract and knew the details of it - he has never claimed the team reneged on anything they had previously agreed to, only Calvin did.
And why didn't they take the division when I said the exact same thing last year? This like that part in Avatar the Last Airbender where they guy wears the same pair of shoes every day because the fortune teller says he would meet his wife on a day he wore those shoes, and then Sokka pointed out that obviously if you are always wearing the same pair of shoes every day you would be wearing that pair of shoes when you met your future wife. It's not a jinx if I'm eventually wrong after years of sticking to my guns
If the Lions come out flat next year and he gets fired, people will point to that game the same way they do to the Bengals game with a chance to get into the playoffs from Caldwell's last year with the team.
Im not being defensive. If you actually read my comment you would find the answer you seek. I will not be responding anymore. Take care.
Because I'm just joking and I don't actually believe that your comment will have any impact on the outcome of history.  That said, I loved the Avatar reference.
So the answer is you don’t have recent examples and he got better within the season with game management. Glad we agree
“Executive says player he drafted is going to be good.”
Looking up "big stud Tampa" for research purposes to see how Rachaad White will do down there.
Are they playing us 16 times?
He didn't have too many games where he could get in any sort of rhythm due to split carries and our entire offense wasn't anywhere in sync in most games last season. I'm excited to see how he does this season without Lenny there.
I don't want to over react but I'm pretty sure he's the next Barry Sanders
Licht has had a lot of hits but he’s always struggled to draft quality RB’s. White had some big plays as a rookie but I didn’t see anything from him that made me believe he was feature back material. I’m usually hesitant to pick a RB in round 1, but if Robinson is there when we pick, hard to say no.
Speaking facts. Forks up!
The guy I hired to be my part-time accounts payable clerk is going to be a stud too. I just know it.
Heard this before lol  https://twitter.com/AroundTheNFL/status/1248598783190945792
Was he supposed to say he thought he’d just be alright?
“Nah jk I’m gonna cut his ass as soon as the draft is over.”
Said this last year
I have more antipathy toward the sports media creatures who report this than I do toward the execs.
Just once I'd like a GM to look at a guy he drafted and go  "...I should really quit drinking"
Coach/GM/Players on their team speak is funny. I played dynasty fantasy football and I have a buddy always sending me shit like this and I'm like "WTF else are they supposed to say there. He sucks?"
Just pictures of Doug Martin
He looked great vs Seattle with Lenny out
Its going to be funny seeing what the deal with RB interest is this year. Some years teams are fighting and clawing to trade up and steal them first. Other years they don't budge and at some point in the second round a great player just falls into some teams lap.  Honestly I think the bucs should invest in their defense this year and see how things play out at the QB position around the league this year. They are in a good place to revisit the "Brady" method again in a year or two -- build a complete roster and then plug in that last hole to make a run.
Didnt the o line basically explode over the course of the year though....
It's really easy to say "no".  Super easy, barely an inconvenience.  Who's the last first round RB that everybody would agree was worth it?  McCaffery?  Back in 2017?
we have too many other pressing needs at 19 to draft Bijan even if he fell to us  LT or an edge rusher has to be the pick
Lol he was playing behind the worst offensive line in the past decade, under a braindead coach.  I saw a guy who looks like he can be a top 5 running back. He has the size, speed, receiving and rushing ability.  He's a bigger faster Alvin kamara.  But you guys still have the braindead coach.
Feels like fanbases from over half the teams in the league are saying that about Bijan
Yeah RoJo was a better runner despite the fact that White is better at everything else.
Dijon is an exception
I posted a mock recently in the draft sub with that pick and Tampa fans in there did not like it whatsoever…but I think it’s a fit tbh  Let Trask or baker lean on him and then if you’re getting a rookie like Williams or maye (if Tampa is bad) then you have an established run game to lean on for a rookie too
Agreed on that last point. I’m not ready for the team to suck again, and a stud rookie RB would arguably be the best immediate boost to the roster at 19.
Picking Robinson over one of the top offensive tackles is available would be a travesty. Luckily I think Licht has learned after drafting OJ Howard there is a reason you don't pick certain positions in the 1st.
Admitting you are in management on Reddit? GASP!  You know you're getting downvotes you monster.
Oh wow, the year where he  *checks notes*  Was 20 yards off from a 1k season while splitting carries with Leonard Fournette for the second half of the season and then won a super bowl?  Ok...
100%. Someone probably asked him the question and what is he supposed to do?
We call that a keim time special here in az. Hide ya linebackers
And pics of some recently divorced 45 year old guy for some reason.
You could see he has good vision and waits for the play to develop which is so refreshing when Lenny would just run to where the hole was supposed to be and more often than not run into his linemen.
I’ll believe the RB market is truly changed if he goes anywhere after like 15-20, he’s the latest “generational” talent since Saquon, but this is also a deep draft and a lot of veteran pieces have moved this off-season so I’m curious about how that shifts RBs this year
Lost our starting C and OG before the season opener. Our LT had a harder time mentally than Brady last season and our 2nd round OG shit the bed. By the end of the season it was Wirfs and some future insurance agents.
And while McCaffery is amazing and arguably the best RB in the league, the Panthers were 34-53 while he was on the team. Alvin Kamara was drafted in the 3rd that year and has more yards and touchdowns in the same time span (due to CMC being injured.) I'd argue that pick could have been better spent elsewhere.
Right. Even for how dog shit our run game was last year, I wouldn't draft a back considering we don't have a left tackle at the moment. Running back is like fifth or sixth on needs as far as I'm concerned.
But we have less braindead coaches since Leftwich is gone!
I love White but he's not Kamara.
I feel like he could end up being a surprise top ten pick.
Better than regular mustard except for hot dogs
Yeah bc we need a LT. We're not going to do anything without one. Plus Charbonnet can be had in the 2nd round and is a freakish prospect.
OJ Howard was the right pick when it happened. It didn’t work out, but he’s easily one of the best TE *prospects* ever. Emphasis on prospect.
Truly the worst case scenario is that no one ponies up a high pick for him and he lands in the Chiefs hands. Because they are good enough to afford to take anyone.  Kc fans if you're reading this - its a compliment.
I thought Hainsey stepped up and did a good job at Center. Be interesting to see if he wins the LG role this season or just stays as a backup awa precaution.
Could always be spent better elsewhere.  Better question--when's the last time a team won a Super Bowl when they had an RB on the roster they drafted in the first round, where you'd say that player was actually a big part of the team?  Edwards-Helaire was the last pick of the first round for the Chiefs, nobody would say he was worth it.  Sony Michel in 2018 was at least good, but I don't think anyone would bang the drum for him.  Do we have to go all the way back to Emmitt and 1995 to find an RB where you can say "this dude carried his team to a ring"?
I know. He's kamara if kamara were bigger and faster.  He can be better than kamara.  What you fail to realize is that you guys had the worst offensive line in the history of football. You also fail to understand the effect that has on a RB
Within the mock I’m referring to tampa got Anton Harrison in round 2.   And he was actually the next left tackle to go in the mock as the only tackle taken between bijan and him was Dawand Jones who’s a RT only
Only hope is they’re scarred by the CEH pick, but, if they had picked JT as RB1 like most projected, then they would be an even bigger issue these last few years
He was serviceable with what he had but he was having to help plug the sieve at LG and that didn't help. I'm confident he'd do well if Jensen moves on next year and we have competent RG & LG. If he's on his own though it will be a long year.  TBH, I'm with Licht. If we can shore up the OL and our scheme is better than last year we can have a good running game and that will take pressure off whoever our QB is and allow our weapons to work. I don't think we need the next Saquon and I don't think he'll upgrade the team that much especially if he's running behind a dogshit OL.
I think the closest to being "worth it" in recent memory might have been Gurley, but he obviously wasn't enough to actually get the Rams the ring. Smith probably was the most recent to actually do it.
Jamaal Lewis basically was the Ravens offense in 2000.
Look man, I like him too. But he's not going to be as good as prime Kamara, let alone better than.
No...he isn't. First off, Kamara is bigger than White. I've watched every snap of the Bucs for years so I'm well aware of our offensive line issues.
Idk if you wanna roll those dice. You'd need some big cajones.
Those are basically my thoughts too. Take best T in first, and try and pick up G on Day 3 to add depth and possible challenge for the start.  I would also be happy if they drafted Vorhees in the 5th. He was a projected 2nd rounder till the Combine injury. He would basically be a red shirt this season, but could be a steal after.
The fact that you can say that so assuredly tells me you're completely full of shit. So does the flair.
Rachaad White - 6' 215lbs.  Kamara - 5'10 215 lbs.  What glue is the best for inhaling in your expert opinion?
Lol if you look at my post history, and see who I say I would take at 1.01, you’d know I have that   /s
Ok Rachaad
If you make up numbers, you can have any opinion you want!
Lmao you're a clown. What are their sizes?
Good on Irsay. As random as this shit is to read, nice to see him stepping up.
Whether it’s good or bad Jim Irsay news is always a fun time
I love the idea of Jim Irsay, baked off his gourd, watching a whale documentary and immediately calling his accountant to tell him to pay whatever it takes to free willy.
Well that’s awful kind of Irsay to assist OP’s mom like that. What a guy.
It's a nice story but I immediately think: How's this orca gonna do in the ocean after being in jail for 50 years? Orca are very social.
fuck it, you help a tortured Orca, you get my support I hope you win a title.  Hopefully he can help the one that's stuck up north that we saw recently in an overhead shot from a drone
“She lived in the smallest orca enclosure in North America, in a pool of water that made her skin infected and was fed fish that was occasionally rotten and led to intestinal issues.”  Parents just take your kids somewhere else like the park or a movie.  Don’t pay for this shit to happen
Credit where credit is due. We shouldn’t have these animals in captivity
Free Willzyx!
Used to dislike Irsay, then I heard about his rock memorabilia collection, now this.  Starting to realize I misjudged
Is there a single NFL owner with more chaotic energy than Jim Irsay? When I see his name in a headline I don't know if it's gonna be good or bad but I know I'm in for a wild ride.
“BuT hE dId PiLlS aNd HaD a MiStReSs!!!”  The man has his problems, but people shit on him when he does anything right. He has championed a lot of causes, and may be the catalyst behind getting Snyder out the door.  He has always been good for the sport, and it will be a shame when he passes away.
>Experts worry that if she were to encounter her kin, even through a sea pen, the infections Toki picked up in captivity could be spread to other southern resident killer whales, an already-endangered group that numbers only 74 individuals.  So uh, what are they gonna do about it
A “generous contribution” from Dan Snyder helped alleviate the financial questions around a crew of Japanese Whalers, currently planning a voyage to hunt Tokitae, recently freed after 50 years in captivity.
Good on Irsay, but fuck Tokitae’s kidnappers for keeping her in solitary confinement for 50 years and letting her out only when it made financial sense. Hate seeing this story passed around like it’s supposed to make us feel good.
Jim does some of the coolest, weirdest shit and I love the man
Irsay really represents the Yin and Yang of cocaine. On the one hand he's made the Colts a miserable franchise, but on the other he can donate money to a beautiful being such as Tokitae. Thank you cocaine!
Am I only the only one surprised it wasn’t the browns and their new qb trying to free Willy?
I could see the orca getting killed by a tougher wilder orca really fast. It sounds like a goofy family guy skit, but I don't know if this will turn out positive 🤷‍♂️
“Snortin’ rails and freein’ whales!”  — Jim Irsay
Can they survive in free waters once they've been in captivity for so long?
A lot of you know nothing about orcas (specifically the southern resident orcas), and it shows. Freeing Lolita is the right thing to do
Holy shit... An NFL owner in the news for doing something positive with their wealth?   I'm staying indoors away from anything conductive.
This is A. a good move by Irsay B. objectively hilarious in its randomness.
After 50 years in captivity that Orca is most definitely going to have a short run in the wild unfortunately. It’s wild we have animals that large in captivity in the first place.
This is a great pairing. The Irsay family is known for logistics.
Good on Jim, but this is likely just a publicity stunt as her tank conditions are horrible and the plan for release could take years. A preemptive PR piece to soften the blow prior to her dying in captivity. When the tank water is so bad that you wouldn’t swim in it yourself, things might not be okay.    https://i.imgur.com/AmT3ssK.jpg https://www.instagram.com/reel/CqrBM9yrTPP/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=

Pat Mcafee show clip about this was so funny
After 50 years in captivity that whale is probably gunna starve to death in the wild.
He was too late to save honey. [Honey has one of the saddest stories ever. ](https://savedolphins.eii.org/news/honey-the-dolphin-dies-alone-in-japan-park#:~:text=We%20have%20just%20learned%20that,several%20years%20until%20her%20death.)  Futurama sad
Imagine having to work for 50 years of your life before you're let free.
A "generous contribution" from Jim Irsay helped alleviate the financial questions around Kelvin Benjamin, the oldest orca in free agency, and his path to a roster spot after 5 years of practice squad. “I know he wants to get to free trainers' buffet”
NO! Don't release her into the wild! Look up what happened to Keiko (Willy from Free Willy), it did not end well. Give her a big ass tank but letting her go is a death sentence. (Grew up in Oregon, we followed Keiko's story closely)
After 50 years of captivity, I'm not sure how well it will do back in the wild. Orcas are very intelligent but that is a long time of being solely dependent on humans.
Just bear in mind the cautionary tale of Keiko, the orca that played Free Willy.  Keiko was freed in the early 2000s, and the press heralded it as a success story. In actuality, it was a complete disaster. The entire operation cost $20 million and was basically a wash from the word go. Keiko did not adapt to life in the wild at basically any point, captivity was all he'd known by that point. He never interacted with other whales other than a single brief encounter where he quickly sought out his human caretakers again. He'd follow them around constantly and being "walked" in a small boat 3 times a week and fed daily, for more than a full year. He died of pneumonia not long after he was freed.   The lead author of the study published by Marine Mammal Science said:  > "You can't just let these animals out into the wild. You have to take the responsibility, and that might cost a lot of money. The fortune spent on Keiko might have been better invested in conservation programs to protect whales and their habitat ... But that's not as appealing as the adventures of a single whale".  All that money and effort, and the whale was debatably no happier than it would have been if they'd spent a fraction of that money setting up a kind of sanctuary or enclosure (as many experts had suggested they do) instead of just chucking them back in the ocean and taking care of them exactly like you would end up doing anyway. I know it's tempting to want to free a single whale...it sucks that they are in captivity at all. But this whale has been in captivity for *50 years.* At a certain point it's just too late to fix mistakes like this. I feel like we need to accept that we fucked up in this whale's case and that we need to focus on making sure this doesn't happen again.
Irsay coming to from a cocaine binge Week 1 of the regular season: "I saved a what?"
Remember the last time radical, unqualified people tried to release a captive whale?  It died.
Doesn't captivity screw with ocean mammals ability to survive in the wild? I know it causes their dorsal fins to slump over, which you see in pretty much every orca in captivity
Wtf Irsay don’t try to make me like you
That orca is going to die within a year of being released. Uniquely unprepared for life that's not in captivity. Sad situation no matter what you do at this point.
That animal will probably die shortly after being released.   Zero hunting skills, thrown in a literal cesspool after being kept in near pristine conditions.  Yeah wonderful they're releasing it.
Man, how much coke does this guy do?
How about your rich fucking ass spend money to ensure a SAFE habitat for animals like this.   The problem these animals face isn't captivity, it's habitat loss and destruction.
Rare Irsay W
Tearing up a little bit over here
The redemption arc
Yes another orca to eat some dolphins. Thanks Irsay low key helping squish the fish.
Makes sense he would do this. After all, he once had a punter who was desperate to get into open water.
i read that quote in Cheech & Chong's voice
If you think this will make me forget about the past year of embarrassment of the Colts franchise you are absolutely right.
I fucking hate Jim Irsay
I believe that Jim believes that he has spoken to this orca.
I heard he took the money back when he heard the orca had a neck injury.
A billionaire with empathy? What the fuck am I witnessing here.
I love the idea of Jim Irsay all coked out saving whales. Truly a man after my own heart
How is this football related?  I got a post removed for posting stuff about Aaron Rodgers going into the dark room because it "wasn't football related". Hypocrite mods.
Nice I guess... But random Colts propaganda (maybe a poor way to put it) which has nothing to do with football other than trying to make Irsay seems like a good person
Jim Irsay. Cocaine. Whale tails.
This dude is trash. He dropped pfm to draft luck. Glad that worked out. Sell the team
"I love Blow and Blowholes" - Jim Irsay
Ain’t that the orca that’s killed like 4 of its trainers?
While there’s people serving sentences on marijuana charges.
free the whale
Isn't the Orca gonna die though for being in captivity so long?
Irsay and Jerry Jones are my favorite owners.
Based
Uhm how long could a whale that's been captive 50 years survive in the wild
50 years? Jfc. Had to look it up and apparently orcas live up to 90 years.. goddamn
The whale was told originally that it would be freed as soon as the Lions make it to a Super Bowl.
Seems like this should have been a slam dunk for the Dolphins ownership to pitch in…
W
Thank you based Jim
What an absolutely chaotic person
honestly if you hid the owners name and just say an unnamed nfl owner did this i bet like 80% of this sub would guess irsay lmfao
I bet the Rams wouldn’t have done this
r/orphancrushingmachine
What in the PR
I can only wonder if it can re-assimilate in the wild after so many years in captivity.
Irsay is little the kid from Free Willy.
Indianapolis Orcas has a nice ring to it.
I want multiple follow ups. They should make a documentary to sell and cover some of the costs of all this. I would watch this on Netflix.
After seeing the old doc blackfish I applaud him
I agree with some others in saying that after so long in captivity I don't you're doing her any favors by releasing her at this point.
What’s Tokitae’s 40
Does the Orca have a chance of surviving in the wild? I read a lot of the article but I'm also high so I apologize if I missed this info. My first thought is that I hope the whale even knows how to live in the wild or will be accepted by other Orcas out there which feels like it wouldn't be that likely. Definitely awesome of Irsay and the groups that made it happen, I just hope it really has a happy ending
He's  gonna be the Jeffrey dahmer of the sea. With that upbringing? Yikes
50 years is probably too long. Wild orcas gonna eat him alive
Releasing a whale that's been held in captivity for fifty years is like when they released Brooks in Shawshank Redemption.
I guess we’re back to liking Irsay??
Very thoughtful   Just curious though, how adapt is a captive animal for 50 years at surviving in the wild? Anyone have information on similar scenarios with other animals?
Good guy Irsay
would she have a safe orca family to join to help her in the wild? i hope so
Jim is still a clown, but this is something nice to see.
Can it play QB?
Free the Commanders fans next!
If I had wealth like that that's the oddball shit I'd spend it on. Irsay seems to enjoy his wealth, not hoard it. He's apparently a big music guy and buys famous guitars and stuff like that because he can.
He does all the time. Dude is hella philanthropic.
It is pretty funny seeing Jim Irsay claim he can read the thoughts of a whale, but yeah this is definitely awesome.
I want to hate him because of how shit the team has been, but he’s been such a good human that I can’t. It’s cool to see someone who’s been that rich his whole life care and give aid to anyone and anything.
Never thought i’d complement the guy but good for him
I know Irsay is sober now, but i feel like he just got really high one day and was like this isnt right, im going to do something about this.
Mr. Benefits Cetaceans
He seems like the John McAfee of the NFL. A shit ton of money, says a bunch of crazy shit, and is always doing something weird
I've been racking my brain trying t come up with a Free Willy joke, especially since we ARE talking about the always kooky Irsay, but I'll just let this stay wholesome.
This is like praising me for giving the guy at 7/11 asking for change a dime
For all his issues, he seems like an overall fine guy
For the weird shit he says overall he seems like he cares. Whether its colts personnel, the community, rock and roll relics etc.   He is a good man that has had his share of troubles.
If billionaire tyrants are going to own our sport franchises, the least they can do is be really fucking weird lol
This is like Mr Burns hiring that dog as his VP after watching it on a news report
Orcas are not whales, Jim
He’s clean and has been for years. He donates his time, money, and resources to helping others with that and mental health
To be honest if you watched Blackfish and had the money, you'd probably do the same
I refuse to believe it happened any other way
I’m imagining he did a line of coke, hit a blunt, turned around to his accountant and said “alright **brother** here’s my plan to save some motherfucking whales” (in my head Irsay has Hulk Hogans voice)
That very well may be entirely accurate as well.
"I know she wants to get to free waters"
He watched Blackfish and immediately sprung into action lol
Even funnier? This is the latest update on the non-profit advocating for her release:  > APRIL 1, 2023 UPDATE:  > Several mainstream media outlets are reporting that The Miami Seaquarium is partnering with Jim Irsay, owner of the NFL football team, the Indianapolis Colts, and the non-profit Friends of Lolita to send Lolita to a sea pen sanctuary and eventual release.   We do not have any further details or verification of this information other than what the media has reported
This made me laugh out loud. Thank you.
Orcas are beautiful with great big souls, just like me ma ❤️
They're releasing her in the same area her mother and pod live in. It's been tested and tentatively decided that her mother still recognizes the sound of Tokitae's... "voice"
Its a long and difficult process but its been done before. The whale from Free Willy is the most famous example. Here's a New Yorker article from 2003 explaining the trials and tribulations of freeing "Willy" (his name was Keiko):   https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2002/09/23/wheres-willy
They typically don’t just throw them out into the wilderness when they “release” animals in to the wild, this orca for instance will be moved to a sanctuary style setting that is still technically enclosed too in the first stages. They’re even going to be providing the orca it’s food until it relearns to hunt or on the flip side will continue to provide it with food if it never learns  Any initiative calling for zoo animals or captive ones in general to be immediately released usually don’t consider that it has to happen in stages like this to work, otherwise they become another example of that good will leading to the animal immediately dying upon release
gonna end up like brooks from shawshank  that whale was institutionalized. those seaworld walls are funny.
>Orca are very social.  She's going to tell the other Orca's what human did to her.
I think I watched a show on this stuff too, probably will be hard for it to adapt
Ya, I guess still better to free & let it have a shot.  But per [this article](https://apnews.com/article/lolita-tokitae-free-willy-orca-killer-whale-19bf64fc234e0fe15a46c9a79a346738) they've found this particular orca's pod she was taken from 50 years ago, and her mother is still alive and leading it.  Another article I read but can't find now mentioned they've broadcasted their calls to the other and both show signs of recognizing each other.  I'm no whale therapist so dunno the details there.  So of all the Orca's to try to rehabilitate it seems like this one has the best shot.
Good question! They will set up a "natural" pen in her native waters to slowly reintroduce her to the environment and actually teach her how to hunt. Her family still lives here, and her mom is still alive, so they will likely come and get her when she is fully released. They hunt and live as a group, so they will help her acclimate after her stint in the pen is done.
It's fucked most likely. Lose-lose situation. Sad.
Yeah it's not gonna be able to communicate with other pods but apparently the plan is to maintain a connection/assistance to the orca as needed. Basically she's really old anyway they're just letting her stretch her legs in the vast ocean instead of a cramped...bay or tank or whatever.   She probably won't stray too far from the support though.
I didn't want to be that guy either, but yeah, what chance does this have of working out?   Also, apparently this whale could infect others it meets up with due to the various infections it's picked up in captivity.   > Experts worry that if she were to encounter her kin, even through a sea pen, the infections Toki picked up in captivity could be spread to other southern resident killer whales, an already-endangered group that numbers only 74 individuals.
Could've swore that I've read multiple articles that they don't do well. Think more than one intentionally beached themselves.
https://youtu.be/jeMux1GjA7Y
That was so fucking sad
that one passed away a month ago (Kiska)
They're supposed to swim like 20k miles a year and we house them in the equivalent of a fuckin' bathtub. I'd turn into a serial killer too with that kind of life.
They’re typically rehabbing the animals. We don’t go and just fish for whales to put in cages as far as I know.
*Fuck you, dolphin!*
Irsay is probably one of the better owners in the league these days from a non football perspective. He's not perfect, but you can tell the guy cares about making a difference with his money.
He’s done some great stuff and he’s done some terrible stuff. Like most people. If I had to pick an nfl owner to hang out with for a day it would definitely be Irsay
I’m not a big fan of him because of the deflategate scandal but honestly other than that, he’s not a bad guy or owner it seems. He just wants to win which is more that other owners can say.
He does a ton for people in Indy too. Plus he genuinely loves his team and the fans. I wouldn't want any other owner in the league.
Even a good person by billionaire standards is still a bad person
Irsay really involving himself in the things that matter   “Jim visited sea world and was in the bathroom for a *long, looooong time.*”
Thankfully orca poaching has been drastically cut down in that same 50 year time span. But I agree that these "aquariums" are absolute fucking dogs.
It's already a tragedy. Trying to free the whale and help her acclimate to life in the wild is the best we can do at this point.
He's still miles better than his father. Robert Irsay was as bad as Snyder. Jim at least seems like he has a good heart. He's just an idiot.
>	On the one hand he’s made the Colts a miserable franchise  I can’t really blame him for everything that’s happened since Luck retired. Let’s not forget Luck aggravated his shoulder in a snowboarding accident he kept hush hush, so it wasn’t entirely the FO’s fault his body fell apart.   Ballard being too afraid to take a swing on a young QB, and listening to Reich about Wentz, has been our problem. And Ballard looked like a solid hire too.
We've had like 4 losing seasons since 2000, I'd take that over whatever the Falcons have been up to.
Rich coming from a 0 superbowl franchise. The colts are not miserable by any means. Falcons on the other hand....
Also being able to just "generously contribute" and free a whale is way better than most of us who get plastered and order something stupid off Amazon.
Cocaine is a hell of a drug.
Although I like to remind people that Jim Irsay is the man who adjusted for inflation extorted his municipality and state for more tax-payer money than any other NFL owner in the history of the league. No recent NFL stadium was more heavily subsidised than the Colts' with 86%.  Once you remind yourself of that you realize he is just spending the tax-payer's money to make himself look better.
I've never heard of them fighting amongst themselves, but when was the last time this thing had to hunt for its dinner?
Or...it impresses its potential predators with a series of tricks that leaves them mesmerized.
I came here to do coke and donate money to the most random news story of the week… and I’m all out of coke
Virtual guarantee he was high as balls when he did it so you're probably safe
The size is not as damning as orca intelligence and social structure. They're smart and highly social. You could put them in a tank the size of Jerry World and they'd still be miserable.
Dude Matt Patricia didn’t die when the lions fired him
read the article folks
You are downvoted but that's exactly what happened to the whale from free willy
What has Irsay done that makes him a bad person other than have the audacity to have addiction problems and be open about it?
You're absolutely right dude. I was reading articles on Orca and burst out laughing when I saw coked out Jim mentioned in this one. Its 100% PR but its amusing offseason content so I had to share.
What’s wrong with you?
4 trainers have been killed in *total* by orcas, so no. 3 of those trainers were killed by Tilikum (who the documentary Blackfish is about).  Even so, trainers being killed in captivity by an animal (especially one as intelligent as an orca) is the fault of the facility and the trainer, not of the animal’s.  Lmao downvoted by this dude within 10 seconds of replying
I don’t think he can fix that bro
He cant pay money to free people from jail.  Why arent you doing anything about the people in prison?
It's going to die anyway, might as well let it have some freedom.
Not long.
Do you have to talk about our women like that?
Orcas are whales, not hogs
Breaking: A “generous contribution” from Jim Irsay helped alleviate the financial questions around the Washington commanders, and her path to freedom after 24 years in captivity.  “I know she wants to get to free waters”
thank you kind Bills fan
I genuinely started thinking this was about us when I started reading the push notification I got. Irsay save us!!!
Commanders fans are free to root for a different team.
Now I’m curious. Can one person own more than one team?
Pretty sure he has the biggest collection of significant music memorabilia after the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. There's probably quite a few items he owns that they wish were in their museum. https://www.jimirsaycollection.com/
He also doesn’t hoard the guitars in locked vaults somewhere; he routinely will allow the collection to be seen by the public as well as put on his shows and allow the musicians to perform with them. Which is pretty damn cool of him to do.
the oddball shit I'd spend it on would be long snappers and punters but to each their own I guess
He shares that music collection for free by touring around as well
I’d be freeing orcas on the daily
/r/indianapolis will still shit on him for not doing more though.  He gave like 3M to the zoo a few months back and people in that sub were acting like he personally kicked their dog.
Seems like a really good guy who just happens to be beyond eccentric in his personal life
A buddy of mine used to caddy at a golf course he frequented (Crooked Stick). He would tip $200 for 9 holes and always buy him food/drinks/whatever he wanted at the club.
He’s a billionaire. All of them do these things. It’s incredibly easy positive press
Personally I am not surprised at all that Irsay thinks he can communicate telepathically with marine animals
Honestly anyone who looks at an orca in captivity and goes 'hey man that dude doesn't want to be here' can claim they 100% read that animals thoughts because they're just obviously correct lmao.
Must've done a few lines in the aquarium bathroom before he saw her.
Give anyone 2 lines of pure columbian white, and they can have a philosophical discussion with any mammals and sometime plants
Pretty sure he hasn't had people killed though
I don't think a dime would be enough to get a whale out of captivity
This is and always will be a logical fallacy
whatd you do?
I bet the whale appreciates that small (actually gigantic) action a hell of a lot  50 years in a white, featureless cell for nothing, whales are crazy social creatures
Probably cause Jimmy just inherited all of this shit. He's not the sleazy businessman who made it all possible, he's just living off the dividends and giving a ton of it away in the process.   Jimmy is a nepo-baby who has spent his entire life at the Colts facility and cares about nothing more in the world. I know Jim is laughed at often, but man does it feels great having the only owner in the league who treat his team as his full-time job. It's always weird reading articles about owners like Dan Snyder who view their team as more of a passive investment than a competitive sports franchise.
I knew a guy who worked on a boat Jim chartered once. Said he was a pretty normal charterer but just slightly strange. Said all he really wanted to do all day long was jet ski in circles around the boat while smoking cigs. Occasionally he would come back for a cocktail only to return to driving circles around the boat and smoking.
If it wasn't for that dog, Frank Grimes might still be alive today.   > [During his long recuperation, he taught himself to hear and feel pain again.](https://youtu.be/Rtr02bwgnqA)
It's more like Hullabalooza when somebody ordered the London Symphony Orchestra. Possibly while high.
I know this goes against most Simpsons' fans but I absolutely despise that episode. I feel like Grimes breaks the 4th wall in a way that you can't come back from and it destroyed the magic of the show. Once the magician reveals the trick he can't do it again....and they've been doing it for another 25 years.  It's a far far worse episode for me than The Principal and the Pauper.
Don't all Dolphins pretty much fall under the whale category?
1. Toothed Whale belonging to the Dolphin Fam. Family-Genus-Species. 2. Orcas released from decades of captivity face a "free life expectancy" of 1-3 years.  I love Jim for doing this. It will be a traumatic trip and transition for Tokitae. Most likely we are seeing an Orca who will not acclimate to the wild or find a pod to join. Most likely this Orca will die, but at least die free in nature instead of a tank.  It is horrible that SeaWorld did this to so many intelligent creatures for so many years.  Now, let's teach everyone about how intelligent squid and octopus are. Stop frying and eating them!
Dolphins are just a subspecies of whale with a singular blowhole and teeth.
They are actually both a whale and a dolphin.
They are not the hell your whales.
It's not a porpoose!!!
ehhhhhhhhhhhhhh i dont know jeeeeeeeeeem
Oh cmon, that doesn't fit the reddit narrative!
Luv me ma  Luv me whales  Luv me Jim Irsay  Simple as
Need to get me a pair of dem shoes
And they’re capable of growing to immense weights and ages as well!
*holes
Big mothers. Big whales. Big fun.
>	It’s been tested and tentatively decided that her mother still recognizes the sound of Tokitae’s… “voice”  This makes everything so much more sad given how long Tokitae has been away from her mother.
She'll also be in a large holding pen until she can get acclimated and relearn how to survive in the wild.
is it the same area that has whales such as your mother?
Keiko is a perfect example of this *not* working.
Except he died shortly after being released.
Well that just ruined my day
Willy died within about 2 years.
Thanks. Hopefully it all works out as intended.
>They’re even going to be providing the orca it’s food until it relearns to hunt or on the flip side will continue to provide it with food if it never learns  Relearning may be difficult since she's technically a southern resident orca.  They're the ones that only eat fish, ideally Chinook salmon, and have been struggling because of it.  If she manages to reintegrate with her original pod (L-Pod), that may help.
I saw a fishing boat once when I was a calf, but now...they're everywhere.
When the mecha orcas rise up from the seas to retaliate against the cruelty of humankind, Irsay will be spared.
There are a couple factors:  Her mother is still alive and recognizes her voice. Her siblings are still alive too. That should make reintegration possible  There's going to be a 18 month period where she's retrained to hunt, survive, and, presumably, drop any diseases or infections
> Kiska  this might be the start of my villian origin story.
<1,000 sq/ft apartment. Worn chair in front of gaming console>
I mean orcas in the wild aren't exactly tame. But yeah there's no reason to keep them (or many animals) in captivity.
Humans have the same condition, we just think we're free compared to the orcas
They did when most of these orcas were captured. Zero consideration about the implications.
On the other hand, seems there are a lot of marine biologists and the like who were inspired to pursue that path by seeing the Orca shows as a kid. It's just too bad that so many of the people in charge of them turned out to be such POS's.
I think Robert Irsay has Snyder beat in all honesty. Stealing the team in the middle of the night, trading Elway in the middle of the night without telling the GM (because Elway wisely refused to play for the Colts under any circumstance), and also being an alcoholic and abusive tyrant who's impulsive behaviour led him to fire just about anyone after every loss.
The best thing he did as owner was draft Peyton Manning, hire the GM that got the Bills to four Superbowls, and then kindly got out of the fucking way so those two could do their jobs.
You dont have Peyton or Luck anymore so I wouldn't get so comfortable
Any time your owner makes headlines people say this stuff. People shit on Jerry Jones and a lot of it is warranted but a lot of it is also completely stupid.
Give us 12 years with prime Peyton and we'd walk away with more than one Superbowl and we sure as shit wouldn't have committed the worst crime of the century and let the Saints win
Apparently Tokitae is a hell of a drug
Well obviously he's a piece of shit (he's an owner after all), but the use of powerful narcotics can lead to good as well as evil
Sounds like a good family guy skit. The orca scared to go back to the wild, then ends up doing a flip and they all celebrate like it's Rudolph.
Lmao well done
You're a fake colts fan. Please take that flair out. No real Colts fan backs up Irsay. Dudes a pill addict. He released peyton manning after he put the colts on the map. You take pfm out and the colts are the worst franchise in nfl history.  Change ownership. He's got you puppets washed. Lol what's wrong with you.  Lolol
Free Willy 5 x Wild Hogs 2 crossover movie???
There's going to be some asshole that comes in here and says they're not whales they're dolphins. When in fact dolphins are "toothed" whales.
They're infamous jerks like hogs are
They're actually dolphins, not whales.  They eat fish
They're both ungulates (though I can't recall if Cetacea are even toed or odd toed)
BREAKING: New Washington owner Jim Irsay has rebranded the team the "Washington Willies."  DC country, let's dive
I've tried, honestly (see flair). I'm 42, so that comes out to ... 42 years of being a Washington fan (I was born into the fandom). I like the players too much, and realize they aren't to blame for Snyder being such a piece of shit human being. And to be honest, switching to another shitty team isn't super attractive, but liking an already hood team feels like being a bandwagon fan.  Plus, fuck the rest of the NFC East.
Some fans actually stay through adversity
not just music, but a significant collection of history too.  The nice thing about the Collection is Jim is very good at sharing with the public.  He just did a tour with a lot of cool stuff around the country.      Many other private collectors hoard items and the public never sees them again
He also lends them out to bands to go on tour with, too. The pieces aren't sitting around collecting dust, they're continuing to be enjoyed by music fans around the world. That's a respect for the art that the dragon hoarders of the billionaire class don't often show.
Music memorabilia is such a huge collectors area and it makes it all the crazier that Stevie Ray Vaughan’s “Lenny” is just on display in a guitar center here in Austin
If I remember right he has David Gilmour's Black Strat. It's one of the most iconic guitars in music history. Gilmour sold his entire collection to donate the money towards fighting global warming. It definitely belongs in a museum.
In that article it says he is hoping to start a museum with his collection soon…. So it will be in a museum?
In this scenario are you a team owner employing long snappers and punters or some just crazy rich guy taking them in to your home like stray dogs?
Nothing odd about that, special teams is practical
There is nothing the rulebook that says orcas cant be long snappers or punters
Belichick is beside himself. Driving around New York begging (thru texts) /u/spilled-Sauce’s family for address to his home.
Found Bill Bellichick's account
Yeah that sub along with r/indiana seemingly hates him but they hate almost everything. Most don’t even seem to be sports fans and hate him for the simple fact he’s loaded.
You could cure breast cancer entirely and people would still find a way to criticize you for not picking a more common cancer to cure or not curing all cancers. It's not just the indy subs about Irsay, it's the whole internet about anyone with money and resources any time they do something good.   Like yeah you paid for a kid's cancer treatment, but why didnt you pay for every kids cancer treatments instead?
That is definitely not unique to /r/indianapolis.  Every time there is a story of a rich person practicing philanthropy the comments are full of people outraged that they didn't give away everything.
r/Indianapolis is one of the worst subs on Reddit.  I love Indianapolis. I detest r/Indianapolis and everyone in it.
Nailed it. Jim goes out of his way all the time to do things for people and the community.    He just happens to be a weird dude with some demons in his past.
I'd argue that it's pretty damn tough to grow up that wealthy and not end up at least somewhat eccentric. Jim is definitely not within even that bell curve though.
Nah, he objectifies women in his role as a “community leader” and is a total assclown that drives drunk and pays for the philanthropy to loook good, whenever suggested by his yes people.  One of those arrogant shit heads that acts with impunity and thinks you can paper mache over a rotten soul with rice and gold leaf.
They do not all do these things, not like irsay. He’s easily one of the most philanthropic owners, not even counting his generous he is locally that isn’t accounted for.
It's in line with the way McAfee imitates him. "Brother this whale wants to feel the free waters of the earth"
The CIA actually tried this kind of. With LSD and Dolphins. The lady ended up Jerking off the dolphin
"Gracie is pregnant."
You think you can do these things but you *can't*, ~~Nemo~~ ~~Dory~~ Irsay!
Yeah you don’t need to be a fucking psychic to understand animals probably don’t enjoy animal rights abuses
Tbf my buddies can look at me and be like “this dude doesn’t want to be here”
Fuck man this is hilarious, laughed so hard I shit my pants, think about this all night?
Dime of coke? It could jump the barrier like free Willy
That it’s dumb to praise billionaires who hoard wealth for making small donations for good pr?
Jim is the right level of eccentric. From his smoking booth, to his guitar collection, to his freeing of willy, to him being passionate about mental health because his demons have been televised, just a great owner to have.
I will say that the Hunt family, both Lamar and his son Clark, are the same way as Irsay. Lamar inherited his (oil) money from his father, HL Hunt, and loved football so he applied to build a new team. NFL turned him down for an expansion franchise, then turned him down when he tried to purchase the Chicago Cardinals and then became owner of the Dallas Texans of the newly formed AFL.   Lamar grew up around the team (he was born 6 years later) and played soccer at SMU. He worked two years on Wall Street then returned to work for his dad. Now all he does is run the Chiefs, own FC Dallas (MLS) and sit on the board of the MLS.   Less quirky that Irsay for sure. But similar backstory.
How dare you insult packers owners like that
He's hardly the only owner like that. The Rooney's don't own any other businesses outside of the franchise
For better or worse, Jerry also treats his team as a full time job
Lmao, fuck yes, dudes rock.
I know the yacht leasing category of people are a bit different than the rest of us but drinking and jet skiing sounds like the most normal thing for a guy who lives hundreds of miles from the sea to want to do when they're on a boat in nice weather.
I completely disagree but respect that opinion, although isn't it more of a meta-reference than breaking the fourth wall? I'm not a literary critic so I may be using terms incorrectly, or maybe the former is a superset of the latter. Anyway, the writers are obviously relying on the audience knowing how ridiculous everyone and everything in Springfield is, so they can juxtapose Grimey against Springfield (well, the Simpson family and Homer's coworkers) but I feel like something has to be more "character directly addresses the audience" to be fourth wall breaking?  Either way, I feel like there's plenty of much more explicit (non-Treehouse of Horrors, i.e. canonical) meta-referencing in the Simpsons prior to Homer's Enemy and so it didn't do enough to "break" the magic of the show for me, especially because "actual human" Frank Grimes is just as ridiculous of a character, both in his comical backstory (["I live in a single room above a bowling alley and below another bowling alley"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axHoy0hnQy8)) but also in his over-the-top mental breakdown. Still, I can see how it might bother some people since it's an entire episode based around that type of tongue-in-cheek meta-referencing humor that quickly became annoying in later seasons.  The Principal and the Pauper, on the other hand, bothers me because I feel like it shows a certain lack of respect for their characters and the emotional core the Simpsons had. They're making canonical, "it was all a dream"-tier, subversive changes to main characters with very established and recognizable identities... just to set up a plot where the jokes based on the episode's premise are much less funny than their counterparts from Homer's Enemy (IMO).  On the other hand, it does have one of my favorite Ralph lines:  > [Principal Skinner is an old man who lives at the school.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSbkBq9y6WI)
They are referred to as "toothed whales" along with other porpoises, dolphins and the Sperm Whale. Whereas "baleen whales" are those with whalebone plates used to sieve their prey, such as the humpback or wright whales. Together they fall under the category of cetaceans.
Refer back to chapter 32 of Moby Dick "Cetology"
They are all just fish to me
Yes, dolphins are whales.
Only their linemen
All dolphins are whales, but not all whales are dolphins.
I put basically all the marine mammals under the same umbrella in my brain. I know what you’re saying. The walrus and seal gang hangs out under one side of the umbrella and whales and dolphins hang out on the other side.
Not sure how to feel here. Killer whale expected to live 1-3 years in wild. Killer whale lived 50 years in captivity.
Don't care how smart  You taste good and I don't have a relationship with your kind? I'll fry you in butter and eat you, bet.
>Most likely we are seeing an Orca who will not acclimate to the wild or find a pod to join. Most likely this Orca will die, but at least die free in nature instead of a tank.  So Keiko round 2.
Order - Family - Genus - Species.  Whales and dolphins are in the Order Cetacea.  They diverge at the Family level. Orca and Dolphins are in the same Family.
Now she just needs a new caravan.
Protection? From wot? Ze Texans?
Like dags?
This guy pays the troll toll
It's tragic, and it might fail, but it's better than letting her die in a tank. We can only attempt to right that wrong of her captivity. We can't undo it.
I don't know that much about Wales but would the mother even be alive after 50 years?
Hilarious. Got the whole crew laughing.
A 50 year old whale is undoubtedly better off staying in captivity, unfortunately
Yes tragically, but unlike Keiko (who was reintroduced into the wild), the goal is to create an oceanic sanctuary similar to whats been done for big cats and elephants on land.
From a disease
We just need Finding Dory to help
The rest of us deserve our fate.
I for one welcome our mecha orca overlords.
Is 1k sq/ft supposed to be small?… that’s bigger than my house…
Christ
That’s why they’re wild orcas
“ I mean orcas in the wild aren't exactly tame”   No shit… if they were tame, they wouldn’t be wild.
Pass that blunt my way man
I'm pretty sure I could hear you ripping a bong as I read this comment
You're going to get so laid in your sociology 101 class.
/r/iam14andthisisdeep
Won’t argue with your overall point, but just a minor point that people seem to miss about the move to Indy: Baltimore was on the cusp of attempting to take the team using eminent domain law, so moving in the middle of the night had some motivation to it. It was a messy business on both sides there at the end.
LOL that's just being a "bad" or questionable owner/manager in terms of the moves they make and they mood they do it in. There are lots of business owners like that who don't break HR laws or cross legal and social boundaries with their moves.   Snyder is widely regarded as being a shit *human being*.
>Stealing the team in the middle of the night      oh fuck off that’s not what happened
The best thing he's done as an owner is actively love his team and be heavily involved in bettering his community.
Still been to the playoffs more recently than the falcons lol wtf did the colts do to you?
You couldn't win a single one with Shanahan, prime Matt Ryan and a 25 point lead.
God I’m so dumb. I read that and had already forgotten about the orca and thought you were making a joke about tiktok.
Fuck off with the drug shit.
It always fascinates me that people can laugh at the exact same joke so many times.
What’s wrong with you?
The vast majority of Colts fans love Irsay.
By the transitive property of multiplication, I read that as "Free Wild Willy Hogs 10"
You’ve got to wonder if they do that on porpoise.
They are toothed whales as are other dolphins but they are dolphins. So you are right and so is whoever calls them dolphins.
I actually asked a marine zoologist specially in whales about this at an aquarium. They said calling them dolphins is more accurate. Whales, porpoises, and dolphins are all cetacea. And while you can technically call all Cetacea "whales", most biologists would say Orcas are dolphins in layman's terms and would use scientific names otherwise.
Whew... now I feel better. 'Course, that might not do any good; you see nobody's missing a porpoise. It's a dolphin that's been taken. The common harbor porpoise has an abrupt snout, pointed teeth and a triangular thoracic fin, while the bottlenose dolphin, or Tursiops truncatus, has an elongated beak, round cone shaped teeth and a serrated dorsal appendage. But I'm sure you already knew that. That's what turns me on about 'cha, your attention to detail.
Rain games are the Wet Willies
When I think about the amount of historically significant items that are being hoarded by some reptilian billionaire who never let's the light of day touch them, I get sad. Good on him for being open with his collection, he really doesn't owe it to anyone to do it but he does anyway
Yep, he does displays at Lucas Oil during the off season, one of my friends went and said it was awesome
The two don’t have to be mutually exclusive
They get the pool house.
He makes long snappers and punters his Robins
Id just hire all of the good punters and kickers to be my housekeeping staff, simply to keep them from playing football for my competitors.   Or maybe my team needs 29 kicking coaches to hang out with my kicker. Yes, Justin Tucker might not be worth $15M/year as a poolboy, but the Ravens have scored 0 points in the last 3 seasons since I stole him
All local subs suck for some reason. I dont get it.
Not a bad reason to hate somebody by any means
This was in full swing a few weeks back when that youtuber guy paid to have a bunch of peoples cataracts fixed.
Doesn't he just hand out $100 bills at games all the time?
What kind of demons? Like he did drugs? Because who cares what someone else puts in their body that doesn't make him a bad guy. He has always seemed like a pretty legit dude to me. I never really heard much other then he might have done drugs is that what you are talking about?
You could tell me this was a real sentence that Irsay has said and I would have believed you 100%
To be fair, the dolphin was a smooth talker.
 In my best Shatner impersonation:  I am sitting here.., depressingly wondering.., how many people reading the above comment.., were actually alive.., when that movie came out....
TBF it’s a relatively new understanding, a lot of peoples irsays age were taught that animals don’t have emotions and cant differentiate between being in the wild vs being in a cage.  I’m not even 30 and I remember being taught that humans were special because we were the only animals that have emotions, everything else just reacted based on instinct.  Idk what the science was at the time, but it was def a popular sentiment.
Nah just thought it was a funny comment. Other jokes about his cocaine use are upvoted in this comment section but reddit is really influenced by the first couple downvotes or upvotes. The same comments are simultaneously at the top and bottom of a lot of comment sections.
You're giving dimes of coke to beggars outside 7-11?
Yes because dipshits that complain about this don't even do the bare minimum themselves.
Maybe a hot take, but the only good billionaires are inherited sports team billionaires.
If one group is "toothed whales" and the other is "baleen whales," it sure seems reasonable to refer to the group combining them as "whales."
Queequeg, get my science volumes!
But they're mammals
Not judging you here - legit thinking out loud (in text): Would you rather live 70-80 years as a free man or over 1300 years in jail? Similar ratio.   I think I know which one I'd take.
Even that's a bit nebulous.  Bottlenose dolphins are more closely related to blue whales than they are to river dolphins, for example.  Really, they're pretty arbitrary categories.  It's mostly just "This group is small, so they're dolphins.  This group is big, so they're whales."
In periwinkle blue, no less.
Ya look loika boxah
D’ya laik dahgs??!
*angry Top Gear trio noises*
Dags? Whatre... Oh DOGS. Sure... I like dags!
Yes, Orcas in the wild can live up to 90 years. They know what pod she is from, and they still recognize her dialect (and she recognizes theirs). Orca pods are matrilineal with a matron mother often living together with many generations of her descendants.
I don't know much about the United Kingdom either, its okay, but what's that got to do with this Orca?
Her mother *is* alive, so yes?
I think her mother is like 98 and still alive
I think elephants can live a really long time. Big animals are rather robust.
The tank it’s in is incredibly small. The entire Miami Seaquarium is depressing as fuck. I’m sure injuries and health issues at zoos and aquariums are common but I’ve never seen so many filthy, cramped tanks. Lived in Miami for 12 years, went once, never went back.  Edit: recent article on how bad it is there:  https://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/miami-seaquarium-animal-abuse-lolita-usda-dolphin-company-13691594
Let me die free then in a cage imo.
I wish that we could create Ocean Sanctuaries in the same way that we create ones in Africa. Large swaths of land where the animals get to live wild and free, but are still in some form of protective captivity. Because as you said after 50 years even *IF* her pod takes her back, she's very likely going to have a hard time surviving and adapting back to the wild.   I have hope for her of course but I just wish there was a better way, something in-between wild and captivity, just so much harder to do for sea-life.
I didn't read the article but that's good to hear. A much more realistic solution than releasing an orca that's spent so much time in captivity back into the wild.
Tokitae’s mom (and pod) are alive and permanent residents of the puget sound. If tokitae can resocialize, their survival should be much higher than Keiko’s
So we're Truman Show-ing this whale?
well in that case hopefully it ends better. I have to admit that my first thought was also that this orca would be dead in a month after release.
Where do you store all of your bass guitars then?
There a plenty of tame wild animals. Tame doesn't always mean domesticated, it can also just describe their demeanor. Butterflys are tame animals.
You know there are two definitions of tame, right? It's not just a domesticated animal.
He can't he's busy swimming 55 miles a day.
Yeah he was attempting to prevent his team from being stolen.  Huge difference.
Correct. The city of Baltimore tried to take the team away from the psycho who singlehandedly destroyed it. They were right to do so.
You probably can't find a single nice thing said about Bob Irsay on the entire internet. but we're just comparing rotten apples to rotten oranges here
Hope you're as optimistic about your future as you are nostalgic about the past
Honestly I think we're both idiots for discussing whales on an NFL forum at 8am but I'm glad to be doing it with you.
What do you think Jim was doing for 45 minutes in Josh McDaniels' bathroom hmm?
The comedy understander has logged on
I’ve seen that movie! The willies and hogs are more free and wild than ever. Much better than Free Wild Willy Hogs 9.
Hog and whales are modes of transit after all
You better seal it up right now
It sounds like the Vatican is even worse, but we will never know for sure what they actually have.
Who comments on local news stories on Social Media? Probably similar people who frequent local subs.
The KC sub has actually become somewhat decent over the past few years. It used to be full of conservative suburbanites and other NIMBY dorks like every other local sub but they mostly seem pushed to the margins now.  Threads involving homelessness, crime, and/or transportation infrastructure still get a little dicey at times but it's mostly the sane people who get upvoted the most. It's at least not an embarrassment to the city anymore!  However the less said about the Missouri sub, the better. Haven't been to the KS sub but it's probably the same.
Well yeah I agree for sure but this is Reddit. 70% of this apps think wealth is evil lol
Yep, MrBeast got all kinds of shit for only paying for 1000 peoples' surgeries and for making a video out of it. What an asshole for treating that at no cost for so many people instead of just making a $1 vs $1000000 massage with happy ending parlor video or something else stupid
Yeah, he also does things on his Twitter where he'll ask random questions about Colts trivia and give out cash and prizes. My wife won $100 and a Colts hat a couple years ago and the $100 came in the form of an official team check signed by Irsay which I geeked out over.
Oh yeah he's always handing out money to people lol
Yup. Also holds Twitter contests all the time. I won a grand from one of his contests (he also donates another grand to the charity of your choosing) right in the heart of Covid when my employment was suddenly very unstable. Dudes a little wild but he’s awesome.
There was a situation of a woman (possibly mistress, I can't recall) overdosing in a townhouse that was either owned or provided by Irsay. This was around the time of his arrest and suspension years ago now.    Jim seems to have cleaned up his act but he isn't perfect by any means. I'm still glad he's our owner. He loves this team and he loves the community.
[I reckon this](https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/colts-owner-jim-irsay-arrested-charged-with-dwi-4-felony-counts/) event is what you’re probably looking for; which has had the result of him being memed a druggie owner by a lot of /r/nfl.    The sad thing that seems to constantly get missed (not accusing you of it, Frosty) about Irsay’s former opioid problem was that it came right after he had several back and hip surgeries following his days as a power lifter (dude was squatting 700lbs at one point before he took over the team)  The same situation that a whole lot of people go through that puts them on the path of opioid abuse, by that I mean it starts off as a routine medical habit that they sought out to get relief from real pain that turns into a substance problem.   Doesn’t make the choice to drive while intoxicated right, fair or correct. But it is an aspect of how he got to that point in his life that is frequently overlooked.   Good on Jim for beating it, [Great on Jim for helping others try to do the same ](https://www.indystar.com/story/news/health/2020/02/25/indianapolis-colts-owner-jim-irsay-gives-iu-health-treat-addictions/4867545002/)
I think his demons were just a substance abuse problem, and not like a run of the mill he likes to do drugs thing, like an actual addiction that he himself would have said was a problem. But yeah he's a philanthropic dude and doesnt seem to have any real evil stuff like many other owners of sports teams.
Doing substances is one thing. Abusing them is another.
Nah, you're just being a dick about a guy who has donated millions of dollars to research and shared his struggles publicly amidst masstive stigma.
You’re not?
Isn’t this in itself a logical fallacy? If we’re getting all Ben shapiro
Sooo.. orcas *are* whales? Did we make it 360° yet?
This is true. The same goes for seals and sea lions. What we call sea lions normally are actually known as eared seals, and seals are earless seals. In most cases, that is. There are exceptions, such as fur seals, which are actually eared seals (aka sea lions) not earless seals (aka seals). I much prefer the nomenclature of eared vs earless, because it is much more consistent, and if you call a sea lion a seal, you're still technically correct.   Same with toothed vs baleen whales. Orcas and sperm whales are whales, because all porpoises are toothed whales.
Depends on if you want to call dolphins tiny whales or if you prefer Orcas being big ol' chungus dolphins. Im personally cool with either of those
That's actually the only reason that pescatarians don't eat them
Yea, and a tomato is a fruit but it may as well be a vegetable
No need for comparison. 3 years free vs 50 in captivity sounds like a no brainer
True. And the classification system even changes.  Mostly dolphins are assholes. Orcas less so.
I was having a down day and this thread really turned it around for me, thanks guys 😂
Solid reasoning.
*believed* to be alive, but still yes
*than   Hate to be that dude, but it sounds like you wanna die twice
Let me die fed and comfortable rather than confused and starving
It's not often you get to witness a typo completely change the meaning of a comment first hand.
I'm not a whale biologist or anything but I feel like we could, especially with Orcas. They're smart enough to know that if they keep going to the same spot, a human will drop food there. So basically you just need to develop a relationship with them, give them food, then continue doing it on a schedule, and they'll probably keep coming back. Again I'm not a scientist but this method works on literally every other animal that I've ever personally encountered so why not Orcas
That's incredible the mom is still alive, and so tragic that they've been separated for so long. Whales are such complex and intelligent creatures; I can't imagine what their reunion would feel like for them.
I think keiko died from pneumonia. It is true he was not able to integrate into a pod but that’s not why he died. Immune system is most likely complete garbage after being in sterile captivity for its entire life
They’re hanging up on my walls! Only place I could fit them all because of my amps
Butterflies are not 5-ton beasts with sharp teeth big hoss
This would have established an incredibly dangerous slippery slope/precedent that the NFL would not in a million years have wanted to do for the sake of the owners and honestly the fans too. Robert Irsay was a massive POS but Baltimore tired to pull some BS.
I do have to cop to my ignorance of Bob Irsay, specifically, but what was being said about him didn't seem to rise to pimping out cheerleaders or a corporate culture of sexual harassment and defrauding the league :P
I mean we're probably at the lowest point the franchise has been at in 20 years and I still feel better about the colts than I do the falcons lol.  Again, wtf so you have against the colts?
Haha same, I’m glad to be doing it with you too.    If it makes you feel better, I’m actually doing it at 5 am my time too.    5 am NFL forum whale talk! Hit that like and subscribe button
Haha addiction is a hilarious disease!!1!
No you misread what I said, I'm implying I don't understand how they can do it.
The series jump the shark when The Rock joined in 6.
[Ironic.](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/031/213/ironic.jpg)
Yeah you cant be having people overdose with you lol. And a agree he's def an asset for the nfl.
That's a little dramatic. I praised him in another comment in this thread and think he's one of the better owners in the league. You can appreciate someone's contributions while also laughing at their past.
No, if you sit on your ass all day doing nothing but expect everyone else to do more that makes you a trash human and a parasite.
>Did we make it 360° yet?  Do you know why they call it the XBox 360? Cause when you see one you turn around 360 degrees and walk away.
They’re closer related to other dolphins than other whales and officially part of the dolphin family. I’d go with dolphin over whale
It's literally all semantics and linguistics. For example, there are many languages (and even other dialects of English I believe) that differentiate between bactrian and dromedary camels, to the point that they aren't generally considered to be the same animal. They will usually have their equivalent of "camel" for bactrians and a word similar to "dromedary" for the others. If you want an example outside of the animal kingdom, there are several languages that consider [blue and green to be shades of the same color](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue%E2%80%93green_distinction_in_language), while others like Russian and Polish differentiate shades of a color with different words (e.g., light blue and dark blue are considered different colors entirely).
Which is a shame because *they’re fucking delicious* and also orcas would not hesitate to eat you. Because *you’re fucking delicious*
Fruits and vegetables are arbitrary groupings based on varying guidelines.
Tomatoes are known as "Devil Fruit" in my house
Umm excuse me 1300 years living, while it might be in a jail. Means the odds of seeing the vikings win a superbowl go up at least 25%.
>Mostly dolphins are assholes. Orcas less so.  I've seen a couple videos of live seals getting tossed around by orcas for fun that may indicate they're are assholes.
No, he wants to die free first, *then* you can put him in a cage.  Coffins are just like...   cages to keep zombies in, anyway.
Lol
We are not the same
Imagine being in solitary confinement for 20 years.   I’d rather a bullet to the brain than that.
Well the thing is a whale isn't comfortable in a fish bowl.
>comfortable  Lmao
I know. I said orcas aren't tame. They are some of the most aggressive hunters in the animal kingdom. They also hunt for sport too.   The point I was making is that "tame" doesn't always just mean domesticated.
It could have brokered a situation where sports teams are owned by the cities/fans/community, rather than owned by some random family profiting off tax subsidies in perpetuity. Billionaire owners DO NOT have to exist.
There are bigger problems in the world than billionaires doing coke. Cry me a fucking river.
I know. I can read sarcasm. Can you?
At least he let his hog run hog wild
This is another logical fallacy though right? Like come on guys
> if you sit on your ass all day doing nothing but expect everyone else to do more  You just described the Utopia for 99% of Redditors.
Fuck we're old
if you turned 360 degrees you’d actually walk right into the Xbox
I'll pass on both, too chewy
I've been kinda spam posting in this whale/dolphin conversation, so I'll make this my last comment.  What would you consider sperm whales to be? Are they dolphins? They are toothed whales, and they and dolphins/porpoises/orcas are all more closely related to each other than to "true" (baleen) whales.
> and also orcas would not hesitate to eat you  They must hesitate a little considering there has never been a single recorded incident of an orca ever killing a person in the wild.  And if you've seen orcas, it isn't that they aren't capable of killing people.
My brother brought me back some whale sausage when he took a trip to Norway, I'm genuinely a little scared to try it lol
Well, fruits have a specific definition, but yes vegetables are completely arbitrary.
Not gonna lie when I open up notification to my original post and see this i know shit got weird
Touché
Lol, yeah we are.  You just tell a badass story about yourself, to yourself.
Oh, hardcore  I feel for the orca 100%, and I think it's fucked that we put them in captivity. Having said that, two wrongs don't make a right.  It can be wrong to keep an old animal, particularly an intelligent one, in captivity. But it can also be wrong to leave it in an environment where it doesn't have a social group and doesn't know how to fend for itself.
It's an animal. It does not ascribe value to "freedom". It does not understand the concept of things having "value" except in how it helps it live long enough to reproduce.
Like the education system in this country.  Laughing about addiction is dumb.
Going by your previous posts, I didn't realize you knew what sarcasm was.         Forgive me.
[git gud kid](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/265/714/fd1.gif)
Trolling is a art
How are toothed whales not whales?
Or maybe it’s because they don’t leave any witnesses to tell the tale.
It's human nature to strive to be free
I think this is a scenario where it's reasonable you and I have different opinions.
it does (potentially) have a social group waiting for it (including the mother)
Humans are animals too buddy. They are highly intelligent beings that think and feel just like us. What a clown take.
How do you know that?
Allow me to play a sad song on the world's smallest violin 🤏
They are whales. That's the point I was trying to make. Dolphins and orcas and sperm whales and all kinds of porpoises are all whales. Sorry if that was not clear. I was just trying to point out that calling a dolphin or an orca a whale is just as correct as calling a sperm whale a whale. That you don't have to differentiate between dolphins and whales, because dolphins are whales. Toothed whales.
Yeah, and it's human nature to turn into a whimpering bitch when you're cold, alone, and hungry too.  Just look up the history of literally any war and read the accounts of the ground troops.
I mean in Disney it works.  And in inspirational videos.  But I feel like the odds of them releasing the orca anywhere near it's original pod is pretty much nill   The ocean is pretty big
No. They don't. They exhibit signs and perform activities which resemble human activities, so human beings call these by the same name and assume they are motivated by the same purpose.  But there is no method by which this can be verified. It is impossible to communicate with them in a way that confirms this, and it is all based on the assumption that rational life would respond to stimuli in the same way, when not even two humans respond to stimuli in the same way.
They don't think like us due to the lack of the language skills that are unique to humans. (non human) Animals can't comprehend the word freedom.

This gets funnier every time I watch it. 39 trying to strip the ball but all he musters is a pitiful swat before eating absolute shit, 5 making the closest thing to a tackle attempt on the play (although still going for a big hit instead of a wrap up) but gets interrupted by 31 bowling into him, 31 also tries to go for the strip but has the largest windup of all time and just slaps Jefferson's nameplate, trips on the teammate he just bodied, and then whiffs the ankle nab. Just an absolute tackling masterclass
The MO should always be give the benefit of the doubt and let the play finish before blowing the whistle. Scoring plays are auto reviews anyway and its not like the other team is gonna lose the challenge if it’s a non scoring play anyway. Just let it ride
Don't think it would have changed the outcome of the game, but this was an egregious mistake by the officials. Also made worse because it was one of several touchdowns we had blown dead by an incorrect whistle before the play was over last season--poor Chandon Sullivan had two TDs wrongly called back in one game lol. For as lucky as that Vikings team was to win 13 games they also got fucked over *hard* by the refs quite often
We had so many of these type of plays lol
We're sorry that the officials blew that play dead Vikings, he deserved the TD both from his incredible moves on the play and the terrible tackling of our secondary. Hopefully with our secondary additions and further defensive development we can give JJ more of a challenge this year, but without the refs interfering against him.
Could have just cut off the title at "the officials blow"
Kirk Cousins is a fucking beast
Yeah, that should have been a touchdown. Inexcusable whistle when he wasn't clearly out of bounds.
He had this happen a few times.
Stupid bastards
That man is nuts
Can we stop roasting the Lions defense this morning, thanks
Imagine expending this kind of effort just to have it not matter
This pissed me off so much. The outcome *likely* would have been the same, but any half-wit fan would know to let him run and then review it.  Absolutely pathetic job by the refs, as usual.
It was incredible that the Vikings came back to win this game given how blatantly the refs were trying to stop them at the end.
Scoreboard
Officials should be trained to just let everything play out and review it.  How many times does a defense recover a fumble, blown dead and they couldn't flipped field position?
This is a pretty good clip to show why we went so hard on DBs this FA. This play involved 3 of our 4 best secondary players last year lmao.
That's what's so frustrating about this. Some of the plays they don't blow dead are so obviously dead, but then something like this that is questionable and they blow it dead so early.
Cant forget the Washington game where the ref bodied our safety
Sorry bro, we’re used to being on the receiving end of atrocities and i don’t even know what to do with this bad call in our favor. What do normal fans do when the refs aren’t screwing them?
I feel like JJ had 4-5 plays last year where he was downed at the 1
I mean, JJ had both the best game of his career and worst game of his career last year against the Lions. First time we played he went 3 catches for 14 yards.
Wrong game my friend we lost this game, you are thinking of the colts game where 2 fumble TDs got disallowed
When was the last time the Lions won the NFC North or even fielded a remotely competitive team that was capable of making the playoffs?
We had 2 fumble recoveries for TDs stolen from the same player in the same game last year…
I hate refs so much
> What do normal fans do when the refs aren’t screwing them?  Normally defend the bad call to the death.
I’m pretty sure Lions are on the top of that list of shitty call against a team or close to it
As a JJ fantasy owner since his rookie year, he has to lead the league by a mile in this category over his career.  He has at least 2-3 TDs per year rightfully or wrongfully called down at the one.
By the refs
That first game had simultaneously the best (Okudah) and the worst (Oruwariye) games I've seem a Lions CB have
That’s why we asked for Hockenson 😊
You are now an honorary Detroit Lions fan.
That feels dirty.
Y'all gifted us Jamo so we both won.
It was a facemask bro trust me
Skipping sentencing seems like a bad idea. The other shooter is 15 and has already murdered somebody and he only got 6 years total for the Robinson crime and the murder of somebody unrelated.
Cant get sentenced if you don’t appear in court  Kids a genius
He gone
I am shocked by this news. Shocked.
Bold strategy.
why was he out in the first place?
I'm starting to think this kid might not be a good guy....
They let this guy out on bail?
You can shoot a guy and not stay in jail until sentencing?   Sure innocent until proven guilty and all that, but that seems kinda crazy to me.
Time for dog the bounty hunter to get him
I do not understand at all why a person who is charged with, and pled guilty to, shooting somebody was ever allowed out of police custody.
Dumb of the judge to agree to remove the ankle monitor.
He shot someone why the fuck is he out on bail? Obviously a flight risk
Running out on a court hearing when you’re gonna be give 3-4 years (you get to get out at 21 and still have chance) is just dumb and tragic.  This is just sad all around
It’s DC..  They don’t prosecute for shit there..& if Biden didn’t veto that crime bill that they passed, it would of let more crimes go unpunished..   (See, the murder of that woman who was there for a concert, checked into her hotel room & was dead not even 2 hours later by a dude who shouldn’t of been let out)
Breaking news:  Piece of shit continues being a piece of shit.  More at 9:00.
I believe we have overcrowded jails/prisons...but people who commit or are tightly involved in violent crimes do not deserve the benefit of the doubt. And if they are underage they need to be in programs to help them succeed in life, not simply rot away in prison.  Its insane to me that this kid was allowed to be out before trial
> Via Fox 5, the teenager was scheduled for sentencing.   I initially read this as Via Fox 5 being the kid's name and thought it was kind of cool.
Surprised he was not in jail
That's what I'd do if I knew I cannot be arrested.
It's DC with easy bail rules. He's gone and he's not coming back.
When you reduce bail you reduce the incentive to show up for trial.
This is my surprised face
I mean, this guy's a real jerk.
well good luck after they catch him. way to exponentially get more time.
Over/under on how many more years of lenient criminal prosecutions before American politics, as usual, vastly swings the opposite direction and overly punish again?  5 years? Maybe 10?
Given DCs utter indifference to law & order I'm not at all surprised.
Criminals fail to obey the law.  News at 11.  When they do locate this scumbag, he'll get a slap on the wrist and go right back to committing more crimes.
Seriously zoom court on attempted murder charges?  &#x200B;  Justice system in this country is a joke.
Super sad that kids throw away their lives before they even begin. I was thinking about sports, traveling, and girls at 17. I went to a HS that had more at risk students but the teachers and principals put in the extra effort to make sure these kids knew that people cared for them and help set them up for a better life.   Ofcourse they need to be held accountable but we gotta prevent guns from getting into the hands of the young, dumb, and impressionable.
Pat, I’d like to solve the puzzle.
There are going to be a lot of takes in this thread about whether or not this person should have been out of jail pending sentencing.  Anyone that pretends to have a simple answer to that issue is pushing something.  It’s a complicated thing, and that’s ok.
Not to pardon the fact of shooting someone in any way, but just a reminder that black children are 18 times more likely to be tried as an adult for crimes they committed as a minor than white children.
Someone better get him, he needs to have consequences for shooting the man with the best hats
He's a runner he's a trackstar
Send a crew of hitters to find him like they do John Wick
😂😂😂 at least this gives the everyday people to see what happens in the real world. Maybe if he shot someone he shouldn't have had a bond?🤔
Classic DC
Absconder!
We need an express lane for the electric chair when it comes to open and shut cases. If there is no doubt then let’s stop wasting time and resources. Scum has no place in society
This country is so soft when it comes to sentencing for gun related offences.  Just like car related offences that result in injury or death.
Confinement until 21 is the maximum for juvenile crimes in DC
I'm torn man. You kill someone 6 years doesn't feel like anywhere near enough but I'm a big proponent of rehabilitation and I feel like a 15 year old deserves a chance again. Puts me in a confused mindset for real.
Don’t have to pay your Margin call if you delete the app.
I mean if he’s going to jail might as well run
Was he ever in?
Pretty much everyone gets out on bail unless it’s a truly heinous crime and/or the person is a serious flight risk, like fleeing the country flight risk, not just skipping out on sentencing
Because DC has decided not to hold minors accountable for any crimes they commit.
The 8th amendment of the constitution
DC hasn't had a cash bail system since the 90s. A judge just either lets someone out or decides they're too dangerous to be released and... doesn't.
Hasn’t been fully convicted yet right. I mean they produced the bail low enough for him to get out jail. But at the same time can you hold a guy in jail since august for non conviction. My opposition would be to hold his bail higher if you can prove he did it as a prosecutor.
dude should’ve gotten life no parole to begin with.
Is it mandatory? I read of one guy who said he just didn't want the point driven home at how much he f'd up. Dude wasn't running, he just waited at home for the cops to pick him after.  Admittedly in that story the cops got confused as to who was picking him up and which jail he was going to and no one ended up picking him. Only came to light when they tried to release him and everyone said he was somewhere else. Maybe the guy is hoping he lucks out too. At least in the above story dude turned his life around with his second chance (not advocating that we don't send people to prison I just like the story).
I'm genuinely surprised I found someone else who understands what is going on.  In Portland about 70% of people fail to appear in court and nothing happens to them for it, we don't have the manpower to track them down since we cut the police.  It is happening in DC / NYC / Baltimore / etc.  No point in showing up for your court appearance if nobody looks for you and you get no bail every time.
Jails are overcrowded because of the closure of asylums and the failed war on drugs. And conveniently we can blame Reagan for both
Central Park 5 are why they deserve the benefit of the doubt
Why is it insane that he was allowed out before trial?
Dibs
Via Fox 5 St Brown
The DC government is a joke…nothing about this is surprising.
Are you really???
DC doesn’t do bond bruh shut up, you either get out off the judges say so or you don’t, fed cases don’t even allow bond, which all of DCs cases are.
2028 election season, so 5 years.
Okay...but it was a Black male teenager shooting a young Black adult so why are you trying to make it a racial issue?
It because they are a minor. A lot of game and organized crime syndicates have minors do the dirty work because it’s really hard for them to significant time if they are under 18.
Buddy come move to Canada where you can kill 5 people and be out of jail in 5 years, America is still reasonably strict on violence
States like California, Washington, Oregon, NY, refuse to punish violent criminals period, regardless of if they used a gun/knife/hands.   They're out on the street the same day thanks to nonsensical bail laws and the unwillingness of District Attorneys to prosecute certain crimes
Car related offenses *should* be treated much more lightly than gun related offenses. Causing a car accident isn’t an intentional thing. There obviously must be some degree of punishment for it, especially to ensure that society is aware those crimes will not go unpunished. But there’s a fundamental difference between a teenager being an idiot and choosing to drive recklessly and a teenager intentionally killing someone.
Is the goal rehabilitation or retribution?   Generally European nations will wipe clean the slate of a convicted minor when they come of age. Otherwise you're just crystallizing a career criminal.
I don't have any problem with soft sentencing, but we should be upset with our complete failure to rehabilitate criminals, and also victims of crimes.
Some parts of this country are, especially ones run by the most anti-gun prosecutors in the country. Unusual.
What are you talking about? Most of the country has sentencing ENHANCEMENTS that add time if a crime is committed with even the presence of a gun. It doesn't even have to be fired to tack an extra 10-20 years on.
Car crimes yes but the shooter was 15 that's a child
Soft as compared to what other nation? The problem is that this country is soft on billionaires.
We’re literally not though. We have the highest incarceration rate in the world and treat minors like dog shit. In some states you’re more likely to get life without parole as a black child than a white adult.
The alternative is to send a literal child to prison for the rest of their life so maybe just shut the fuck up..?
We have auto sentencing in RI. If you murder with a gun auto life sentence
I sure as shit knew right from wrong regarding MURDER by age 16. This little shit should be behind bars for life.
Depends on the state
So either you believe that prisons are meant to reform or you believe that prisons should be meant to keep people in away from us.  If you believe it’s meant to reform, you can hardly expect a minor who committed a murder to have a chance at reforming with a sentence longer than 6 years. Any longer, and he’s entering the workforce for the first time as person in their mid 30s. Hardly a transition that gives the person a chance to reform.  If you don’t think people should be getting let out for these types of crimes, then it should just be a life sentence for this minor.
He already got a second chance, and then he shot someone else.
The kid who has killed someone and shot a second person should get another chance?
Maybe he just needed to get that 2nd murder out of his system and now hes 100% ready to be a good guy now.
Ill never understand this. Kids from the age of like 6 know that hurting others is bad, kid had nearly a decade of knowing the consequences for these actions and still did them. Ontop of that, if he was serious about rehabilitation he wouldnt be skipping his court mandated appearance.   Some people cannot be rehabilitated, no matter the age.
Literally murdered someone then shot another person… doesn’t deserve anymore chance. Should be rotting in prison for life.
Na, fuck that 15 year old. Dude will never amount to anything
Rehabilitation doesn’t work the majority of violent criminals. Especially in the type of prison system in this country (that’s a completely different can of worms). People will continuously fight for lighter sentencing and then you see a news story about the criminal murdering or harming someone again. Only 6 years for taking someone life is criminal in itself. That’s a joke
Everyone needs a second chance until that little punks got a gun shoved in the face of your mother or baby mama with your kids in the car.  Fuck him
Na. Fuck them kids.
It's tough because not everyone is reformable, but everyone certainly deserves a chance at rehabilitation. Even tougher when the person in question is so young.
Reddit is amazing. A normal person comes on here, admits to not having an absolutist mindset (I know, reddit hates nuance), and gets downvoted because he doesn't have absolute answer to the world.
You’re weird but your logic matches these dumbass DAs so shoot for the moon you’ll be a great DA or politician!
Holy fuck. You were downvoted this heavy for having a non-absolute take?  I absolutely agree with you. The United States only focuses on punishment with no rehabilitation.  Look at Finland. Their jail system focuses on rehabilitation and they have one of the lowest crime rates in Europe.
Heavy downvoting going on here, but you’re right. You’re a product of your environment and at 15 and 17 respectively you still have plenty of time to surround yourself with better people, unfortunately in the US prison does not do that; rehabilitation is something that has to be done by both sides of the penal system and at this moment in time neither are interested in it.
Fuck the people downvoting you. I think everyone would feel better about it if prisons in the US were actually rehabilitative, and didn't feature on average a 40% 1-year recidivism rate.  Can't feel great about it from a punitive stand point, and can't feel great about it from an improvement and betterment standpoint either. Hard to feel good about it from any angle.
idc if the kid was 5, 10, 20, etc. if someone kills someone, they should get life no parole.
Unfortunately you came to the r/nfl subreddit with a humane opinion so of course people are gonna downvote and be to much of a coward to explain why
The problem is the current prison system is not built for rehabilitation. I do not know want to take any of the personal responsibility off of the guy, but I do think it’s important to acknowledge we aren’t going to arrest and jail our way out of the crime problem in DC or this country. We have the largest prison population in the world and clearly that hasn’t fixed anything. We need multifaceted systemic reforms to our criminal Justice, education, mental healthcare and healthcare systems. We need programs to address substance use, poverty, and homelessness. We need more gun control legislation. We need a lot of change and unfortunately in many ways we seem to be going in the opposite direction.
You got downvoted super hard, but did you realize this was a 2nd offense and he'd already killed someone and got back out then did this? Would that change your opinion? Rehabilitation is what we should focus on, but our shitty system just makes it worse.
A fellow regard I see.
This guy options
Matt Levine is that you?
He's 17, highly doubt he's facing a life sentence. So when he eventually does get caught, he's only extending that jail stay.
Yea like he shouldn’t do it but I’d do the same if I was facing serious time. Just gotta make sure I’m not in that situation
Been there, brother
> heinous crime  I know there are worse horrors out there but how is shooting someone not up there as a very serious crime?
My brother in Christ why do you have Vikings and Packers flair?
Attempted murder is a heinous crime.
People like to cherrypick which rights are important and which aren't lol. The justice system is inherently flawed without right to bail.
DC abolished cash bail systems back in the 90s.
Has he been charged or has he been convicted? I think it’s the first and this wasn’t actually sentencing, the author of the tweet is confused.
I don’t think unreasonable to draw the line around violent crimes and flight risks.  Letting most other people go free on bail is probably the right thing.  A violent crime, especially a shooting should be grounds for house arrest at the very least.
Yeah, it's frustrating because the movement started as one I supported, keeping non-violent drug users out of jail. Now it has morphed into the current state of affairs where people who committed serious violent crimes like this one are just being given home confinement and disappearing when they're due in court.
Then why are they holding a sentencing hearing
yea they do dumbass, stop speakin on a city u don’t know nothin about
Every other person in the US has the constitutional right to their own physical integrity. Gun violence threatens it, so that means denying bail is a weighing of fundamental rights.  I remember reading he was a repeat offender who shot someone else less than a year before.  Denying bail is not a cruel and unusual punishment under those circumstances.
Whoa somebody pulled out their pocket Bill of Rights
Which is the right way to do it as long as the judge accurately assesses which people are too dangerous or flight risks to be released. Clearly that seems to be an issue if this kid was let go
Why they letting someone who was found guilty of shooting someone out
That's fucked up.
He's plead guilty, he was just awaiting his sentencing.   Idk how after a guilty plea of shooting someone you're still walking free on the streets. Keep him in jail until sentencing and just count it as time served.
He's under 18 in DC. The only way he gets life is if he is the Beltway sniper 2.0. They literally get away with everything
or at least 25 years with no bail for 20 of those years
Source on that 70% estimate?
Apparently Reagan was so powerful that none of the presidents that followed him could change anything even after he died.
Bail for the crazies and the drug offenders. Lock up for the violent offenders and the rapists. It's not that hard.
This is sentencing so after a trial
Because he was involved in two separate shootings, one was murder.
Because the carceral system disproportionately prosecutes black teenagers as adults regardless of whom they commit the crime against. The problem is systemic, not a function of the victim.
🎶Heeeeey don't pay no mind. If you're under 18 you won't be doing any time🎶
There's a great documentary series on Hulu where they talk about gangs and how they use the youths. They literally show a cop just releasing a kid who they stopped with an illegal gun because they can't do anything about it.
It’s not just minors…  https://www.q13fox.com/news/seattle-judge-releases-gang-member-accused-of-mass-shooting-to-home-detention-with-his-grandmother.amp
if we introduced life in prison for minors as young as 10ish, maybe they’ll be scared straight to come to court.
Yup and they'll get to watch TV and play basketball all day. Basically an upgrade from living in shitty neighborhoods in Canada
I'm not your buddy, *pal*.
Yeah, no, Canada has much stricter sentencing for murder charges. Mandatory life sentence with no parole for 25.
Ummm I'm pretty sure you're wrong about Washington.
Right.  I was referring to DUI, vehicular homicide, etc., not car accidents in general.
Generally speaking yes but what about intentionally running someone over? Someone like Darrell Brooks deserves life in prison or the chair
I disagree. Reckless driving is taken too casually in the USA. There is absolutely no reason for anyone to die for the sake of being able to use cars. Driving over speed or carelessly should be punished the same as recklessly discharging a firearm.  But culturally they are very different and thought of differently. That’s why one happens much more often than the other, despite the consequences being the same for the victims.
It’s very hard to prove intent in those cases. And they’re almost always the result of distracted driving, which should be punched severely when it results in death.
I mean I feel like that depends and it’s really easy to draw a distinction. Non-violent criminals deserve rehabilitation, violent ones are going to need some retribution. Shooting people is going to need some punishment.  17 year olds are dumb and impulsive, but shooting somebody isn’t just dumb and impulsive.
Can we please stop with the European country comparisons? So many are homogeneous with total populations the size of one of our smaller major cities.  The issues there might as well be a different planet than the issues we have here. What works there for criminals simply doesn't work here.
Those European nations actually (try to) rehabilitate you though, so the lighter sentencing makes sense. In the US, they put minors in prison with a light sentence and don't teach them shit, so they're back out doing the same thing in no time. It's the worst of both worlds, really.
Prison should be about rehabilitation and I hope we address that soon. But in the meantime the realistic accomplishment should be keeping repeat offenders from victimizing innocents.  "Sorry our prison system doesn't rehabilitate people, but until it does we just have to let these people out after a couple of years each time and hope they don't kill someo-oops they already did, let's try again" is a ridiculous way to approach things. It's not about punishment, it's protecting society from them.
You don't have a functioning society if you fail to hold people accountable for literal murder.
The goal as far as I'm concerned is reducing gun violence by keeping anyone who commits a violent crime involving a gun off the streets.  I would also prosecute the person who gave the offender the gun if it was an illegal transaction.  It's the best way to reduce gun violence that has a realistic chance of being implemented.
The failure to rehabilitate is a small concern compared to the failure to create a peaceful society that doesn't pump out criminals.
>I don't have any problem with soft sentencing  The victims and their families probably do.  Especially when it's a repeat offender.
Japan and Singapore, both of which I've spent time in.  What do billionaires have to do with gun crime?
Yes, literally throw him in jail for the rest of his life. “Oh no he’s just a kid” doesn’t hold water when he murdered someone and tried to murder another.
Shut the hell up. It’s hilarious how dumb Redditors act like teenagers are completely incapable of making any decisions. Pretty easy to not kill someone.
How could we have known he was capable of doing such a thing again
Well yeah but what about third chances?  Doesn't everyone deserve a third chance?  Gonna guess this 15 yr old just can't play football though.
Sure sure, but what efforts were actually made for rehabilitation?
At 15 and 17 they should know better. I’m sure their situation / parenting are partly to blame, but it’s not like these kids just made a one time mistake to get to this point.
I’m confused how he even came up with bail in the first place.
I don’t think it’s fair to treat people as adults when it suits you and treat them as children when it suits you. If you think a 15 year old should be treated like an adult when they break the law, then you should also treat them as adults when they do not break the law - they should get to vote, own firearms, and etc.  It’s totally reasonable to say that a 15 year old is old enough to know better, but it’s very much not reasonable to withhold rights in some areas because they’re not old enough to know better, but grant consequences in other areas because they are.
>Na, fuck that 15 year old.  I don't approve of that at all.
> People will continuously fight for lighter sentencing and then you see a news story about the criminal murdering or harming someone again.    Literally happened in DC over the weekend. 40 year-old career criminal stabbed a woman to death in her hotel room.
Yeah people still deserve a second chance.   Obviously it’s very easy to say “no second chances” when you were directly impacted by the crime but from an objective point of view yes they do.   The problem with the United States prison system is we only focus on punishment.   Look at Finland and their prisons. They focus on rehabilitation and they have one of the lower crime rates in Europe.
I feel like this is the point of long sentences with possibility for parole. Has this person rehabilitated? Are they remorseful? Is there a higher likelihood of them doing this again?    Giving a 15 year old consistent chances to show they have changed is great…releasing a sociopath into the general public is kinda not.
Everyone here is also lacking reading comprehension. The comment said everyone deserves a second chance, but six years seems way too short for a murder. He’s not saying he deserves a second chance after the fucking Robinson shooting too.
I appreciate someone not having absolutist views, but his response is weird in reply to a specific case where this person murdered someone and then committed armed robbery a year later. For most people, someone is beyond rehabilitation at that point
Full of lemmings. They see a few down votes and pile on.
This country is *far* too willing to throw people into the prison system, take away their rights (and thus many opportunities to better themselves & break the cycle), provide zero support when they get out, and then use recidivism as a preemptive justification for why we shouldn't make an attempt at rehabilitation or even showing basic human fucking compassion.  The amount of people here who feel comfortable passing judgement on whether another person should spend 60+ years trapped in a place where they will be subject to humiliation and physical/psychological abuse is appalling. This place is rotten.
We have rehabilitation, it just sucks and most criminals treat it as a joke.
Finland as a country has about the same population as the DC metro area. Also, what works in Finland wont work in the US given Finland is basically a non diverse country with around 95% of its country being ethnic swedes or finns who share common belief systems and cultures.      So unless the US manages to create cities with basically 1 dominant ethnic belief system and get everyones buy in there can be no true rehab as no one can agree on what being "rehabilitated" means.
I checked reddit to so many comments and had no clue my comment would be that voted in any direction
> Hard to feel good about it from any angle.  I feel pretty good about people that shoot multiple people not being on the streets still to shoot more people.  But IDK, maybe not wanting more people to get shot is just a me thing.
True, but in this case the kid shot someone and murdered someone else, he should at least get 25 years.
Yes the prison system is terrible but most of these violent criminals are beyond rehabilitation. Violence is instilled in an early age for most
Preach
5 years old?
That's what we need - baby jail!   Force all those mothers to have the babies, give them guns, get them in jail.  Money please!  ^(/s (just in case))
Take a life lose a life.
There is no benefit to society to try and rehab these type of criminals. In the best case scenario they still offer very little to society, in the worst case they just kill/rob/assault even more people
The system exists to provide a sense of justice to society. It does not exist to take bad apples and try to turn them into law abiding citizens. That’s something co-opted by weirdos who try to equate shoplifting a video game to literal murder. You don’t get to rehab from murder buddy, you get to sit in a cell and rot.
Uno Reverse
Can you not say that word anymore? Out of the loop on it.
didn’t the other one only get like 6 years?
You’re literally just gonna get caught and get more time added to your sentence.  You might as well go to court and attempted a plea deal.  That’s quite literally the best case scenario.
Robinson not being dead probably helps make that distinction.
It's America.
Because he wasn’t proven guilty for it yet ?
That should be the heinous crime we’re actually talking about
Because he wants attention.   Hot take I hate double flairs. Nobody actually cares about two teams, and if you do, you’re kinda not a real fan.
Yes, but people are wrongly accused of it all the time. Not offering bail means that person is imprisoned for a year or more for a crime they haven’t been convicted of. Which sort of runs against that whole “Innocent until proven guilty” thing we like to pride ourselves on
This is a sentencing hearing. He's already pled guilty. Why should someone who's pled guilty to a serious violent crime get bail before sentencing?
Bail shouldnt be given for violent crimes. These scumbags always end up doing shit like this or hurting someone else.
Thank you for a more measured response to Council's decisions.
I should re-phrase: they have recently decided to “go easy” on minors, even for violent crimes.  Hence why this kid has been running free. And also hence *part of the reason* why there’s been a recent increase in crime in DC by adolescents, because there’s less fear of actual jail time.
> Every other person in the US has the constitutional right to their own physical integrity.  I don't believe that's actually in the Constitution. That's less of a constitutional right and more of a general human right.
I mean it happens. Nothing is perfect. The cash bail system has people disappearing too.   It’s always a judgement call and it’ll never be perfect.
Facts. If he plead guilty guess I missed that
he killed someone’s and shot another. that’s enough for life with no parole.
I think if you shoot 2 people before your 18th birthday you're just a POS that society would be better off without
Nah F that you shoot at someone you deserve life I don’t care how old you are. You had the vile thought to KILL.
I take it you aren't aware of the cases being thrown out of Portland because of lack of public defenders?  https://apnews.com/article/health-oregon-covid-portland-a13c2ecf6e4648272dfa12fb9244b7a6  > More than two-thirds of the dismissed cases are felonies; in 53% of them, property crime was the primary charge. The next most common primary charge was for weapon crimes, which accounted for 16% of dismissed felonies, while person crimes, which include assault and robbery, accounted for 12%.  It is an absolute nightmare here right now.
Sadly enough, he was underestimating the percentage.  "KATU looked at court records for people released to pretrial supervision in felony cases twice or more since the start of 2021 and found nearly 80%, or 196 out of 247 people, skipped court at least once, some more than ten times.   One in four (at least 64 of 247 people) never reported for court-ordered supervision, some more than once.  Despite this, judges continued to release people from jail."  https://katu.com/news/katu-investigates/court-records-shows-multnomah-county-judges-release-people-who-skip-court-supervision
You don't understand. Everything wrong is because of the *other* party. The reason *my* party hasn't fixed it is because of...reasons, but let me assure you, they want too! That's why I keep voting for them. When it's fixed, we can tackle more important issues so I see no reason why my party wouldn't fix this immediately if they could.
Gold worthy comment haha. My man.
Well, this must be utopia for you as NO criminals are being prosecuted and instead just being let out to do whatever the hell they want...like this kid
Yeah, that's the solution.
Surely locking up 10 year olds for 30 years is the morally correct thing to do! Very good point sir
Is there any evidence long sentences or the death penalty actually scare away these crimes?   You usually either have:   1) Someone desperate enough to risk it  2) Someone impulsive or dumb (like children/teens usually are) enough that they don't care.
Perfect. And then we can have drag performances as punishment in these kid prisons every day
Studies have shown that threat of more severe punishments do not deter people from committing crimes, they just commit even more prolific and devastating crimes because *if I’m gonna go to prison for life might as well go all out*
Have you ever watched Dear Zachary? Do yourself a favor and don't.
No he's not, not for real. Especially liberal ran west coast states.
In that case absolutely, intentionally hitting someone with your car should be treated the same as shooting at them. But in general, someone making a terrible and reckless decision that unintentionally causes harm is different from someone intentionally causing harm.
> violent ones are going to need some retribution  Why?
You’re literally calling for retribution against someone for a crime they probably committed in retaliation for some slight. We treat minors differently because their brains are pretty bad at impulse control, especially if they have experienced trauma that goes along with growing up surrounded by crime/violence.
What does the size of the country have to do with it? Genuine question, I can't see how it would be relevant
>Can we please stop with the European country comparisons? So many are homogeneous with total populations the size of one of our smaller major cities.  This isn't just the case in small European countries, but in big ones like here in Germany too. And we're far from "homogeneous" anymore, thanks to decades of refugees (former Soviet Union, former Yugoslavia, Middle East, Africa, now Ukraine...) coming in and work immigration from all over the world.  >What works there for criminals simply doesn't work here.  It would, you just don't want it. Why are you being so disingenious?
There is no need for a privat prison to rehabilitate anyone in there.
Not only do we sentence people without doing shit, even worse, we actively make them into worse people doing crap like overuse solitary confinement and foster abusive environments (indirectly through negligence and inadequate staffing, mostly).  Part of the reason recidivism is so high here compared to other first world countries is that our prisons set-up people for becoming even worse criminals when they get out.  The American prison system is a tragic mess.
The reality is that in 2023 the goal is neither rehabilitation nor retribution. The goal is making money. We can't fix the justice system without fixing capitalism.
What the duck are you even trying to say? They literally go hand in hand. Our failure to rehabilitate leads to people committing crimes, and it leads to their kids being directly more likely to commit crimes
What about elevensies or afternoon drive-by? Do you think he knows about them?
Third time’s a charm, didn’t you know?
I mean I agree that our "justice" system doesn't come close to effectively attempting rehabilitation, but... dude we're talking murder followed by another attempted murder.
Usually by the time a kid is 6 or 7 they’ve already been influenced beyond help whether good or bad. Those early years are by far the most influential and if we’re talking about a 15 or 17 year old that’s a full decade too late to expect behavioral change.
Yeah but look at someone like Danny Trejo.  Dude was a career criminal and almost given the death penalty. Now he seems like a beloved guy and people love him.
That's the thing though, brain is still ~10 years away from being fully developed. They don't know any better yet. Then you combine environmental factors, there I'd a reason why life no parole is unconstitutional for minors now.
Because it is DC and DC's legal system is a joke. Just had a guy break into some woman's hotel room over the weekend and stabbed her 43 times. He had something like 30+ felony charges over the last 15 years. He was in jail for stabbing someone else. In December, 1st judge wouldn't let him out on bail because he was a danger. 2 weeks later, different judge releases him. 4 months later he kills the woman above.
Ever seen the wire?
He shot one person and failed to kill them, then killed another. Do you think the state would owe the family of the next victim to make up for their failure if rehab attempts fail? What course of action would be "fair" in that event?
Disgusting. Should never see the light of day again. There are so many people in this world. Some are just evil
In this situation wouldn’t his wasted second chance have been when he shot Brian Robinson?   I’m not sure you need a third chance when you’ve killed someone and recklessly endangered a second person.
> Look at Finland and their prisons. They focus on rehabilitation and they have one of the lower crime rates in Europe.  Finland has like, what, 4 million people in it? Maybe 5.  It’s an apples to oranges comparison on the United States to any of the Scandinavian or Nordic countries due to vast differences in societal, well, nearly everything.
Their lower crime rate has nothing to do with their justice system and everything to do with their demographics
He’s only talking about the murder case. 6 years for a murder is way too low, but also with the kid being so young and believing in second chances those two thoughts clash in their head.
It’s not about what he did, but the fact that he is a kid.  Forget the fact that the prefrontal cortex is not fully developed until 25 (another 10 years for this kid), but he’s not even a legal adult for 3 more years.  He can’t serve in the military or vote.  He can’t even drive at 15.  It’s heartless to not at least consider the ramifications of locking up a literal child for the rest of their life, before it even had a chance to begin.  He’s clearly been raising in an awful situation out of his control (as every 15-year-olds life experiences are out of their control).  Take a sociology class.
Might as well just execute him then.
Shhhh, you can't point out that what works in European countries would never work here.
25% of Norway inmates are foreigners to the country. Yet they still have a very low recidivism rate. It’s not a cultural difference lol.   Regardless even if it was so what is your suggestion? To keep the prison system the same in the US? It fails citizens and prisoners alike. The excuse of “well the US is different” can’t be an excuse to continue poor prison systems.
Yeah you weren’t like free this man lol. You just said it’s a complicated situation all around. Wild to see the reaction on this.
You feel good about a person who attempted murder only getting a handful of years? Or knowing they will definitely be getting out, just likely in an even worse state than they went in?  If you feel good about that, that's definitely just a you thing.  The guy was getting downvoted for lamenting that 6 years isn't enough for trying to kill someone, but he'd also like to hope that the person who did it would get better in that timeframe despite knowing he likely wouldn't.
Did you ever consider the underlying issues on this violence is perpetuated? Or is the only solution to keep overcrowding prisons that don’t work at rehabilitation, basically turn people out worse than before, and make nobody safer?
In which case, even if you believe that to be true there would have to be a better solution than releasing someone you know is going to violently re-offend back into the general population.  Also, considering the piss poor attempt at rehabilitation being made, it's kind of hard to say with confidence that anyone is beyond rehabilitation, they may just be beyond the trainwreck we currently call rehabilitative.
5 may be pushing it but that’s the age where common sense comes in. you know not to kill or hurt anybody. so they should do the time.
it’s not baby jail if the child is a murderer: they deserve to be in jail for life. they took another life, and know better.
This is such an intentionally dense statement.  Not every situation is the same, and not every person is the same.
Does this apply universally?
Thank you u/bigbootymilf99 for expressing this abhorrent position.
What type of criminal?
He's just highly regarded
Correct. We are all highly regarded regards.
Yeah. That has more to do with DC rules for Juveniles. He was 14 at the time of the shooting so he couldn't be tried as an adult, and the max sentence for kids is until they're 21. So he only got 6 years for shooting Brian Robinson and a previous murder which he plead guilty to.   I would assume the other one is getting tried as an adult, since in DC 16/17 year olds can be tried as adults.
Not in DC.   He’s 14 so he can’t be tried as an adult. If he went to sentencing, he’d me remanded until he’s 21.   He is leaving custody no matter what at 21 so him running is going shorten his actual custodial term.
I think he means when it comes to facing serious time, like multiple decades, might as well run because getting a few more years tacked on to your sentence is kinda meaningless at that point since you’re dying in prison anyway
I would rate "failed to kill someone on purpose" right up there with "succeeded to kill someone on purpose", but I guess that's just us non law-brained individuals.
He had already plead guilty. This was the sentencing hearing he skipped, not the trial or plea hearing.
I cared a little about the Colts for one year when Rivers took them to the playoffs. Although, we always fucked up the Colts in playoffs so it was easy for me. I can’t imagine the mindset that flairs division rivals. Just be Rob Lowe and wear an NFL hat
In Florida, for a crime as serious as this with implied prison time, you would be cuffed as soon as you entered your plea and held while you await presentence investigation and relevant motions to be heard almost always.   This just reeks of privilege. I'm simply arguing that it was appropriate for him to be out on bail until the change of plea.
It's highly situational, and no two crimes are alike. Making a blanket rule tends to lead to injustice, especially with marginalized people.
What you’re suggesting is to treat everyone accused of a violent crime as guilty until proven innocent. What happens when someone is falsely arrested for a violent crime? This story is from last year and sentencing was yesterday. So your approach would have innocent people sitting in jail for a year or so and totally destroying their lives.
>Hence why this kid has been running free.   It’s not uncommon for people to not be in custody prior to their sentencing. This kid was tried and was awaiting punishment. Not sure this qualifies as an example of what you’re complaining about
I agree cash bail isn’t the answer. But not letting a multi offender of gum violence leave isn’t asking for perfection it’s asking for common sense
At least if people disappear on cash bail they're out the money.  This dude could've skipped to CA for all we know and it cost him nothing more than a bus ticket.
I live in DC.
i wasn’t joking. he killed someone. he knows better. take his life away in a jail cell.
Normally i would agree, but in this case 25 seems appropriate, after a while i would hope he would be somewhat rehabilitated or he would want to start fresh, 25 years seems reasonable in that sense.
That's very true. The fact that he's so young though also means there's plenty of time for him to change. Do I think that's likely in America's prisons? No. But as a rule, I think rehabilitation should always be the goal, initially at least. Like it's better for everyone if this kid gets help, rehabilitates and gets released in his 20s or whenever and he gets a job and contributes to society. Better for him because he can live some kind of a life and try redeem himself. Better for everyone else because we don't have to pay for him in prison/the cost of other crimes he may commit.  Of course, it all hinges on whether an individual is able to rehabilitate
yea. you learn common sense when ur 5. maybe a bit above that age we should start doing life for murder no parole. i say 8-10.
It looks like now there’s a bill in committee to address this problem, on top of $10 million approved in December.  Not that these steps will fix it immediately but actions are being taken.  https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/2022/12/09/lawmakers-approve-10-million-for-public-defender-crisis/  https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/2023/04/03/amid-a-judicial-crisis-oregon-lawmakers-consider-reshaping-public-defender-system/
We need to drop the party system and move to one where the names of all eligible voters are put into a virtual hat and then someone is randomly selected to be President. It can't be any worse than what we have now.
If you actually deliver on a campaign promise you can't campaign with "I'll totes actually work on this during my fourth term, despite not having done it the three previous terms."
This kid isn't being let go to do whatever the hell he wants, only white kids who break the law.
You don’t want child prisons?
Clearly the right solution is to keep letting violent anti social people get light sentences because they are “children”. Because 15 year olds don’t have the wherewithal to just not murder people, clearly
Maybe not but the point is obviously its being taken advantage of, nothing is black and white, so whats the grey area in this?
I feel like I had a pretty good understanding of not shooting people when I was 10 years old.
they know better. they know consequences. that alone should be enough. they know not to kill.
These are 10 year olds that have killed someone right?  I'm fine locking someone like that up for a long time.
is there proof that releasing inmates go back to jail within 6 months? yes.
No not at all, it's pure lizard brain stupidity. This website is so bloodthirsty it's honestly crazy.
Scare away?  Its about keeping them away from harming others.  Do you understand the psychological hurdles you have to go through to try and kill someone?  Kids sometimes get caught up into stupid stuff like drug dealing or petty theft, but not multiple murders.
dude wtf? that’s messed up
studies also show that it’s useless to release inmates, because they’ll just go back to jail with 6 months-2 years.
Yeah if 5 bystanders are between you and life or the chair, they are gone also.
i’m not tryna be funny dude. don’t kill. everyone knows not to kill, even toddlers.
What's the relevance? Turner wasn't charged with murder in Canada, also that happened a long time ago
Because fuck them
There are plenty of kids surrounded by crime and violence that don’t murder people. Stop defending criminals.
That's delusional and not even true, and even if it was, murder is not justified for " a perceived slight" against someone
There is no need for a private prison. It's a literal slave farm rebranded.
Nobody said there was or wasn't, I don't think
You're not wrong. I'd love for us to adapt a more rehabilitation friendly prison system. The issue is the fact that we have very high conviction rates, and we lock people up for years over some petty bullshit.   I'm not going to pretend that I know how to fix it, but I just know this ain't it.
This has nothing to do with the private ownership of the means of production. Stop using "capitalism" as the boogie man when shitty government policies and politicians who are completely disconnected from reality and the lives of the average person are squarely to blame.
Rehabilitation happens after a crime has already taken place. What america is REALLY bad at is proactively getting in front of crimes so they never happen at all.  Wealth inequality, high levels of cyclical poverty, low economic movement, education requires huge amounts of debt, militarized law enforcement, lack of mental health supports  etc etc etc
It really should be common sense that if you don't want to be shoved into a box sniffing other dudes nutsacks all day that whatever you did, don't do it again.
Right because we never tried to help a young man better himself, we never took the time to teach any life skills, and then shocker he still sucks after being released. This isn't rocket science.
This sounds a bit like the Super Predators comment which Mrs. Clinton was making.
How many people do you get to kill/attempt to kill before society just keeps you locked away?
Imagine this many down votes for a totally true observation smh
Bro you don’t need to be 15 to know shooting someone dead ain’t right idgaf what their environment was like. I know tons of people who had bad childhoods who knew not to end someone’s life
>They don't know any better yet.  Oh come on, you can't use that excuse in this case. They're teenagers, which is plenty old enough to know that murder is wrong.
You're telling me that when you were 15 you thought it was ok to shoot and kill people?
So fuck the victim’s family right? A crime aa vicious as murder should have no excuses. Obviously they should have parole for when they are in their 40’s, but their brain’s developing has nothing to do with the crime.
You mean a tv show that was made up explicitly for the drama of the audience? That fake tv show the wire?
If you think we should treat people as adults younger, then that’s totally defensible. 18 is a very arbitrary line. What’s not defensible is drawing the line differently in different situations so that it suits you
Sure but we don’t really offer second chances in America when it comes to criminals.   This kid was 16. Obviously you know what’s right and wrong by that age but if your 16 doing shit like this multiple times there’s definitely a reason for it.   You commit a crime here you have no rehabilitation or assistance. You’re locked up you spend your time and then you get out. A lot of criminals can fall back into that lifestyle due to just flat out not knowing anything else. They have no opportunities to do anything else. We don’t set our citizens up to prosper after life in prison.   I’m not saying everyone can be rehabilitated. Obviously we have circumstances where some people are just bad people and no matter the assistance they’ll never be a functioning person in society but I’d wager that more often than not if we set criminals up for success for life after prison they’re going to be a better person for it.
Yeah America and Scandinavian countries are definitely different population wise and culturally however they’re an example of a working system and Americas prison system is not.   Advocating for improvement shouldn’t be stopped because the countries are different. You can take inspiration from others to fix the obviously broken system we have here.
Every 16 year old knows murdering someone is bad
Almost as heartless as killing a person and shooting another.
> It’s heartless to not at least consider the ramifications of locking up a literal child for the rest of their life, before it even had a chance to begin  Maybe he should have considered the ramifications of shooting two people before he did that
Maybe if it wasn’t so expensive for taxpayers
People who have proven themselves to be dangers society should be removed from it (via imprisonment, not execution) so they can’t hurt anyone anymore. If you release a multiple offender of murder / attempted murder, you might as well execute a random person.
They have a recidivism rate of 36% within 2 years per this site, which is the exact same as the US.  [https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/recidivism-rates-by-country](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/recidivism-rates-by-country)  Recidivism is tracked differently by every country so I doubt we will ever get a true stat. So apparently the foreigners in Finland keep getting in trouble regardless of how progressive their system is. I'm not saying we don't need change, im saying that what one side thinks is the right way to do it is what the other side will call facism, racist, big government control, etc etc.      Finlands demographics are far more palpable for the kind of cultural shift within their govt systems than the US.
It's fine to adress poverty which is the main underlying issue but it really shouldn't absolve personal responsibility.   6 years is not enough for a 15 year old to come out at 21 after shooting 2 people and killing one. He's most likely shot and possibly killed other people as well.   Maybe 20 years and he's in his mid 30s I could see possibly giving him a second chance but murdering people over literal pocket change is fucked up and way too goddamn common.
"Fix the reasons for the violence in the first place" is one of those cool things I see thrown around on Reddit a lot. It's even a really slick political stance that's pretty often thrown around. The problem is nobody has any idea how to reform society to fix it with minor intrusions, so it's really just empty words that are very easy to say when you're not the one fixing the problem. You'd probably need full societal or economic reforms to do it, so it's sort of out of the question.  So yes, for right now, locking people the repeatedly cause violent crimes is the solution *and* makes people safer.  Also, it's a hard stretch to say it turns everyone out worse than when they came in. I think you've watched "Get Hard" a few too many times.
I’m honestly very surprised at the comments in this thread. The echo chamber of Reddit I completely expected to be blasted by saying things like people deserve to be locked up, beyond rehabilitation etc.
This is great satire. I can just imagine the 5 year old that does not even understand the concept of death going on trial for murder.
I don’t believe that anyone who kills anyone deserves rehabilitation or redemption.  Whether anyone agrees really does not matter. There is no place is society for people who have no regard for other people’s lives.
The ones that shoot multiple people
Do you really think a 17 year old is getting 40+ years for attempted carjacking and a non-fatal shooting? He's not dying in prison.
I don't think "on purpose" really applies though. From my understanding it was a carjacking and Robinson ended up getting shot trying to take the gun. That's the difference between attempted murder and assault with a deadly weapon. If they wanted Robinson dead he'd be dead.   I'm not trying to defend the kid at all, what he did was terrible. But there is (and imo should be) a legal distinction between using a gun to threaten and using a gun to kill.
There needs to be an escalation in punishment for worse crimes to act as a deterrence. In this case, if the teenager shot robinson and thought to himself “attempted murder is the same punishment as murder” then he has no deterrence from shooting again. End result is lesser punishment when the victim lives, but knowing the difference in punishment may be why the victim lives.
Yeah that is absolutely not how it works and it absolutely should not be how it works either.  It makes a very big difference whether the victim  is alive or not lol Y’all just want prisons even more overcrowded than they already are. It’s fucking crazy the shit i’m seeing here. No empathy, no nuance, just ignorance.
As someone extremely knowledged in Bird Law I can assure you this is correct probably.
The Rob Lowe in a NFL hat picture is one of the funniest NFL related pictures I have ever seen. It fits his character from Parks and Rex perfectly.
In 2023 with the amount of digital evidence we have you should not get bail if there is solid evidence showing you committed a violent crime.   Read up on UFC fighter Walt Harris’ daughter…judge gave bail to a guy that was found in a car with his buddies and another guy they had kidnapped/almost beaten to death. He then kidnaps Walts daughter and kills her while on bail.   This shit happens all the time. Violent criminals should not be released back into society before their court date when there is overwhelming evidence of what they did.
Not to mention the practicality of it. Where are you going to keep all these accused people until their trial?
This person has already plead guilty, so yes, they should be treated as guilty.
Uh for someone who shot a person yes it is pretty uncommon actually. There’s usually a hefty bail (>$100k) or no bail at all.   Both this 17-year old + the 15-year were basically let go to some bullshit “Youth Intervention” program, not long after which the 15-year old killed someone in a drive-by and this 17-year old committed assault with a deadly weapon.   So yes actually, letting teenagers who shoot people run free is in fact exactly what I am complaining about.
>But not letting a multi offender of gum violence leave  First it's Juicy Fruit and the next thing you know they get Hubba Bubba. When will it end?
25 years and releasing him is the worst idea. all he knows is jail and robbing. that’s all people will do when they get out of jail after doing 25.
Sadly our local government is as useful as a third asshole.  They will divert those funds or skim them, then blame the eastern part of the state.  All our lawyers are leaving Portland, there isn't any way to fix that.
The children yearn for the cells
If they murdering people, ya I do
It’s called “Juvie”
I remember high school, me and my friends used to stay out late, sneak alcohol from our parents cabinets, murder four or five people a weekend, throw toilet paper at peoples houses, it was wild times.
Or wait how about we… implement smart gun control laws.
You're seeing the same thing happening in Teaching and it's one of the largest drivers of people quitting the profession.  Kids are pretty much untouchable, punishment wise, in our current society.   The pendulum swung *way* too far to the other side while correcting for all the horrible abuse in previous generations.
The answer is more funding is needed to give these kids an alternate to gang life, but no one wants to pay more taxes to do it
agreed, some of these comments have my scratching my head. Some of these people are delusional. One guy said its a money issue and we need to pay more taxes so teenagers dont murder people. It reads like satire.
yikes
> if we introduced life in prison for minors as young as 10ish, **maybe they’ll be scared straight to come to court.**  This is the comment I was responding to  If you want to prevent more damage we should focus on improving the environment so kids aren't even killing a person, let alone multiples.
Hmm maybe cause they don’t have any actual rehabilitation efforts in jail?
Your logic is shit, stop embarrassing yourself
Omg, I’m not saying they shouldn’t be in prison, I’m saying that the purpose should be to keep them away from society and attempt to rehabilitate, not for *retribution.*  Edit: also, saying that a person’s surroundings affect their risk-taking behaviors is not the same as saying that all people will become violent monsters. Understanding why people go from innocent baby to murderer is important.
What’s not true? Never said it was justified, but people with guns and poor impulse control do stupid shit. I’m not condoning it, I’m explaining it 🤣
Man, when I was a Lyft driver, I had a passenger that was pretty high up working at a private prison.   Creepiest fucking vibes this dude had
> when shitty government policies and politicians who are completely disconnected from reality and the lives of the average person are squarely to blame.  Why do you think these politicians behave in this manner? It's about power. The church used to serve this purpose; now it's money. Remove the incentives that hoarding money provides or there is no solution.
Yes agreed but locking people up and throwing away the key ensures that wealth inequality, debt, lack of education, and lack of mental healthcare are issues that will go unaddressed.
I get that you’re trying to be nice to the guy, but I think that argument should be saved for guys who haven’t already murdered multiple people.
I’ll take the downvotes. I knew it was coming but people have to wake up and stop pretending that changing grown and young adults is possible. If people want change they have to focus on a child’s upbringing rather than trying to reform people in a fucking prison.
7 for people under 18, 3 for 18-25, and only 1 thereafter
I don’t know. But we do know rehabilitation is possible for these people.
I am so tired of people using "their brain isn't fully developed!" as a blanket excuse to hand wave away any crime committed by a minor. 15 is a high schooler, they know literally murdering someone is wrong.
According to the SJC it's not old enough to be locked away forever for
At 15 kids make bad decisions and engage in horrible behavior. That's why the United States does not allow for them to be sentenced for life without parole. Simple as that.
It has everything to do with the crime, which is why it is considered a mitigating factor. That's the whole point lmao. Simple logic man  And who is saying fuck a victims family? Of course it's horrible. What am I saying that indicates fuck a victims family?
Yes that show, the one written by a former police reporter based on the experiences of his writing partner who was a former homicide detective. Everything was just made up for drama and had no basis in reality though
It’s not like none of what happens in that show ever happens IRL though.
Right, because society should be just as heartless as the people it claims are evil.
Just bring him to Texas. They'll do it for free
Sorry I used the wrong country. Meant to say Norway has 25% foreigners locked up.   Norways recidivism rate after 2 years : 20%  USA : 41%  Quite a big difference there and that’s a two year rate.   Norways 5 year is 25%. Americas is around 70%. That’s a massive difference.
Naw I’m just a actual person who has seen the effects of the criminal justice system both hands from law enforcement and people who have been convicted.   Its very easy to say that phrase is something people throw around with no thought when yourself haven’t actually taken the time to think about it critically. That would require actual work and thinking about someone other than yourself so I understand why that’s not easy. But their is a lot of good work on abolition and criminal Justice reform that’s very digestible. I could forward some ebooks over if you would like
5 is overexageration. okay i already said that. but that didn’t change the fact that they need to start giving people as young as 10 or even 8 life sentences. they already can go to jail, they know the consequences fully. no reason they should have a pass.
> I don’t believe that anyone who kills anyone deserves rehabilitation or redemption.   I know I shouldn't but damn it you got me...my boy scout troop leader accidentally killed a 3 year old when she suddenly ran head first into the street completely unexpectedly.  You're telling me he deserves life in jail with no parole for an accident that even the parents of the child held no grudge over?
So cops, Military, etc?
🤷‍♂️ young men in america have gotten more for less
Using a gun to threaten is explicitly saying “I will murder you if you don’t do what I say.” If you then use it to shoot them, it should be attempted murder.
Is there research to support those outcomes? It's my understanding that fear of harsher sentencing has been largely disproven as a deterrent to crime
A fucking kid almost murdered someone and we're supposed to be empathetic? Nah fuck that, don't care how fucking old you are if you're a murderer
We're the ones being ignorant while you want to show empathy towards someone who shot an innocent person over a car?  Right.
Everyone on Reddit is supportive of criminal justice reform right up until they’re confronted with the story of an actual criminal. Then it’s straight back to zero tolerance.  Like, don’t get me wrong, this kid needs to be jailed. But throwing out all the good reforms of the last few years because a story about a specific criminal pissed you off is also stupid
The evidence of crime is used during the case though. It's more dangerous to allow the legal system to keep people in jail as they see fit.
That’s a lot of words to say “I don’t believe in the presumption of innocence”
I got it! We can presume guilt before trial, build even more jails to disproportionately imprison the population, and fuck the constitution. This dudes a moron.
> Uh for someone who shot a person yes it is pretty uncommon actually. There’s usually a hefty bail (>$100k) or no bail at all.  The existence of a bail doesn’t make it uncommon?   >So yes actually, letting teenagers who shoot people run free is in fact exactly what I am complaining about.  So, you were talking about a previous incident you didn’t mention? How would people know that?   You seemed to be complaining about a lack of consequences for someone who had a sentencing hearing.
Then kill him. Life in prison is dumb. They dont provide anything and are just a cost burden. Either we spend some effort to rehabilitate or death penalty
Remember a few years ago when people were arguing that knife fighting was a [normal]( https://twitter.com/BreeNewsome/status/1384725341550305281?s=20) thing amongst teenagers?
Kids these days are so soft, wouldn’t last a minute back in the day smh
This right here. It’s clear that the 15 year old was able to legally purchase the gun used in the shooting. not a chance in hell did they obtain said gun illegally.
Well sure they would just also have to abide by the founding document of the country, which is where most of these “smart gun control laws” fall short
 The same shit was repeated over and over in the 90s. These parents don't value an education and sure as shit their children don't care either. We have like 30 years of data showing that parental involvement is the key, you can't force people to be good parents...and the answer isn't to just let these kids terrorize innocent people.
The answer is never simply throwing more money at a problem. Throwing money at a problem helps if that money is funding a good plan.  It's like saying I need to diet by eating less. Obviously in a vacuum eating less should help. But if I'm eating less, but only eating McDonald's and shitty foods than my diet isn't really going to be effective.
Because a ton of our tax money is getting wasted on stupid bullshit and it's almost impossible to live as it is. So obviously people are a bit hesitant to say "Yes Mr. Government, please take more of my money to solve another problem." All while watching the money get used on just about everything else instead of helping these kids. Can't imagine why people would resist lol.
lol thats the biggest bs I have ever heard, it has nothing to do with funding. Its a family issue.
They have all kinds of alternatives already, let's not act like this is the only choice they have, I come from a low income high crime and gang infested area and I never murdered anyone or joined a gang. Quit making excuses for these shit bags. They know damn well what they're doing and they have a choice.
they try. inmates don’t want rehabilitated they want money and they don’t wanna work so they rob and kill.
i may be embarrassing myself but i’m right
> Non-violent criminals deserve rehabilitation, violent ones are going to need some retribution. Shooting people is going to need some punishment.  The way I read this is he's saying violent criminals need some punishment *and* rehabilitation. But we can't just throw our hands up in their air and not provide *any* type of retribution whatsoever for violent criminals.
No, the purpose should be to punish them for the pain they caused others because that’s the closest we can come to justice.   This isn’t someone who made a mistake. This is someone who committed two separate murders. I don’t care about rehabilitating them. The point of the justice system is not to fix this person who clearly has no regard for human life. The point is to enact justice.
You're right, there's no history of countries trying that and running into the same issues because humans are stupid, selfish animals at the end of the day. We will have these problems until power is decentralized and smaller communities are emphasized.
I'm not trying to be nice. I don't believe in locking people up with no opportunity for release, and believe we should rehabilitate people who commit crimes.
I agree with you, but how do we handle the one’s that are too old to change? Cause I haven’t got any well thought out ideas
Yea, but it's not possible for the individuals they killed, and it doesn't take the pain away from their families. Life is what murderers deserve for taking away someone elses
You’re right but Reddit will advocate the death penalty for minors since they think justice is just the state’s revenge.
I’m not talking about the punishment, I’m talking about the crime. Your comment reads as if you believe they don’t know any better about murder because their brains aren’t fully developed. At 15 and 17, you know murder is wrong.
And that means we should just parole the kid again when he already shot two people?
>	It has everything to do with the crime, which is why it is considered a mitigating factor.   You think that age plays a role in the decision making of robbing and killing someone? Don’t know if you know this, but people much older than these two kill and rob people. Arguing that they wouldn’t if they were 18 is just silly.   People are downvoting because you are defending the indefensible here. You are focusing on the punishment, without holding them accountable. You sound like their attorney.   Are you?
Right but the dudes comment made it seem like it’s the situation for everything
Yeah free on my future social security.
Ok then, solve it for us. How would you tackle this problem?
It’s a good thing you have no say whatsoever in the judicial system then.
Why did you only quote part of the comment? Why clearly ignore the second part? If you can’t understand the nuance then that’s on you. Context clues are important, you are talking about accidental death on a post about someone who murdered someone on purpose.
If they are shooting innocent civilians then yes absolutely
Are you willing to give the cops that killed George Floyd a second chance after 6 years?
That’s not how the law works at all lol
First of all it wasn’t murder, it was an attempted armed robbery. There’s a big difference legally and in reality. Second of all, you have absolutely no idea what you’re talking about and you’re being aggressive for no reason lol   Go relax man, take care of yourself.
I dont think you understand the difference between sympathy and empathy.
Almost like they're different people.
People are in favor of criminal justice reform for minor things like drug offenses, they are not in favor of being soft on violent crimes like shooting a person in a carjacking attempt. That is lunacy and is how you push everyone open to reasonable criminal justice reform right back to a hard on crime stance.
Disagree, the law abiding public’s safety is more important than violent criminals’ freedom. If there is good evidence you committed a violent crime you should be in jail and the time served comes off your sentence.
You must have missed the solid evidence part. When there is solid evidence showing you committed the violent crime the judge should deny you the ability to go hurt other people before your trial.
My guy you’re missing my entire point. These kids shot Brian Robinson, went on to commit separate violent crimes, and basically no one thought they should be locked up because they’re “kids.” And the sentencing hearings for minors in DC lately have been *extremely* kind, hence why (according to my local police friends) adolescents seem to be less afraid of facing harsh consequences. And not surprisingly crime has risen.   Yes I believe in second chances, but I also believe in having to face serious consequences *before* you get that second chance, especially if your shot someone.
eh i kinda want to but he’s still a kid. not right to kill a kid. life in prison ensures that  i mean if he/she was over 16 it’s a different story.
Are you being sarcastic?       If so your sarcasm and sentiment suck.       You don’t see other countries with smart gun laws also struggling with large amounts of illegal weapons.
It goes even farther back than that. This country swings back and forth in how they want to deal with social issues but in this case it is crime. The crime rate in the 60s/70s and early 80s, when there was a more lenient take on incarceration periods and thus, there was more crime because more bad people weren't in jail. Late 80s and 90s saw hard tact to the level which resulted in a higher incarceration rate and a drop in crimes. Now, since the mid 2010s, we have moved back to the left under the "restorative justice" and progressive DAs it is a move back to the 60s and 70s. How long it will last depends on how long citizens will deal with it when they start electing more law and order types. But, unfortunately, I think we are in for a good decade more of this (and it is going to get worse before it gets better) when we will see a swing back.
The answer is to incentivize birth control monetarily
Yes that's why I said fund areas that will give kids a better access to higher education/activities that keep them from just sitting around all day. If the parents can't or won't help and the alternative is gangs of locals you know and be around, then the government need to be the ones that pick up the slack
That's why local legislators need to figure out the best way to use those funds allocated to them and what programs will give the best chance of succeeding. But that is an election issue, but only 30% (even less in most states) of the public actually vote in local elections
I mean yeah that's the problem with funding in every entity, no one wants to say they don't need more money or they will be the ones who get cut. Not saying it's an easy solution but realistically that's all we got
Electing people that believe the government shouldn’t exist is totally gonna fix the government. The problem isn’t the concept of government it’s the current US government being sold out to corporations. And without a government those corporations run even more rampant. We’ve done this same shit for the past like 100 years
People will fight for tax dollars to go to inner city schools but vote out elected officials if they don't want to use said dollars to entice a sports team or company...our priorities are fucked
I too love the “it’ll only take this much for everybody to get healthcare!!!” Like hmmmm that’s pretty close to the department of energy’s, atf/homeland security and FEMA’s budget, and they are horribly ran shit shows of organizations.
Cool, now what happens what that family has failed? Just say fuck them they are destined for shit so long as I'm not affected? Because idk about you, I want to goto my major cities and not be scared a drive by is about to hit my kid because two local drug dealers have beef
We've told them to pull up their bootstraps for 50 years and fuck all has been done, maybe it's time to grow up and realize people arent fucking perfect and everyone cant escape a horrible situation
I mean that’s just straight up racist lol
I’m saying that imprisonment should be for the purpose of benefitting society because the cost of imprisonment is to society. Punishment for feeling good doesn’t actually help anyone and won’t make the person less likely to commit crimes once out of prison.
I’m talking in a broader sense than just this case, but he sounds like someone we let slip through the cracks pretty early on. He wasn’t born a murderer, so what can we do to prevent this path for kids? Punishing them more harshly is not going to convince a teenager to behave better, especially a kid with a shitty upbringing.  But my point stands that you want revenge and “justice,” just like a lot of people that act out violently for their own sense of revenge and justice. No punishment undoes the crimes committed, so the sentence should benefit society because it’s fucking expensive to put people in prison.
No one here even mentioned the death penalty. Are we really out here defending murderers?
It's about decision making. Decision making is skewed at 15. The punishment us what it is because of this. It's called a mitigating factor. It needs to be taken into account. I knew drinking and driving was wrong at 17, still did it. I knew kicking someone in the head during a fight was wrong (and could have killed the person) but still did it. Plenty of things are done by 15 year olds that they would NEVER do at 35. That's the point.   So instead of "lock these animals up" how about we try to take steps as a society to help steer them away from a path where these things can happen in the first place.
He will be paroled again, regardless of what you or I think. That's the law.  When that parole comes, who knows
Who said people over 18 don't commit murder? Not me lol  And what I think does not matter. The United States Supreme Court thinks that age plays a role in the decision making of robbing and killing someone, that's why they ruled it is a mitigating factor and limited the ability to sentence someone for life without parole.   In no way am I defending the act by the way. Where would I have indicated that? I'm saying age is seen as a mitigating factor, which it is. And for good reason. That's why the goal of punishment should not simply be punitive, but rather rehabilitation.
Everything? They were just talking about bail, that's one thing
Just off the top I’m not sure on the facilitates in DC but let’s pretend they had enough(they do) in their discretionary budget to fund a correctional facility for young adults between 13-19 that is focused on Violent crimes. This would segregate them from the population but in actual practice actually have mental health , educators on staff with the goal of rehabilitation for their entire their at the facility. Instead of cells that aren’t actually livable a model close  to Sweden’s would do wonders to have human beings actually live and feel like humans instead of animals in a cage https://www.india.com/viral/these-arent-pictures-of-a-hotel-room-but-of-a-nordic-prison-cell-twitter-says-they-look-better-than-our-homes-4264868/   Restitution has to be paid to victims of any violent crime and I think the victim (Robinson in this case) and their family should have a say in how that restitution is paid whether is financial, time spent in this rehabilitation center, or something to show they’ve changed.   The way our Prisons are set up now they say they do a lot of what I’m proposing but if you’ve ever been around one you know that’s not true at all especially at  a prison this young man would be sent at. It’s not a easy problem to solve but it’s possible when we stop thinking in a punish mindset and a fix mindset
I mean the second sentence of your post is "don't argue with me because I'm stubborn" and the third sentence is "the same thing as the first sentence just reworded" so feel free to explain what context clue I missed by not quoting those.  As if by not quoting them I've dramatically changed your comment's meaning lol.
Well since only Jury’s can decide if someone’s guilty in the USA I’m guessing EVERYONE they shoot is innocent. So we gotta get working on this eye for an eye thing
If you follow the thread of comments were this started you should’ve been able to pick up that I would like people to actually get rehabilitated and get a chance at being in society as a productive member. Prison doesn’t do that.   Now a 16 year old murdering someone is different than a cop who was over 30 sitting his knee on man’s neck for 9 mins but neither according to life experience and statistics are going to come out of prison better members of society.
Was Chauvin a child when he killed George Floyd?
Have you seen somewhere that it was attempted manslaughter? The few articles I scanned through didn't mention the charges. If they shot a man while carjacking him and the DA let them plead it down to that, I would be very disappointed.
> You’re being aggressive for no reason   This is another thing that’s annoying about trying to have a grown up conversation on Reddit about criminal justice. Everyone is always in outrage mode on these stories because being angry on the internet is fun for people
Why the fuck would you show sympathy towards the criminal? LMAO  Hilarious you're calling out my understanding genius
I think there’s a ton of overlap. Social media is just very prone to group thing and emotional stimuli
So it’s soft to think that teenagers deserve a second chance? Not everyone who commits a violent crime is irredeemable.   I dont get why we focus entirely on punishment and not how to actually reform people. Society would be better off if we had a better balance of the two
Then you’re thinking we should run as a guilty until proven innocent system. That’s not how it works. If there’s evidence then that will be used in the courts to determine if someone is guilty through a trial. You are, at the very least, guaranteed a fair trial.
I didn’t miss it. It’s just a muddy, subjective term that’s ripe for abuse.
> My guy you’re missing my entire point.   Your point was that they don’t hold minors accountable in response to someone ditching their sentencing.
Other countries also have much better fleshed out mental healthcare and access to healthcare in general
I wonder if the fact that DNA evidence wasn't being used to help convict people of their crimes back then had an effect on that? The first time it was used in court was in 1986. That's partly the reason why the 70's had so many serial killers active at the same time. Not to mention that today there are cameras literally everywhere, home security systems are very cheap now pretty much anyone can afford them. Another tool that is used to help convict people of their crimes.
I mean that isn’t really true, or at the minimum you are sensationalizing it. We still incarcerate more people than we did in the 90’s. It peaked in the mid 00’s but is still very very high. The total crime rate is still way down, though has been relatively stable. The only thing that really has been going up is murder rate, and we still arnt even at the rate we were in the 90’s let alone 70’s.
I don't think it's quite so simple or easily done. I grew up in a not so great area and my school had free after school tutoring and the local church had after school activities to keep kids busy and there was a police athletic league (PAL) that offered boxing and basketball to youths and young adults.  Not many people participated in these free activities, it was cooler to drink, smoke weed, listen to music, and hang out. How do you encourage kids to participate in these free activities? The teachers would try their best but the vast majority of the kids wouldn't listen.
Or you know they could take some responsibility for where they are and change the culture (start valuing life, education and loyalty)but they won't because people like you love to excuse their behavior.
I think you're making incorrect assumptions based on my comment. I agree that the corporations are the biggest problem. However we as a people need to hold them accountable and stop praising politicians that we agree with. They're all shit.
Ask your self why it’s corporations that are the ones needing to buy power to expand, it’s because the government is the one with the sole power to actually do anything that majorly affects their business. Government has encouraged monopolies to propagate and handed it to them on a silver player, with the authoritative strong arm of the government protecting said monopolies
Precisely haha
Didn't say that was the solution. But until people get fed up enough to fight back the ridiculous bullshit the gov is pulling on us, then increasing our taxes won't solve the problem. Taxes are going up and crime still persists. These fucking dipshits have no clue how to help us all while they hide in their mansions.
I don't know what the answer is but i know sure for throwing money at the situation isnt going to do anything about it.
They don't have to pull up their bootstraps they just have to not act like assholes it's really not that hard buddy. Been there done that.
i’m not being racist ur looking to find sum to rage over.
I don't think punishment is to feel good, I think it's a deterrent. I disagree with the assertion that punishment is not a deterrent for the overwhelming majority of people.   I commute to work very early in the morning and there's no one on the highway. I could easily go 100 mph the whole way but I don't because I fear the punishment of getting a ticket/losing my license.  If someone is a violent criminal who literally doesn't care about punishment it sounds like prison is the best place for them. Those of us who can behave in society shouldn't have to be subjected to violent criminals.
There's no magical rehabilitation program that converts career criminals into law-abiding citizens with a strong sense of civic duty, even if you dump money into it like it's a black hole  Some people really are inherently bad and this is something that you can't quite solve with fiscal policy, even though it runs in opposition to your utopian ideals
It’s disappointing seeing how so many people think saying minor criminals shouldn’t be automatically locked away forever is “defending murderers”.  Should that child that shot his teacher be locked away forever as well?
You’re completely changing the argument here. You keep coming back to the punishment, which I never even mentioned. Sure, you take their ages into consideration when deciding a punishment, but that doesn’t change the fact that they committed murder, and fully developed brain or not, they know murder is wrong.
Well then let's just save some time and parole him now.  He's not gonna go shoot a 3rd person will he?  That would be crazy.  I'm sure he's learned his lesson this time.
Nobody, at least that i’ve seen, has said in this thread that they deserve the death penalty. Hell, i’m from DC and we haven’t had that since the 80s I believe.   Its like you made up your own strawman and just beating that point home repeatedly. You keep defending that they shouldn’t be locked up forever or killed and no one ever said otherwise.
> Just off the top I’m not sure on the facilitates in DC but let’s pretend they had enough(they do) in their discretionary budget to fund a correctional facility for young adults between 13-19 that is focused on Violent crimes. This would segregate them from the population but in actual practice actually have mental health , educators on staff with the goal of rehabilitation for their entire their at the facility.  They're called juvenile detention centers. They already do this. They're separated from the general population, they're provided care, counseling, education, etc. This is already a thing.  > Instead of cells that aren’t actually livable a model close to Sweden’s would do wonders to have human beings actually live and feel like humans instead of animals in a cage  Wonders how? Making cells that are generally better living conditions than not being in prison isn't a method for *deterring* crime.  > Restitution has to be paid to victims of any violent crime and I think the victim (Robinson in this case) and their family should have a say in how that restitution is paid whether is financial, time spent in this rehabilitation center, or something to show they’ve changed.  So the rich no longer have to pay for victim crimes? Restitution with a means of being served financially will only further widen the gap between economic statuses and how they're dealt with by the judicial system.
All you are saying is a bunch of stuff a politician says. The USA isn’t Sweden. It goes way deeper than just the prison type. I truly believe a lot of these kids by the time they get to this point are truly unable to be rehabilitated.
The context clue is the topic of the post. A person who committed murder and was convicted of that crime. Again, you are bringing up accidents in a post about a convicted murderer.  Do you have comprehension issues? Did your scout leader have no regard for the child’s life?
Great point, good thing the cops didn’t take out that uvalde shooter since he was innocent
They actually plead guilty to attempted armed robbery, so you’re gonna be very disappointed.
Im saying to use empathy. You’re the one equating sympathy with empathy.  You have absolutely no idea what you’re saying man.
People hear the story of "Grandma sentenced to 19 consecutive life sentences for having broken hearing aid" story and call for change, not realizing there's dozens of "man shot someone for money" stories they aren't hearing because it's boring.
The problem I have is with the vagueness of reform. Like what's the cut off point for "chances" before we can admit that someone is just a bad person and deserves to be in prison for a long time?  We have almost daily reports of career criminals with 10+ crimes going out and committing more crimes, rehabilitation obviously hasn't worked and more reforms seem unlikely to change them.  Does it suck that we may have to lock up young people for a long time? Sure, but I don't see how its good for anyone else to release them back into society if they just keep hurting innocent people...except for the criminals of course.
Yes, it's soft to allow someone who shot a person out on bail.
You do realize that this mechanism is already in place right? Judges have the power to review evidence and approve or deny bail. They should be denying bail for violent criminals when the evidence shows they committed the crime. In 2023 evidence is amazing, this isnt 100 years ago where evidence was word of mouth and unreliable eye witnesses.
Which directly supports the point they’re making.
Kam Chancellor won’t be in the HOF because his career was limited due to injuries. But for the duration of his career he played at a HOF level. Very talented, hard hitting, football knowledge. Glad to have seen him play
God I miss Kam  He was the heart and soul of that defense
God the LOB was so fun to watch
Man that head bob was nasty
First, it was Wilson to Willson.  After that, it was Cam to Kam!
Kam turned it on in the playoffs man. He was everything to that defense
I remember eating hot wings watching this game and I took a bite right before this play happened, I stood up and yelled and started choking lol.
can't get over how fast and explosive he is in this play. almost immediately after he gets the ball nobody is in the same area code as him
Kam pumping himself up after realizing he isn't being caught will never not put a smile on my face.  Bobby will always be my favorite member of the LOB defense, but Kam is a *very* close 2nd.
Kam was so damn fun to watch.
That's kind of a weird way of putting it.
A lot of people didn't really expect to see us coming in so hot after that 3-8-1 start. But we ended the season on a 4 game win streak to make the playoffs, demolished the Cardinals, came within feet of the Seahawks, win the next 14 regular season games, then another playoff run with dominant wins again over the Seahawks and Cardinals, and a Super Bowl appearance  And it was all on the backs of Cam and Kuechly
Cam VS The Seahawks:  2-7; 61% completion; 1,948 yards (average 216); 9 TD 7 INT; 6.99y/a; rate of 83
I miss Kam so much. The only jersey I ever bought was one of his
I would rather volunteer to get tased twice than take one hit from Kam Chancellor.

The iconic Cam to Kam connection
Kam is one of my all time favorites. I could watch his highlights all day long.  But DK woulda ran him down on that play.
Legion of Boom!
Oops
Man I miss Kam. He was the reason I became a Seahawks fan. Watching him fly around was just amazing. Credit to that entire defense but man, Kam was amazing.
I was at this game, ears where ringing for half an hour after this
I'll never forget that head bob at the end.
Cam didn't even try to run.
Kam was one of my favorite non-cowboys.  Seeing he and Zeke try to smoke each other was peak.
This is on my mount rushmore of favorite plays of all time
Probably miss this man more than anyone on the LOB.  Just a grade A stud and tone setter.
There are not 32 QBs better than Cam,  more like 36 or 37
Watched this at a bar in Texas.  Wife and I were sitting near some Panthers fans.  They were talking trash, got a little quieter at halftime because they were down, but still talking throughout the rest of the game.  Dead silent after Kam’s pick 6.  It was lovely.
Cam supposed to have all this speed. He might have been able to chase him down but he gave up right away. Reminds me of the Superbowl fumble he didn't even try to jump on. Dude had all the talent and no heart.
Kam was a big ole sum bitch. Him and Browning were a deadly duo.
All that talent and they only have 1 superbowl to show for it. A wasted dynasty .
Couldn't happen to a nicer QB.
89 yards\*
The disrespect
But how do these randoms keep getting jobs?
Dammit Cam
Wait he’s at the 20 … ohhh that way
u/savevideobot
Man that route…..that TE (Dickerson?) had no business being anywhere off the line of scrimmage
I see what you did there
At first I was like "damn what a play by Newton", and then realized the 2 players were on opposite sides..
HOF in my heart
Damn I miss Kam and that team. The Clink was always an insane asylum during the LOB era haha. Marshawn standing on the sideline with his fist up adds to the whole moment lol
Ain’t 32 guys better than him 😤😤
Don't make Cam put another list out, please.
Really led Kam so he could catch it at full speed. Perfect accuracy
he still has that nice zip to his passes! terrific!
Good times
Ahhhh yes, the ole throw late to the flats technique. Brilliant I say!
We played the Seahawks for several years in a row either in the regular season, post season, or both. They always had our number but it felt soo good when we were finally able to get the better of them
Cam gonna Kam
Best part is on the alternate angle you can see Marshawn on the sideline doing the hold my dick pose looking like a proud father
Carolina got clapped so hard this game lmao
90 yard bomb
This is a great play by Kam and a poor throw by Cam (especially poor play timing), but Ed Dickson really shit the bed on this play... I spent so much time screaming at my TV because of him trying to catch passes in the NFL. He is literally backing away from the ball as the pass comes to him and making himself as small as possible, giving Kam a WIDE OPEN lane to get to the pass first.  Kudos to Kam, he's an all time great.
Kam Chancellor and Bob Sanders are 2 players I wish I could've seen healthier. Absolutely did not get to see enough of them play.
This man was fucking INSANE at the position and had incredible cover skills for someone his size. We, and more importantly HE, got robbed.
You never know. Terrell Davis was elite for the years he played but his career was also short because of injuries. He's in the HOF
Don't know how those teams only won one SB. One of the best defenses of all time paired with a great QB and dominant RB on offense. Should have been a dynasty
Hawks had upwards of 4 potential HoF candidates. Sherman, Kam, ET, and Wagner.     I think Wagner is the only one who gets in due to the others injury or character issues.     ET could’ve gotten in had he not gone the way he did and kams from injury.     I think Sherman is borderline but unlikely to get in while Wagner should be a relatively easy in.     Props to Pete for managing the talent. People knock him but seeing how we had Sherman and ET on the same team for years….     Pete’s pretty good with larger or more difficult personalities.
> for the duration of his career he played at a HOF level  Usually you'd like to see a first team All-Pro or two as evidence of this kind of statement
Eh, I think even without injury he was more very good than HoF.  For my money (and I think most people's money) he was the third best player in his position group and fifth or sixth best player on his side of the ball.  Sherman, ET3, and Wagner are Hall of Famers.   Kam and Bennett were great players who were incredibly fun to watch, but were more of the team all time greats than league all time greats, imo.
He should have been named as SuperBowl MVP.
LOB 😢
I miss him too. He was probably the funniest non cowboys player to watch in the 10's. That time he hopped the snapped like three times before giving up on a field goal is ways a great memory.   I was also at the game he raised the 12th man flag Jr whatever y'all do. Love him.
He's got that Dawk in him
He was the Boom
I miss me too
I miss cam :(
As a packers fan who remembers watching a lot of those games, no they weren't
It will always be burned into my brain. The 20 yard separation, the look back, and then THE FUCKING HEAD BOB. TOUCHDOWN. Ugh.
Even as a Seahawks hater, I was hyped watching him run that back
This is actually the game before the most famous Wilson to Wilson throw (2 pt conversion in NFCCG)
To me what made that team what it was was Kam on defense and Marshawn on offense.
This was his best career game too. Nine solo tackles, two assists, pick six, nearly blocked a Gano field goal on two consecutive plays.
Did you die?
I mean, he gets the ball running in stride.  Everyone else is flat footed or running in the opposite direction.  Of course no one is going to be close to him.
On the flip side, this was the slowest developing 5 yard pass I've ever seen.  The WR turned around and then waited.
You guys only beat the cardinals because they were on their 3rd stringer. The 2014 panthers were awful. The tie against Cincinnati was probably the best non-loss out of division game they played that year.  Cam and Kuechly were the anchor for sure though. Not a surprise once the defense beefed up next year they went on a dominant run. Greg Olson should get credited too as the only reliable weapon on offense for Cam
Yeah but he hit Olsen in the end zone last minute IN Seattle so...fuck it
Seattle vs. Carolina games, were pretty much defensive struggles the entire time during the Cam and Wilson eras. The Seahawks came out on top most of the time, but they were always a fun struggle, was shaping up to be a real rivalry, but both teams kind of came apart at the seams after the Panthers were able to win a couple.
The worst loss was 2013 when we were knocking on the door to take the lead and DeAngelo (who never fumbles) fumbled in the redzone late in the fourth and that pretty much ended it.
Leaving out rushing stats? Classic r/nfl
Same. I ordered it during this game, I think right after this INT or after the second time he hopped the entire line to try blocking the FG.
in the balls
DK would have been on his sideline for that play??
And this man brought the boom like no other.

Kam might be the best tackler I’ve gotten to see play. He was so square and sound. I know he had monster hits but it felt like none of them were ever cheap or dirty. Everyone of them seemed like absolute train wrecks of mayhem. I hated him as an opponent but man was he fun to watch when we didn’t have to play him.
Also add Eric Berry to the list. If there is a football god, I think he didn't want EB to play. ACL, Cancer, then torn Achilles are all three potential career enders.
Bob Sanders is my nieces godfather. Dude is a solid brick.
What about Sean taylor
Terrell Davis was significantly more than just "elite" during the 3-year run that got him into the Hall of Fame though.
Second SB the entire secondary was banged up going into the game and once Avril went out Brady had too much time to tear us up. And then you know what happened. SBs are hard to win
Super Bowls are very very fucking hard to win. Don’t let the patriots warp your perspective
Winning "only" one superbowl is a huge deal. Just being competitive enough to have a chance at more than one is impressive
Change my mind, they were the best team in the league in 2012, 2013, 2014, and maybe 2015.  Probably should've gotten 2 titles in that stretch.   I think if you play the 2014 super bowl a zillion times they win more often than not. Jeremy Lane broke his ~~leg~~ arm on the Pats first drive, Brady attacked his replacement the rest of the game  2015 the difference in their Panthers divisional round loss was a bizarre Russell Wilson pick 6.
Choked the falcons game when we were young and choked the superbowl. Choked  GOAT dynasty status
I’d be shocked if Sherman didn’t get in. He was still an elite player in his 9th year, that should be enough longevity.
Cannot agree. Kam was the one who laid hits that set the tone for what everyone else on the field could do. The coolest head amongst the divas. I stomped my foot in irritation at the notion he won't make the HOF due to injuries. Such a tragedy.
That’s fair and I realize I have biases
The hell are you on about? There's a reason nobody likes Niner fans.
Kam sat out the first two games of... 2015? I think? The team was 0-2 and looked lost. He was the guy that told the LoB where to be and what to do. He was the man.
Very rarely is a defense so ridiculously athletic to the point where a 14-6 snoozefest is fun to watch.   LOB and \**gags*\* the 2015 Broncos were the two that come to mind in recent memory.
> That time he hopped the snapped like three times before giving up on a field goal is ways a great memory.  Same game as the INT in OP’s clip. I ordered my Kam jersey during that game and it’s still the only one I own.
He was also the Legion. Some say he was even the “of,” but how can this be? Kam Chancellor is of no person or thing reckonable by man’s devices. Whoever would seek out his history through what unraveling of loins and ledgerbooks must stand at last darkened and dumb at the shore of a void without terminus or origin and whatever science he might bring to bear upon the dusty primal matter blowing down out of the millennia will discover no trace of any ultimate atavistic egg by which to reckon his commencing.
Same
Geez guys, was just making a joke here
Stop. You just sound salty. The LoB was an amazing defense. Trust me it's way more fun as a fan to appreciate greatness, then just be jealous over something you have no control over.
Ol’ Dickfingers really came through for us when it mattered.
No but I almost died about three weeks later when a different play happened
even the closest guy who did flip around seemed to give up trying to chase after about 15 yards. extremely hard to chase someone, even if they may or may not be faster than you, with that kind of a lead
DK would have caught him
Reminds me a bit of DK chasing down Budda Baker. I wonder if DK coulda caught Kam...  https://youtu.be/J62GsevPwiQ
The team that went 15-1 in 2015 was almost the same team that finished off the 2014 season. We made very little changes to the roster between 2014 and 2015, aside from signing Oher, Ginn, and Coleman  The problem with our early 2014 failures was Rivera had several of our key players stuck in the doghouse, either because he prefers to play washed out vets over the better young players (such as Silatolu over Norwell) or because he was vindicative for no reason (such as JNo)
The comeback against Chicago was a lot better than that tie against Cincinnati
Cam also had 75 attempts for 296 yards (average 33) with 4.41y/a and 3 TDs against the Seahawks.
...and still ran him down.
My point was nobody from the Panthers offense tried to run him down after the interception. [Remember this?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ImdWvuzsCY)
That entire lob defense seemingly had 11 amazing tacklers for like the entire time they were good.
Watching Kam get flagged for hitting Vernon Davis cleanly but so hard it looked like he was trying to murder him is one of my NFL all-time highlights. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78qF72JwJwA
Eric Berry is especially sad because his resume is just a good season or 2 away from being HOF worthy :(
Bob Sanders: 50 career games in 8 years      Kam Chancellor: 109 career games in 8 years    JJ Watt: 151 games in 12 years. I don't think it's flair related.
And Russ’s rookie year the defense blew a ticket to the nfc championship.
Losing Lane hurt, too. That was a costly interception.
Didn’t Brandon Browner go down early in the SB vs the Pats. That really hurt the hawks
Hey, that’s our line!
idk, all you really have to do is draft a generationally talented qb and have him play under a top 10 all time head coach. i don’t get why every team doesn’t do that
2014 we were beat by injuries more than anything else for sure
> Change my mind  Seahawks had a 0.1% chance to win the 2014 NFC Championship game with 3 minutes left in the 4th quarter. It was a miracle they even made it to the Super Bowl.
They were the no. 1 DVOA team each of those 4 years  I'd say 1 SB is the "expected" outcome out of all that. Definitely could have been 0 SB's, definitely could have won multiple. Got the 1 though!
Im wondering if his current attempts at a media job are to help his image to get in as he’s kind of all over.     He’s also kind of been saying some stupid shit lately.     He’s HoF caliber I think but am hesitant to think he gets in right away and if not could be hard.      I just hope Bobby is a first ballot
His insane hits weren’t even the most important thing Kam brought to the table. He was the heart of the LOB. People forget he was defensive captain, constantly communicating assignments, getting people into position, and making adjustments. He didn’t ball hawk or shut down a third of the field like Sherm and ETIII did, but those guys played at a noticeably reduced level when Kam was out. My personal favorite Seahawk and still the only jersey I own.
It was insane. Games were even more entertaining because it felt like we were always on offence, and a huge game altering play could happen any moment. I was just as perked up when the D was on the field.   Lately watching our defence is just cringing behind a pillow hoping we can hold them to a field goal.
Personally, I don't think the 2015 Broncos defense was very fun to watch.
Yeah I read that as a “laughing at my own pain” kind of comment…must be a NFCN thing
You need a crying laughing emoji or an upside down smiley face to remove the salt from your words
>level 1AntSmith777 · 1 day ago SeahawksI remember eating hot wings watching this game and I took a bite right before this play h  :)))
Hmmm I thought Norman, Kaiwan Short and Lotuleilei were all picked up after 2014. I remember those 3 playing lights out in 2015.  Yea Rivera’s decision making has been…interesting. I remember sometime in 2014-2016 he benched Cam for his outfits iirc lol.  I’m a Washington fan so watching heinicke get benched last year for wentz was infuriating. I want him gone
Chicago was a choke artist team under Trestman that year. I don’t remember anyone on the bears’ defense except Kyle Fuller.   Cutler almost throwing for 4K yards was special tho
And now Seahawks couldn’t tackle a peewee player
You don't really get the full sense of how hard that hit was without the original broadcast.  https://youtu.be/XJeKxpHoEDM
Another good Kam hit is he when sent Demaryius Thomas back like 6 yards in the superbowl
It's funny for how dominant that defense was, they were awful at defending last minute field goal drives. Blew the 2012 Divisional against the Falcons, and should have blown the 2015 NFC Championship against the Packers if not for that stupid 2-pt conversion Russ pulled out of his ass.
Browner played for the Patriots that year…
No, your line is "Super Bowls are very hard to *reach*."
Dammit, I wish I'd thought of that. That's good
https://images.app.goo.gl/6ohG9ZnxgT4DfoyD9
He's my SB49 jersey. Bittersweet member of the collection.
Anytime a team was on third and long it felt like a guaranteed punt or turnover. What a defense that was.  Now when opponents have like 3rd and 10+ I'm like "aww fuck they're gonna def convert this."
How big of a pillow though?
The synapsis of the Bears season is cool and all, but we're talking about Panthers games aren't we?  The only thing special about the Bengals games was all the Panthers fans' social media posts of videos showing Vontaze Burfict twisting ankles. The NFL suspended him despite having no penalties in that game.
Like a bunch of sexy pandas out there
What happened to Pete's rugby tackle?
I always thought this [rain shadow image](https://images.daznservices.com/di/library/sporting_news/a1/9a/davis-chancellor-062617-getty-ftrjpg_a6ibokjbwvi41og7wvqbgoaqr.jpg?t=-447961484&quality=100) did a good job telling the story.
Good grief, would that throw be considered a hospital throw? Or are those only for ones over the middle
Or the second time he leveled Vernon Davis.
That falcons game made me hate prevent defense with a passion.
Jeremy Lane was injured.
Then who was playing the nickel that game? It changed  when he left and how the Pats played, Brady just chewed up the hawks when he went out.
Hang the banner!
Maybe I’m misremembering what I read, but I think for a stretch over the past couple years we were giving up 3rd and 7+ conversions at a higher rate than 3rd and short/medium. It’s been brutal.
No clue. I miss it for multiple reasons
Lane, who broke his arm after picking off Brady. Which made Tharold Simon come in and get bullied all game
My thoughts when I first watched this play years back:  1. Damn what a hit 2. Reggie got some guns lol
>Sheldon Brown breaks up the short pass.  Other things broken up in this clip: Reggie Bush.
I genuinely believe this hit is a big part of why Reggie never lived up to the hype.  It's like Rocky said, "he broke things in me aint never been fixed".
Bro had lost both his contacts on that play
Wonder if this will get flagged these days. No helmet contact at all but usually when a hit looks bad, the refs throw a flag.
That guy could really Layyy Theeeeeee Woooooooôôddddd
Hardest legal hit I've ever seen
Brees really did him dirty
That's a silly Hollywood way of looking at it.  Bush never lived up to the hype because the hype was insane. You cant just run around grown men in the NFL like in college. Regardless he had a fairly long and successful career.
It’s definitely not a penalty, but there’s always a chance on a play that happens so fast like this they throw a flag anyway.
Even though a lot of legal hits get flagged that are teetering on the line of unnecessary roughness I think he’s obviously too far from the head/neck area for it to be called today (unless it’s Jerome Boger).
If there's ever another DB named Woodson, 1st overall should just draft him without question
It was a different time but it’s still so fucked up. The announcers didn’t really even acknowledge it.
Damn rocked the shit out of him with a not clean and nasty hit.
Helmets are a dangerous weapon
Woody should be in the HOF.  He literally changed how safteys were drafted.
Yeah it’s weird how they just discussed whether he was “defenseless” by the way the rule is written and ignored that he just got his brain rattled in his skull. The guy looked dead
I believe this was the first season (2002) when leading with the helmet became a penalty, at the time a lot of people didn’t know what was and what wasn’t.
Shady’s running style with the ball out is an all time buttclencher
That’s also shadys season highlights
This uniform match up was so sexy
Everyone should watch this game if they haven’t seen it. It was a crazy shit show of fun. Except for us losing.
Shady Nasty’s ?
“That was sick!”  Something you don’t expect to hear an NFL announcer say
This one of those where the coach goes “Great play never ever do that again”
Teaching tape for now not to carry the football.  He got away with it too, it worked for him.
That was pretty brilliant by Kelce
That's some crazy real time field awareness
This was the game with the goal line fumble recovery td and Stafford actually outdueled Mahomes and lost. If anything, this game summarizes pre Campbell lions football.
This ain't the one where I trot down the field and look like I'm lost is it?
Shady runs with the ball like Nelly’s character on Longest Yard.   He so fast, he makes other people look…not so fast.
That Kelce is decent.
I honestly thought this was the start of a new wrinkle in the nfl but designed laterals are still only saved for desperate fourth quarter drives :(
When that play happened live, I had to go back and watch it like 5 times. It was so great to see.
Rugby!
God I just miss watching football so much.
Random question, but how does a play like this go down in stats books and fantasy? Does Kelce or McCoy get credit for the catch yds, or do they split it?
Huh.. if Kelce flips it without "establishing control" and Shady drops it here:  Is that an incomplete instead of a fumble?
And all rugby players are laughing hard...
Good thing he had the stick 'em on his gloves. Lol.
Love to see tigers and lions legends battle it out on the feild
I love this jersey combination. I already love that simple Blue/Gray Lions pattern anyway, and mixing it with the red/white of the Chiefs is even better.
lol the announcer going “THAT WAS SICK” is pretty great
It works until it doesn’t
I was so pissed when this happen, whole lotta things might’ve gone differently if we got this win, we were so close
What's crazy is his career fumble rate was crazy low despite having zero ball security in how he ran with it.  But then he signed with us and it all caught up to him and he fumbled like every third touch.
Garrett Wilson can sometimes carry the ball that way and it’s so frightening
I used to get anxiety watching him when I was younger
r/nonononoyes
Dude practically never fumbles, which is wild. I always just assumed it was part of his jukes.
that's why he's got beef with eric bieniemy lol
How frustrated would you be as a coach to have this dude straight up tell you "no" when it came to change his carrying ability
BIENEMI DON'T LIKE ME
He actually had another awesome run and a goal line TD that game.  But then yeah, that's it.
bring. it. back. plz.
I love that simple Blue/Gray Lions pattern, and it works even better with the Red/White of the Chiefs.
I'm glad the other team can have fun with losing. The only time I can say that was mnf against the rams
we got jobbed on that fumble return though
IT'S SHA DYNASTY!
[I was wondering where the private location was...](https://wp.usatodaysports.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/90/2015/07/shady.png)
Sounded very odd coming from Kevin Burkhardt
“Nice catch Hayes. Don’t ever fucking do it again.”
Most coaches, Andy Reid thinks to himself “that was pretty neat how can we work that in?”. Kelce has lateraled at least twice since then and I believe there’s been other plays where he’s had the option and didn’t do it.
From a naive standpoint, spontaneous laterals really look like something that should be practiced and built in as an option for plays that have routes in proximity;  the reward is huge.  But I suppose the risk outweighs the possible gain as any fumble is almost guaranteed to be recovered by the defenders.
Not in KC he didn't
Yeah I was not happy about the 99 TD return from the fumble :.(
Stafford fumbled at the 5 yard line too. And our guys were dropping and fumbling all over as well. Fumble football is definitely crazy and fun lol.  And we had Tyreek out and were starting Shady, was a weird day.
Entire game was genuinely batshit insane
The Patriots gave us a stunning reminder why this year.
Or first quarter if you're travis kelce and it's the afccg  https://youtu.be/RtBREAHJJEg
Kelce gets the reception and the yards gained when he caught it.  McCoy gets receiving yards for everything he ran for, but not reception.    Someone did a post recently about guys who have infinity yards/reception by gaining receiving yards after catching a lateral but never had an actual reception.
Kelce gets 1 catch for however many receiving yards he had when he pitched it. Shady get reception yards for every yard he gained past the point Travis pitched at. Mahomes gets 1 completion for the total yardage gained.
The lateral is a “football move”. Control was established with two feet down. If Shady dropped it, it would be a fumble.
When he was quicker than everyone it worked.
If you can’t touch him it doesn’t really matter how he holds the ball lol
> What's crazy is his career fumble rate was crazy low despite having zero ball security in how he ran with it.  I can't find the quote now but Shady has said before he runs that way on purpose to bait defenders into trying to knock the ball out.  It's like holding out a red cape for a bull.  The tape seems to support that because even though he carried the ball with one hand like a mad man, whenever he was actually about to get tackled he would tuck it real quick to secure the ball.  Even in this clip you can see him doing that.    Most importantly though, as you point you, his fumble rate was in fact low which combined with everything else is strong evidence this is a legit 4D chess move by Shady and not just him being a dumbass.  Proof is in the pudding.
He had it mastered while playing in Philly at least. Made me nervous as shit when he did it, but he made it work the vast majority of the time. I didn’t watch much of him when he was with the Bills so maybe a Bills fan can chime in because I wonder if it started to result in more fumbles once he reached Buffalo. Cause 2013-2014 was Shadys prime. Still very good in Buffalo for a little bit, but Shady was the 2nd best RB in the league during those two seasons behind Adrian Peterson.
I only remember him holding it like that on the designed pass, where he proceeded to drop it with no one near him, still gained 7 or so yards
Yes we did. As is tradition.
Ive seen it a bit more at the college level recently (and these things tend to trickle up football levels) but these kinds of plays should be used more often in two minute situations to get to the sideline. Teams tend to leave the middle of the field more open so its easier ti throw there but hard to get to the sideline, so if you can use a lateral to a player running the opposite direction across the field, you can get out of bounds in situations where a pass to the sideline isnt feasible.
Honestly I wasn’t either. Felt weird to score on a play like that.
I just remember that insane no look stafford threw to Kenny G. in the endzone, went through like 4 defenders. EDITED
We played like ass and the Lions got Reffed. Incredibly frustrating game to watch all around.
Walter Payton did the same thing although he fumbled more than modern running backs do
To some degree I don't really blame Shady for not liking Eric Bieniemy, because reportedly they tried to get him to stop doing this. After he'd already been doing it for 10 years.
Naw he was still a beast with us until the last year or so
One of the greatest passes I've ever watched. That was to Golladay tho
https://youtu.be/sfv2Bp1k3UU?t=101
Just your average Stafford Window
Huh? McCoy had 3 fumbles in KC on only 129 runs+receptions. That's 3x the fumble rate of his career up to that point. Can't blame EB for wanting him to have better ball security.
I'd be annoyed too if I was doing something a specific way intentionally for 10 years at a high level to great success and some asshat was like "we don't want you to do that anymore because it doesn't look professional"
Oh yeah, the Titans one was to jones.
That's why I said to some degree. I'm not surprised Shady wanted to keep doing what he's done his entire career. Kinda late for him to change up his style at that point.
From a stats perspective those numbers are basically meaningless.   I don't fault a coach for looking into it. I also don't fault a vet for being like - "this is what you paid for. Iv succeeded in the NFL for years doing this, BTFO"
If by "it doesn't look professional" you mean he fumbled the ball in KC at 3x the rate he had the rest of his career, then yes, that's exactly what it was.
It wasn't because it "doesn't look professional," it was because his fumble rate skyrocketed. His style clearly wasn't working for him anymore and he needed to change if he wanted to keep getting snaps.  It doesn't matter how successful anything used to be. If it quit working, it quit working.
If it makes sense for a coach to look into it, then it's def not meaningless. Putting the stats another way, McCoy was tied for 10th in RB fumbles that year with only 101 carries (tied with Zeke who had 301 carries). That's not ok, regardless of what worked for him in the past.  And "BTFO" only works when you're actually good. Doing it as a washed vet gets you 1 snap  over the last 5 games of the season (including a Super Bowl run).
I've noticed Kyler Murray does this too. I think when you are just faster than everyone else for most of your life, you just feel like you can get away with it. Once you start to slow down a little and guys catch you from behind, that's when you run into problems. Like I get his whole thing of using it as a distraction for defenders to try and punch out and make poor tackles but you can't see the guy coming from behind to pull the ball away in time.
I guess I should say... If you ran a statistical analysis the result would be that there was no evidence to conclude Shadys ability to prevent fumbles had diminished, with any degree of certainty.
Maybe. But if you think any coach is waiting for a p-value of at least 0.05 to before telling a guy who's fumbling more than ever to quit waving the ball out in the open when he runs, then you're out of your mind.   And the entire context is that someone said they understand why McCoy didn't like EB for trying to change the way he carried the ball. Literally any coach would have done that, statistical significance be damned.
You play a guaranteed 17 games in a season, maybe a couple more if you’re lucky. Statistical certainty is a luxury coaches don’t have. They knew Shady was on the wrong side of 30 and could see that he had lost a step. He started fumbling and it cost the Chiefs games, and they weren’t really in a position to risk it.
He's got a shitload of money and a ring.  Why not?  I'm surprised more great players don't retire before they're totally burnt out.  Keep your health and your money, you've got enough to live for the rest of your life and not want for more.
Okay.   But no benefit to announcing it 3 years in advance.  Maybe he changes his mind or gets crazy next contract offer etc.
✌️
Idk how thos affects Miami much. They clearly want a deep run in these next 2 years. Reek will be in his mid 30s by then and his foots been nagging him. Also playing the jets and bills defenses is gonna be a pain and very physical.
RemindMe! three years
I wish he'd retire now so the Dolphins won't kick our ass as much. I mean, he's already a lock for HOF.
Just hearing kittle talk about how battered his body is during the week on the Theo von show was awful to hear.   I can’t imagine going through a few years of that every day for five months.   They must seem to be in so much pain.   Tyreek seems to have a good idea.
I have a lot of respect for Andrew Luck walking away when he did. He was in his prime, but was at the point where he was beat up all the time. He was coming back from a major injury, and his last couple of years, he was constantly playing hurt. He just got tired of getting the shit beat out of him and the grind of rehabbing.  He made his money, and believed it wasn't worth trading his long-term health for an amount of money that honestly won't really make much of a difference in his quality of life.
Only other reason is ego. These guys wants to be HoF and remembered, that typically isn’t happening with a short career. Id personally have a hard time picking which way to go if I still have a few years of great production left.
TIL 31 is “mid 30s”
People overlook now how truly beat up Luck was in the end. He had massive internal injuries at one point too
Won't he be 32 or 33 then.   Either way, he'll probably be declining by then. The Miami deal either way was mostly to use him to develop tua and then get a run or 2 out of him.
Sounds like more of these running backs should start their own condiment companies in order to supplement their income.
It’s unfortunate that RBs make so little compared to others when they are beating their bodies up more than anyone else.
I'm kind of sad the running back position has downgraded in terms of value. It's a fun position to watch and used to be a big identity of your offense. But it seems like teams can get similar production with the next guy at a much cheaper price. Hopefully this is just a phase and superstar backs make a comeback someday.
Rbs are like the worst job in the NFL.  You take an absolute beating and nobody pays you and your career is insanely short compared to everyone else.
I was pretty surprised at how little his first extension was but that's just how rbs are now a days.      I'm curious if a team will try to trade for him. A lot of potentially good rbs on the market so now is not the most ideal year to seek out a trade.
>get paid as less as they do  -Jessie Morse, MD
Let me go ahead and preface this by saying I love Ekeler. Even have his jersey, was the first one I purchased when the Chargers got the new ones.  Austin Ekeler is a UDFA RB who just finished the third year of a four-year extension. Mike Williams is a first round WR who just signed an extension last offseason. Ekeler chose to take a four-year safety blanket extension in 2020 over a shorter deal to hit FA earlier to get that long-term commitment.  Also, the extension Ekeler signed in 2020 (4 yr, $24.5mil) would be the second biggest contract signed by a RB this off-season, only behind Miles Sanders (4 yr, $25.4mil). Three RBs are playing on the franchise tag instead of getting a long-term contract. It sucks for Ekeler, but this is just where the RB market is right now, and the Chargers shouldn't be expected to go wildly outside of the market to re-sign him.  EDIT: Oh, and regarding his point of Williams missing five games due to injury, even though Williams played five less games than Ekeler, Ekeler only played 31 more snaps than Williams over the course of the entire season. In 2021, when both played 16 games, Williams out-snapped Ekeler 896-731.
That’s nothing. If you really want to hear something that will piss you off, wait until you find out how my annual salary compares to Pat Mahomes’s.   Fucking outrageous is what it is.
Funny he mentions productivity because this dude makes a career of being a BS doctor, seeing only a handful of patients per day, and not taking insurance. (He has directly tried to justify this on Twitter, lmao)
A player's monetary value isn't based on their production, it's based on how much more likely that player is to create wins than the average player at the position. If there was a world of difference between the best long snapper in the NFL and the worst, that guy who is the best would be worth a lot of money. Right now GMs aren't seeing a huge skill gap in RB.
At the end of the day one is a WR and one is a RB. Williams makes more than every RB in the league so you can't really compare the two.  Although yes Ekeler should be getting more than just $6M/yr considering he's a RB that can catch passes.
Breaking: WR infinitely more valuable than RB.  Hard hitting news.
The market dictate that WR are more valuable than RB, just like the market dictates doctors are more valuable than janitors. Can’t be mad at what teams want to spend their money on.
I got paid a hell of a lot less than that and produced a lot more.
A 7th round rookie had almost 1K yards and was a big part of his team winning the super bowl.   Why would you ever pay a running back 7 million when you can pay a rookie 700k and get 80%+ the production on a 1/10th the cost?   Running back probably has the lowest learning curve of any position going from college to NFL, besides kicker. It’s just not worth it to get your money tied up in that position.
It’s because running backs are easily replaceable. Also catching checkdowns is easier than running routes.
Nobody made him sign that extension. He traded APY for the security of not having to play out another year and a tag.  He's also well within his rights to request a trade and it's also fine for the Chargers to say no
these QB's taking all the money.
Teams often carry twice as many WRs vs. RBs. WRs also have a far higher average height than RBs. WRs also have to have timing and route running with their QBs ( the most important position). The reality is the supply of talented WRs is far less than the supply of talented RBs.
96 starting Wr Are needed in the league, 32 starting RB needed in the league. Math will keep it this way forever.
People don't get paid based on productivity.  They get paid based on replacement value.  It's not that complicated.
Mommas don't let your children grow up to become RB's. It's just that simple folks.
Oh no, he's only made 21 million dollars. Should we start a gofundme so he doesn't starve?
How do people not understand this stupidly simple concept. Running back production is THE EASIEST TO REPLACE OF ANY POSITION IN FOOTBALL. We see guys like Austin Ekeler replace highly drafted running backs way more often than WR. Literally Austin Ekeler is himself evidence of why it makes no sense to draft running backs high (Melvin Gordon) or pay them lots of money after their rookie deal (also Melvin Gordon). Ekeler is obviously a touchdown machine right now but he should’ve balled out like 3 years earlier. If Teams overpaid RBs what incentive would they have to let guys like Austin Ekeler into the building to begin with.
Almost like they play completely different positions or something.... 🧐
This comparison is asinine.
And?
So? AJ Brown has produced less than Derrick Henry in terms of yardage, yet he’s the one that gets the nine-figure extension and what made our offense remotely productive.
Yeah that’s because good receivers are worth more than good RBs. Imagine that
Who the fuck is DrJesseMorse
If they're good enough, they're starting. If they're starting, they get beat up. If they get beat up, they're value goes down. The FO is afraid to get Shaun Alexander'ed. It's a shitty reality. Their rookie contract length should reflect the abuse they take.
They should institute a rule where if a RB has 50+ catches then they are bumped to WR pay for at least franchise tagging. Same with TEs.
Looks like Ekeler should change to WR, fuck the RB position for someone who can run routes and catch.
Maybe change running back contract so only half of it counts to cap or something. But I don't see why the nfl or owners would want that.   Nflpa would have to push it but then all the other positions might be annoyed.
Guys like Austin Ekeler are exactly why Austin Ekeler didn’t make that much. Also I can’t find any sympathy for a guy who’s made $21 mil
What's wrong with making 21 million dollars in 4 years?
Running backs went from being over valued to clearly under valued in a very short amount of time.
And they both have generational wealth. If you make it to a second contract, I wouldn't sweat it
NFLPA needs to work harder to get RB's paid. This is bullshit.
The collective bargaining and NFLPA are broken with respect to running backs.  I doubt the Players' Association will do anything about it because they need to focus on the majority of the players.  Is there any way running backs could leave the PA and form their own, separate union?  I think of teams like the Titans.  How many wins would they have had over the last few years without Henry?  In the first half of the 2010s the Vikings were similar.  How many times did Peterson carry the team on his back?   From a Seahawks perspective every dollar they paid Lynch was totally worth it.  2011 through 2014 would not have even been fun without him.  Beastquake is one of the most iconic plays in NFL history and validated a 7-9 team making the playoffs.  LoB was generational but the Seahawks wouldn't have gotten to SB48 without him.  I don't buy into the idea that you can just randomly plug in a late pick or FE and get the same quality as a top tier running back.
They also play different positions.
The nflpa doesn't give a shit about rookies, that's why they agreed to the rookie pay scale. That's more money for veterans.
What happened to the chargers passing game when Mike Williams was injured (which is often)?   The running game wouldnt really miss a beat if Ekler wasn’t playing.
Mike Williams is significantly more valuable than Austin ekeler
And professional athletes make more for one game than a teacher will make in 10 years. Welcome to capitalism.
Rookie deals should be 1 year with a 2nd year option fully guaranteed. RB hold outs should be the norm tbh, they are in their primes the minute they get drafted and it isn’t fair that teams can run them to the ground and discard after a few seasons.
I get why Eli didn’t want to play for them now
[removed]
No shit doctor
Production isn’t the question though, it’s value. If the Chargers had a worse RB their offense would’ve been impacted significantly less.
Sounds like Ekeler needs to punch his agent in the face.
Ok....but what is the Chargers record and offensive efficiency metrics when Williams misses time (or plays with a broken body) vs when Ekeler misses?   I love Ekeler, but the info in the OP is useless. Replacement value is what matters. I know sample size will be absurdly small, but just this past season, **the Chargers lost to the Raiders and almost lost to the hapless Cardinals with Williams out. They also nearly lost to the Falcons and lost to the 49ers....**
Running back is the least important offensive position in football.
Ekeler has become so overrated the past few years. People act like he’s a top 10 or even top 5 back, and he isn’t even top 15.
Inflation.
NFL needs to help defenses in the passing game without compromising safety, so the running game is more valuable. Maybe allow slightly more contact after five yards? Idk.
Jesse Morse has such a punchable face
You know how many nurses, doctors, firemen, etc Ekeler has made more than?   The market pays what the market pays. Most people would feel quite successful making 21million. I can't feel sorry for someone who has made more money than most people will ever come close to seeing. He became rich in 4 years. If that wasn't enough he should have become a receiver.
Nature of the business
Soon no one will want to play RB all RBs coming out of college will be terrible
Don’t play the position, if your a great athlete with elite speed and quickness play defense .
Ok doctor
This is nothing new though. Anyone aiming to be an RB in the NFL in the last decade only has themselves to blame for the path they've chosen. Sucks and it's not fair, but it's not some mystery that guys are falling into. It's been this way for quite a while.
Players originally signed as undrafted free agent rookies make less than 1st round draft picks in their careers. This isn't breaking news.       Hopefully Ekler gets a 2nd big contract but unfortunately with RBs sometimes they don't.
Smart parents don't let their kids play runningback.  If you're athletic, then hurry and switch to higher valued roles like WR, CB, LB, or even Punter.  Punters who played in the league for 15 years will make more than RBs now.
I'd pay guys like Ekler and Kamara good money because they both run and catch at a consistently higher level than an average back or bell cow. Throw Chubb in there just because I think he's the best RB in the league.  Also, someone made a comment that that RB rotations should be standard on every team like pitchers in MLB. I like that idea, but the entire rotation needs to be able to run inside and outside the tackles, all pass block, and all run routes and catch at a decent level.
Good thing I didn’t become a running back then
RBs should start a union within their union
Austin's Eke-lemon Pepper Sauce
soon theres gonna a union for RB only. A union in a union.
Bijan is ahead of the game with his Bijan Mustardson and he hasn't even been drafted lol
Shout out to Terrell Davis and his mile high salute sauce.
This obviously wouldn’t work for 98% of RBs but someone like Bijan: what are his options? Can he bypass the draft somehow and sign as an UDFA after a certain amount of time? The rookie contracts consume their prime so I’m curious to know what options they have if they want to bet on themselves.
Safety market always seems to be low as hell too for guys that play a ton and make a lot of tackles.
It's kind of a cyclical problem. Teams refuse to invest more than rookie contract or lower wages into 95% of the RBs in the league because they have extremely short shelf lives. Then the few that ball out enough to make higher wages break down because of the wear and tear. Then you have GMs reminding everyone not to pay RBs so you aren't wrapped up in an injured player.
The second half is the reason for the first half
There’s so many around, you’re probably a 1,000 yard rusher in Shanahans offense
Something in the next CBA needs to be done to address this. Idk what the solution is because it would be very hard to collectively bargain for it but teams do a lot better when they have good running backs but good running backs have a shelf life that isn’t much past rookie contracts let alone if they came from a run heavy school system that burned them out before the NFL. I feel for them because they are some of the best players on a team and are paid nothing and dumped very easily. What’ll happen to the nfl if great athletes stop playing running back because of this and start playing other positions as I’m sure happens already. Once Henry is gone will the nfl have another bell cow back that can last for years like he has or is he the last of the dying breed. Idk what the solution is for paying backs more and quicker but hopefully someone smarter then us on Reddit does something to help make up for the position being so demanding.
RBa should be incentivized by the number of carry’s they get per season because you’re right. It’s use and abuse when comparing contracts. Wideouts catch 100+ balls a season, only 66 for Keenan Allen (42nd in NFL) and Austin Ekeler had 204 carry’s last year (20th in NFL). This isn’t including all the blocking that goes on either.
imagine saying that someone making 21 million dollars in 4 years wasn't fortunate.
Plus, every team's goal is to run it 50% of the time..... They expect 50% of productivity to come from the rbs while they pay the qbs the big bucks lol
Offensive and defensive lineman team each other every play.  What you say is complete bs. Eckler might get hit 20x a game.  Nothing composted to lineman.
Brother, no.  Hopefully this is NOT a phase and they start rotating running backs like they rotate pitchers in the NFL so they are only playing 1/3rd the snaps or less.  If they'd rotate running backs so their bodies have time to heal we might get 5-10 years out of them.  What RBs need to do is start demanding an RB rotation the way there's a pitcher rotation.  Stop beating their bodies to death, let them heal.
I think it used to be if you were an absolute elite talent you didn't mind playing running back because it meant you had the most chances with the ball to express your skill and rack up stats.  I wonder how it's going to change when things really start going downhill in the RB market (we're not there yet, imo).  Are you going to see elite athletes just shy away from wanting to play it if they want to go pro?
Depends how you look at it. If you are a good to great RB you are a much more recognizable star than most other positions. Your highlights get plastered all over the internet. This means more sponsorships, tv deals, Jersey sales etc.   I’d wager most casual fans could name off a bunch of good to great RB’s on several teams before they could name off a bunch of good to great offensive lineman for example.  So a lot easier for them to make more money outside of just there contract.  Fantasy like it or no also helps with name recognition.   With most positions when you are elite you don’t really get talked about much. An elite CB might never get thrown at. An elite offensive lineman would never give up a sack. So there is simply nothing to talk about with these players.   An elite RB has their stats all over. Highlights of big plays and TD’s all over. Everyone knows who CMC, Saquon, Chubb, Derrick Henry, Zeke, Kamara etc because outside of being hurt you are going to see these guys mentioned or highlighted every single week. Makes it easy for these guys to make all kinds of extra money on sponsorship deals
They do all kinds of things on the field. Picking up blitzes, recovering fumbles, making tackles, never sliding to avoid contact, rarely step out of bounds. They do so many small things and it really takes a toll on the body.
Going exclusively off this tweet he has made $20M which is hardly nothing, and he is 5’8 which would make it difficult for him to play any other position in the sport.  It is a shame that even great RBs like this don’t get paid as much as some other positions, but let’s not act like he needs to go stand in line at the soup kitchen.
It didn't help they he was an UDFA. Sucks that's how the dice fell for him.
His per year is like half of Aaron Jones he’s underpaid even compared to other rb
it is also on him/his agent taking a 4 year deal. he could have bet on himself and asked for a two year deal with less guaranteed money. but he wanted to maximize his security at that time. If he was a free agent last March at age 27 I imagine someone would have ponied up and given him 3 years at $10-13M. Now a team has to trade for him and extend him beyond his age 28 season. that really cuts the market
More snaps and less production?
I might be wrong but I also remember when he signed that contract he really only had 1 year of production and made no money in his rookie deal so he was happy to take that deal at the time. I know hes out performing it now but when he signed that deal it was great for him
Snaps are a pretty bad way of capturing “availability” or whatever it is you’re trying to do.  not every snap is the same. By your logic, Justin tucker is probably the most overpaid player of all time
> Austin Ekeler is a UDFA RB who just finished the third year of a four-year extension. Mike Williams is a first round WR who just signed an extension last offseason  This is literally all that needed to be said.  This thread.should have been called "#7 pick makes more early in career than UFDA"
Yeah but you always fumble and get hurt and miss games n shit
I know this is a joke but there are old guys out there that get upset at how much athletes make.   I always ask them if they are at the absolute top person at their job. Are you the best chef/carpenter/car salesman on the entire earth? If you were truly the best at anything you should be getting “overpaid”
Tight ends seem to be the exception
But Ekeler was way better than most RBs in the league. Potentially #2 behind McCaffrey.
It's not even REALLY based on that either. It's based on what the team that needs them the most is willing to pay. And in this case, with wanting to keep consistency in the WR room with a new QB, we "overpaid" at the time to keep him - and then the WR market went absolutely nuts right after and it barely seems like an overpay now.
I think good receiving RBs are worth the money (if they can also handle the load). They become actual game changers
a good WR or mike williams?
And Chargers were sort of backed into a corner with Williams. They are in a playoff window and had already taken away one weapon from Herbert the year before in Hunter Henry. Meanwhile the 2021 offense does well and Williams in particular has a career season in a scheme that suits him very well. And without Williams they'd be depending on an older Allen or an unproven Palmer as their WR1/2. Neither were big play makers and a real mismatch for defenses.  From their perspective, to not keep Williams was a risk to their 2022 playoff and title odds plus even Herbert's development.  Personally think a franchise tag would've been a better move, but it is what it is and wouldn't have avoided WRs > RBs in salary for Ekeler.
If he didn't take that contract he wouldn't get a better one. RBs are dime a dozen.
When Mike Williams plays healthy he is game breaking.  Austin E is solid and great…being fed the ball. But he really isn’t a great runner and a back could easily achieve a lot of his production…in theory. We’ll see if that’s the case sooner rather than later I suppose.
That's the point..
Why? It's clearly demonstrating the difference in pay for skill position players.
The NFLPA represents all players, and all non-RBs love that their position group has more Cap to go around because the RB position group doesn't eat it. Salary Cap creates an unmitigated Zero-Sum Game for the players.  The only path that gains RBs more proportionate pay through a labor union is if the labor union were to fight against the Salary Cap, which is not likely to produce a result that either side is happy with. For one, that fight is an inevitable, bitter work stoppage. For two, the Cap, coupled with the Draft Structure and Rookie Wage Scale, is an extremely effective tool for competitive parity. As unfair as the Salary Cap is to players, I outright think 11-on-11 Top Level Football dies without it or some other mitigation, because I don't think the "poorer" teams can survive a world where the best Lineman get bought up.
The position is too watered down. You don’t get paid unless you stand out and very few of them do.
Rookie deals should take average length of careers into account by position.  A 5 year rookie deal for a first round QB is whatever. They can play 2 decades now potentially, with 10+ years as a backup journeyman even.  Running backs don't last as long, and even if they're drafted out of the first, 4 years is basically through most of their peak years. A 5th year and you're almost always better off just letting them walk, since they are almost pushing 30 at that point.   I feel like if RB rookie deals were 3 years, with a 4th year option, you'd at least see some more second contracts.
Very concerning how underpaid these multi millionaires are
Why? They get paid for the value they produce. It’s a free market, teams aren’t colluding to being down RB prices, they just simply aren’t valuable compared to other positions. Fans equate production with value when they aren’t the same thing.
I feel like RBs contracts should have incentives that don’t count towards the cap like a signing bonus, say you get 1K yards u get a 1M bonus to your contract
The NFLPA is getting their members killed with flex  Thursday Night games. They have a lot more problems than running back contracts.
That Todd Gurly , Devonta Freeman contracts was the RB bubble. Ever since no other RB has gotten payouts like that since
I think that's the point he's making here...
JJ Watt made more over his career than Ekeler and has nowhere near as many APY, smh
pretty average WR makes more than an elite receiving back.
How so?
>RB hold outs should be the norm tbh  RBs are the most replacable posdition in the NFL. Also NFL teams would cycle through RBs even faster. So nothing would change in the positive for RBs.
Production is production.
cool line mike williams up in the backfield
Really he needs to punch his former self in the face, I doubt his agent forced him to sign a longer deal
It could be that over the last 2 seasons he has over 3,000 yards and almost 40 touchdowns. You must be thinking of someone else
Salt and Ekeler
Nice.
This looks better than it sounds. Does not roll of the tongue nicely lol
This is starting to sound like set theory.
Yeah, pull out of the draft?  Is it an option to be a UDFA and go to the best choice for you?  I'm not sure.
>This obviously wouldn’t work for 98% of RBs but someone like Bijan: what are his options? Can he bypass the draft somehow and sign as an UDFA after a certain amount of time?   Essentially atleast as I understand it.... nothing.    1. You cant bypass the draft, you can delay going in by another year by refusing to sign a contract but... youll be in the draft the next year. Youd have to get to a point where noone would be willing to even draft you in the 7th.   2. Even if you made it to UDFA status, your only benefit is I think UDFA deals are 3 years and you get to FA 1 year earlier - but if you sat a year or two to do so thats null.   3. UDFA guarantees are capped. Each team gets like a 200k cap on signing bonuses for UDFAs and thats across their ENTIRE UDFA pool
If he balls out his rookie year, his only option is to hold out
Not if we have anything to say about it!
Well at least safeties can play for well into their 30s rbs fall off a cliff in their late 20s
Part of it is probably that older corners can transition to safety fairly easily because safety isn’t as reliant on pure speed
Tbf, that's a very short cycle too. The 2000s were the golden era for RBs. The 2010s treated them like lepers. Same with safeties. The rule changes again in 2014 really set that trend like a wildfire.
RB's need to be a protected class in the NFL, their rookie deals should be for 2 years with a 3rd year option, that way if you have a guy who balls out, he can get paid for his contribution and if a team wants to pay for a 4 or 5 year contract they know that they'll be getting a large portion of that in their prime. Imagine signing Derrick henry to 4 years 60 million, but you get him at 25 instead of 27
RBs should legit be hammering the NFLPA for better shit in the next CBA regarding them specifically.
I know and it sucks.
And also the fact that paying RBs just doesn’t translate to winning rings
It could be the opposite though.   If RBs were overpaid by a large amount you could also say “Well they are beating up their bodies more than anyone else so it’s hard to convince people to do it and so it comes with a big incentive.”
yet he still went out of his way to get an elite RB
> teams do a lot better when they have good running backs  This is not true.
A separate salary cap for RBs
The change needs to be scheme related, and it needs to start at the lower levels. Schemes need to switch to start having eight positionless skill guys rather than 5wrs and 3 rbs, or even go a step further and lump in TEs and make the number 11-12 positionless skill guys. You teach everyone how to receive a hand-off, catch a ball, run a route, throw a block, etc. You teach everyone every skill and then use them interchangeably to exploit matchups based on what they're good at. Then at the pro level you'll start having guys like Ekeler, CMC, Saquon, etc. With the skillset of a tyreek hill or deebo samuel. The biggest problem is that this requires good coaching and I think a lot of coaches are bad at coaching football.
For starters, the contracts need to be fully guaranteed.  I’d prefer ALL, but have to start somewhere.   Perhaps a per-carry stipend, not deducted from the cap would also be a nice way to supplement their income. Perhaps take it out of league dollars so the owners don’t bitch as much.
The shelf life argument is so dumb. RBs age the same as the rest of the NFL. Running is just valued significantly less than it was a decade ago with all the rule changes promoting passing offenses.
Length of rookie contracts should be tied to average length of career at that position.
> Plus, every team's goal is to run it 50% of the time  That's not true.   > They expect 50% of productivity to come from the rbs  Even if teams did run the ball 50% of the time, that wouldn't be true.   > while they pay the qbs the big bucks  Which is in no way surprising. Important roles that are hard to fill with a high level of performance get paid a lot more than those that are less important and easy to fill. It's as true in the NFL as it is at any company.
Most RB productivity comes from the O-Line though. Note that the difference in yards per carry between great backs and bad backs is usually within a couple tenths of a yard.
Yup I don’t give Mike McCarthy a lot of credit for his end of days in Green Bay but a great thing he did was not over work Aaron Jones. By keeping Jones with a second and even third back for his entire career Green Bay has gotten years of additional production from an electric playmaker. It even probably saved Jamaal Williams too now that he’s like the only running back in the league on a third contract, big reason why is he was never run into the ground for 250+ carries a season. I think teams need to do like San Francisco has done and just have a stable of 4-5 guys and just any given week one of them could be the guy that gets 20 touches and then he might not get 10 total for the next 4 weeks. Sucks for fantasy but it’ll keep the CMCs and Aaron Jones’ of the world fresh for longer careers and deeper into seasons.
They'll just get another RB that will grind tho. What RB is close to ad important as a legit ace pitcher? None that I can think of currently. Pitchers have way way more influence so they get treated better.
that would also mean that 1k yard seasons are dead, perhaps it'll be the next 20 win season for a pitcher, or 400 hitting season for a batter
We're going to see elite athletes shy away from football more and more for health reasons regardless
Yeah except there’s like 7 of those in the entire league
I think these guys would prefer that they get paid over name recognition and stardom. Austin Ekeler is one of those guys and it doesn't sound like hes making "all kinds of extra money" since he's complaining about how much he gets paid.
hell they can even play center in a pinch
No one’s acting like he needs to stand in line at the soup kitchen. Literally no one.
Thanks, Karen
You have to know that’s not the point.
Aaron Jones was also kind of overpaid, they valued keeping him and Dillon around for continuity for love more than they valued Cap efficiency
Underpaid compared to top contracts, but the way this off season went it feels like he’s more market value and high paid ones are over paid.
WR vs rb
Okay, Josh Jacobs had more yards from scrimmage than Davante Adams last year while playing over 200 snaps less. Would you pay Jacobs more than Adams?
Yeah but say that to teachers or any other lower paid “noble” profession and people will come out with pitchforks.  Reality is you get paid based on how easy you are to replace. Can’t replace Mahomes. Can’t easily replace Roger Goodell either thats why he gets paid so much.
And that’s partially because the guys at the top don’t seem too concerned by it. But more Importantly, the gap between top 3 and 3-10 is massive and then the rest is also pretty large.   So #6 gets a new contract, he gets paid like he’s #2, can’t argue to be the highest with such a large gap. Then it’s time for 1-3 and like every other reset deal, it’s just a few million. So it’s a slow crawl. There’s like 10-15 WR’s that have a case that with cap going up from the previous year that they should reset the market.
Not last year. Chargers don’t seem to think he was *way* better and or will be way better. And they’re probably right.
he's a good wr, no complaints.
Idk what that means
It’s exactly not the point lol, the tweet is trying to equate them as equals when WRs have a lot less competent talent vs the RBs which are a dime a dozen these days.   It’s simple supply and demand, not some nebulous force trying to hold RBs down.
If that’s the point so what? The market sets where money gets spent on what positions. Take a look around the other RBs contracts signed in the last two FA. Ek missed his chance to really get a bag like he would have when he signed the extension. Add on to the fact that nobody is going to spend any draft capital to trade for him then pay out something he isn’t disrespected by and odds are he plays on his current contract and hits FA getting what majority of other 29 yr old FA gets at his position. Life’s a bitch, he far exceeded his value to the point he may have been the best value in football outside of QBs on rookie deals.
Williams is more valuable than Ekeler.
Cool, now you made RBs even worse to draft.  Penalizing teams for picking the position you want to support is a weird take.
Rookie contracts milk their best years. RBs are beat up when the second contract comes around.
But then every position is gonna want that then it’s back to square 2
So in this world does Deebo take a pay cut or a pay raise against the current cap?
much better TD% than Ekeler or Williams though
Well Mike Will is certainly better than average
Simply the nature of his position. Ekeler is also not as valuable as people think they just see his volume numbers
they would get more guaranteed money. You can hypothetically replace Saquon/Jacobs/Cook but really you can’t. yes you can throw a guy in for less money but he isn’t going to be as productive. The stars need more guaranteed money for the short prime  essentially, this team doesn’t wanna pay me ? Give me the option to get that elsewhere. Some high powered teams are a star runner away from being unstoppable, so there is a market for the short term. They would cycle more, but they would be compensated for it
Nah, make Ekeler do it.  He's in the bottom end of the league in YPC, Rush Yards and Rush Yards per game.  But he's tied for second in Fumbles and Fumbles lost.  It's almost like fans of the team know their players value more than ransom redditors.
His average TD is 2.67 yards. All of his high receiving yards are because joe Lombardi decided to replace our run game with short passes and screen passes to ekeler. Hence why our rush attempts over the last 2 seasons are so low.
Maybe he should get into the arms manufacturing Ekeler & Koch
Here, this one's for your guy since I assume y'all won't be paying him a big contract either:  Pesto Pacheco Sauce
The eclectic players will change their legal names to operator symbols.
No. If this was possible all the top qb’s would’ve done this when it started so they could keep getting the ridiculous rookie contracts they used to get. Plus if there was a work around this easy to get a better contract + pick your team agents would’ve been all over this for top prospects day 1.
That’s not an option either. Players can’t sign contract extensions until after they’ve accumulated three years.
Ryan Neal?
This rarely happens tho. It can but it's not common at all. Even Champ Bailey tried it with the Saints and he just retired in preseason
So we just have to wait until HS and College players stop playing RB so the pool isn't as diluted.  RB's back again in 2040!
Ensuring that a RB will never get drafted before the 5th round.   This *may* help RBs get nice second contracts (I doubt it - I'd just burn 5th round picks every year vs sign a big contract), but it'll kill any chance of the life changing payday that comes with being a round 1/2 pick.
If Jon Robinson had tried to sign Derrick Henry to that contract after his 3rd year in the league he may have been instantly fired lol.
Not sure why the owners or majority of players would ever agree to that.
The second half is the reason for that, too. Paying a running back is a high cost with a very short term return. Unless the team coincidentally wins within a year or two of signing the deal, odds are it ain’t happening with the superstar running back on the big contract.
You could probably say that about any position though. Mahomes' contract hit of 17% was a record high for winning a super bowl this year. And that was only a cap hit of $36 million. I think a lot of these super bowl statistics are still a little out of wack because of Brady, now that he's gone we're going to see a lot of these "you can't win the super bowl doing X" rules break.
It's not hard to convince people to do it though, which is the other problem - there's a guy in the XFL or CFL who'll run into a wall for 50% as much production that you'll only have to pay $750k to.  The issue for RBs isn't that they aren't productive or that they decline too fast, it's that there's 150 guys competing for 64 jobs.
From a labor perspective, they absolutely should be paid the most.  From a football standpoint, they absolutely should not be paid the most, or even close to it.
*looks at 49ers with and without mccaffery*  Hmm
Idk. Look at the Giants. Barkley was finally healthy and suddenly Danny dimes didn’t look like a bust. CMC made people think Darnold was a serviceable QB then he got hurt and we were all reminded that no he’s not. Purdy was clearly overlooked in the draft but CMC on the 49ers made him look like a future star QB. Eddie Lacy physically dragged the 2013 packers into a position to be in the playoffs once Rodgers returned. I’m not saying good backs on their own make teams better but it’s a lot easier to be better as a team when your running back is above average.
If contracts were fully guaranteed, they'd just be shorter and smaller. How would that help?
Idk if you are a young fan or not. But take a look at Larry Johnson and Priest Holmes from the chiefs history in the early 2000s. They were absolutely dominate but the chiefs ran them into the ground and killed their careers. And that’s just your own team’s history. Even the best backs in history had extremely short primes with all but a few having less then 5 dominant seasons. The reason this is an issue now versus what it was in even the early 2000s is that while running backs today make roughly what they made 10 years ago, nearly every other position group has skyrocketed in contract size. Quarterback and running backs use to make roughly the same contract. And if the running back was good in college they would get selected high in the draft and make good money on the rookie contract. But now those rookie contracts are set amounts meaning the instant return value a running back on a rookie contract can give is far far far more valuable then nearly every other rookie contract because you are paying for the prime of a player at bargain rates. At the same time we have quarterbacks like Danny dimes making whatever it is 40 million a year but a running back like CMC who probably adds more wins to a team then Danny dimes does makes around 10million per year. Hell I love Allen Lazard but he just made 11 million a year and his only positive trait is he’s a good blocking wideout. I’ll be honest I’ve lost my train of thought it’s the end of my day and my adhd is going haywire and I totally forgot what I was trying to say and it felt dumb to erase this all so I instead added this dumb bit because I felt like something stupid should come of this.
SF does it because ours are always broken   Winning >>> extending some dudes career. Its just business.
> a great thing he did was not over work Aaron Jones  Wasn't that because he overly relied on Aaron Rodgers? I don't really remember much of those teams other than coming up short and bad defenses  He's kind of doing the same thing in Dallas, granted Zeke is a microcosm of what he was and MM didn't really have the option, but utilizing what skill he does still bring and splitting it with Pollard probably extends his shelf life, even though that's kind of been his whole career at this point with or without MM due to Zeke
Some, but not all. The chance to make millions playing a backyard game is still very enticing. Nothing wrong with making a few mil and retiring by 25 and then using that to fund another venture to make more money, or buy houses and cars or whatever.   Unless that elite athlete is tall enough to warrant interest from the NBA, or a good enough baseball player to end up on the Yankees or Red Sox, football is your best shot at millions, even as a backup.
And WRs get that same treatment
Eh even average RB’s are much more likely to be household names. Miles Sanders, Melvin Gordon, Austin Ekeler, Jamal Williams, Tony Pollard, Dalvin Cook, Aaron Jones, Leonard fournette etc etc.   Most fans would know all these names and probably be able to tell you what teams they were on. Because you see highlights or stats from them every week.   If you named off a bunch of above average players at other less sexy positions that have higher salaries to your typical casual fan they’d probably not have a clue outside of people on their team or maybe within their division.
If 10 million for one of the best at your position is overpaid then rb have a real problem lol
I'm aware that RB is less valuable. That's kind of what this entire discussion is about. He's nitpicking snap count and such, but the argument he's making at the end of his comment actually doesn't help his case.
I don't think it's ever been a discussion about paying RBs more than WRs if their production is higher. They can certainly be paid more than they are making in comparison to a WR that has lower production that's overpaid. I'd rather give a big contract to a stud RB vs a middling WR, even if average contracts by position aren't equal. Especially since a big RB contract is like a low tier WR contract.   If the RB had more receiving yards and was somehow a deep threat, then yeah pay him more. They serve different roles. Production is still important, but obviously we don't pay people per yard.
Um. What? By far his best season lmao. Plus he did get the #2 ranking and it’s honestly a toss-up that he didn’t get #1.  Like I love the dude, wouldn’t overpay for him, but saying his 22 season wasn’t his best performance by a LONG SHOT and arguably the #1 RB in the entire league is questionable?
Mike dubbs is overpaid
Mike Williams sucks and is also 14x better than any Pats receiver of the past few years
We can tell
I'd also argue that receivers "earn" their yards much more than running backs. Running the ball takes everyone on the field while receivers are out there 1 on 1
Ekeler is a better RB than Williams is a WR. There are less players better at RB than players better than Williams at WR.   I took the tweet as a comment that RBs are systematically shafted in today's NFL.
If that's the point then maybe something should change.
I guess we'll just have to disagree there.
They're already not valued in the draft. At least they'll get a shot at a bigger contract if they perform well. No one wants to give RBs a second contract, because they tend to fall off by the end of it. Shifting it back a year makes it more likely the rb is fully in his prime. Most rookies that perform well would probably rather have the shorter contract. At least give them the option and let them bet on themselves.
…and? QB’s give their best value early on paying for pennies compared to what they provide.   Also, we literally just had a system where teams paid contract value to rookies, and it was abolished because it was shit. And now people want to go back to that for some reason.
His numbers are definitely inflated due to 1 yard touchdowns & checkdowns all day, but it feels like there's overcompensation to where his value & production is getting underrated
He could call his marketing-for-my-sauce cooking show that
Good call.  I'll send him the requisite telegram!
Make it spicy and call it "pow-checo sauce"
Hehe, the most unfunny Key & Peele sketch!  I'm Σ from Missouri S&T.
Yeah, that makes sense.
And now I'm sad
Which makes Devin McCourty’s all pros at both positions even more impressive
Realistically it'll be another shift in schemes and the adjustments.  We're in the RBBC phase of schemes.
then there will be a guy who everyone will want so a team will take him in the 4th round to front run, and another team will trade up to take him late in the 3rd, and on it on it goes.   RB's are in this weird predicament where the impact they can have on a team is so disproportionate to what they make combined with history that so few of them do anything meaningful with their careers past 28. Safeties are also vastly underpaid for what they provide but at the very least they can make it through 1 contract into another smaller one and the elite ones can even make it till their 3rd, no RB has a second big contract.
comparatively at the time, because everyone else is so cheap, of course it's a terrible decision. I'm talking about it more in the confines that all of these guys would be free agents after their 3rd year. In Henry's case, you'd have a 24-year-old RB coming off a 1000 yard, 4.9 YPC, and 12 TD's with zero injury history
Ok, that’s a good point but seriously, when was the last time a team won a Super Bowl with a top 5 running back? Maybe the Seahawks with Lynch? I just don’t think it’s shown itself to be a necessary position to get a top guy in
Also there isn’t a huge difference between the #1 guy and the #100 guy compared to other positions.  For QB the difference is championship contender to winless, for example.
The same reason guys have boxed for a whole lot less over the years. If you’re desperate you might take any amount of abuse for a paycheck and hope of a better life. Similar to the military for a lot of people. Having seen a few inner city and rural schools in the US from an outside perspective I get why.  Especially when you’re young and you won’t feel the worst of it until you’re older.
Not even from a labor perspective. RBs are like the assembly line factory workers. Their output is 80-90% based on other factors, and theyre incredibly replaceable. QBs are the executives or tech department who have a skillset that is far less replaceable, far more central to the operation, more individual-skill based, and more difficult.
As a side note I do think it’s pretty funny how people used Shanahan as evidence that you don’t need to invest in RBs because the games best run designer was grabbin late rounders and udfas and turning them into productive players, but when Shanahan saw CMC was available he was like “gimme”
I can't tell if you are trying to say they were bad without him.  The 49ers running game was great without McCaffrey.
The Panthers started 1-5 then went 6-5 after trading CMC, so clearly McCaffrey was not their savior. His replacement actually ended up with even better yards per carry than himself.   The coaching change more likely salvaged Danny Dimes than Barkley.   Mixon was considered great but The Bengals were terrible until they got Burrow.  The Chargers have had one of the best backs for several seasons now, and they have still been mediocre despite a stud QB.  Josh Jacobs just had 1650 rushing yards and took his team to 6-11.  Browns just went 7-10 with one of the best backs.  Derrick Henry is probably the only back that has made a significant difference to his team winning the past few seasons.  RB rotations on small contracts have been similarly, or more efficient than the best backs for the past few years.
Priest Holmes didn't get to KC until he was 28. He shouldn't have even had a single good season in KC based on his age according to this sub lol. Then he broke his neck on a crazy play. Edgerrin James, LaDainian Tomlinson, Adrian Peterson, Frank Gore, Eddie George, Clinton Portis, Curtis Martin, Marshall Faulk, Steven Jackson, Warrick Dunn, etc all player well for over 5 seasons in just the 2000s. That's not looking at every other decade when RBs were consistently bell cows over committee backs with worse medical treatment and allowing dirtier hits.   But you can look at any position in the NFL, and there's very few players who dominate for more than 5 years. Look at some of the receiving leaders since 2010: Michael Thomas, Brandon Lloyd, Josh Gordon, TY Hilton, then if you factor in some pro bowlers and all-pros: Victor Cruz, Alshon Jeffrey, Mike Wallace, Juju Smith-Schuster, Dwayne Bowe, Johnny Knox, etc. There's more for them and notable guys like Maclin and Torrey Smith too. CBs notoriously have incredibly short windows at their peak. Asomugha played 4 great years, Sherman made 5 pro bowls and only played 6 full seasons, etc.   Very, very few players play great for more than 5 seasons. Only the truly elite accomplish that. Only the very good ones play at all for more than 5 years. The average player is still out of the league in 3 years.
Yes the 49ers have had a lot of injuries but they keep investing into the position too. I mean most teams would’ve been fine with mostert and like a udfa but the 49ers grabbed backs in back to back (Wilson and I’m blanking on the name mitchel?) drafts anyway and signed some random short term free agents (was burkheart on the team a couple years ago? Memory wants to say yes) and even with that they still traded to get cmc. I wouldn’t be totally surprised if they grabbed another back this year too. What I’m getting at is the 49ers make an effort to be deep at the position. Sure it probably started as a necessity when what was it like 3 years ago when every player on that team was injured but they’ve made sure that backfield runs 4-5 deep including the wideouts because they know it’s important for the overall team success when the offense can run the ball. I imagine whatever team signs Lamar and if they decide to go the run heavy route… the logical thing to do would be invest in a very deep backfield. The Eagles had it last year going 3 deep. I expect them to add another back to replace sanders (it was him that left yea? Man my memory is shot this morning) the pats have been doing the deep backfield thing for years now. I just think that’ll need to be the way of the future for teams and running backs… no primary guy, no second contract. Just draft a back every year and stay 3-4 deep on the roster at all times.
Not exactly. Aaron Jones rookie year MM used Ty Montgomery and Jamall Williams more because Aaron Jones couldn’t pass protect. His second year MM gave Aaron Jones more then 15 touches I think only 2-3 times. Williams and Jones were in a true 50/50 split even though it was clear Jones was another level above Williams. Then MLF came and he turned that 50/50 into a 75/25 and we drafted Dillion. Even still I don’t think jones has had more then 10 games with 20 touches over his career and because of that he’s approaching 30 with a lot less wear then one would expect of a 8 year pro. Especially one that’s had random leg injuries since he entered the league.
Lol what? You're clearly absolutely clueless about baseball, so I'm not even sure why you're pretending to understand what you're talking about.
This is the weirdest list of "average RB" I've ever seen
> Eh even average RB’s are much more likely to be household names  > Most fans would know all these names and probably be able to tell you what teams they were on. Because you see highlights or stats from them every week.  Its fantasy football, RBs are one of the most valued positions and FF has skyrocketed in terms of popularity, especially since sports betting has been legalized and mobilized.  The depth of WRs in FF is insane compared to like maybe 20 caliber starting RBs for the entire season. People that don't even watch football play FF now
Plus on a per snap basis the workload of a rb is gonna be higher. Not even just the punishment of getting tackled more often. They either get much harder blocking assignments or they get to run routes a lot of times after chipping someone so even the receiving assignments are more punishing on their body
Williams got his contract coming off a 76/1146/9 year, which put him at 12th most receiving yards in the league, far from "middling". And his per game numbers last year were basically in line with his contract year. Chargers don't sign him to what they did, there's a solid chance he gets the same or more on the open market.
Well that’s besides the point.  Would rather overpay an average receiver than pay a RB.
No arguments here
Well I thought you meant Mike Williams wasn’t good, but that is a weird thing to say because I just said WR, not good WR.  Sorta just assumed that was what you weren’t saying since Mike Williams is pretty good and even if he wasn’t, it’s not really relevant.
Why do you think Ekeler is paid less?   It’s because he doesn’t have the leverage Williams does. Again there’s not some conspiracy to screw RBs over - there is a larger, more tightly grouped pool of talent for RBs compared to WRs who drop off a cliff after the top 30-40 WRs in the league. Why is Alexander Mattisson a career backup despite putting up good numbers whenever he has to fill in for Dalvin Cook? Because you can find Isiah Pachecos and James Robinsons every single year in the draft or as UDFAs. You can’t find Mike Williamses hardly past the 3rd round in any given draft.
Why? RBs simply aren’t as valuable as WRs and that’s how it is. Fans equate value with production when they aren’t the same thing.   Plus these guys are all multi-millionaires so why anyone somos for them to make 5x the lifetime income average  in a single year instead of 4x is beyond me.
Eliminate the forward pass
Something has changed in the last ten years. RBs have been paid less. How many other positions in football have the franchise tag getting cheaper in the next few years? I love the position. It’s why I became a chargers fan rather than a 9er fan like my family is. Ek should go down as a top 3 RB in chargers history and I wish he got what he deserves.
While I can't comment on who actually is more valuable, a direct comparison of yardage between a RB and a WR doesn't answer that question due to the nature of how that production comes to be.  To think about this comparison with a simplified example, I'm quite confident that you can take basically a replacement level RB and have them achieve at least 3.0 ypc. Now 3.0 would be awful for an offense, the worst in the league, but the difference between that 3.0 and whatever Ekeler had is what he is getting paid for, not between that and 0 ypc. A portion of a RB's production is "easy" in the sense that receiving the hand off is basically a given on each rushing play.  So with his 204 carries, we could say that 612 of his rushing yards provided no value over expected. (I know that Ekeler performed very well in yards over expected, so I don't doubt that he is a good player)   Of course then a similar exercise would need to be done for the receiver in question, but I don't think adjustment will be as big as it for RBs.
So here's the problem.  You just turned every second or third round RB into a 4th or 5th.  Teams will view this position that is already the *most replaceable* and told them they have to replace them sooner.  All this does is lower the cost for the best RB in a draft (lower rounds make less money). So why would giving less guaranteed money to players on the only contract they could possibly sign help?  No team is taking any player in the second round knowing you have to pay them 4/3rds of any other position, have 1 fewer year, and is more likely than any other position to get outperformed by somebody that comes in as an UDFA.  Teams run RBs into the ground in 4 years.  You want to imagine a world where they only have to do it for 3?
He doesn’t deserve him. He doesn’t speak for all fans.
The disrespect is unreal
I'm listing stats, not giving an opinion.
Ooh that's good
Thanks...
It's a supply/demand issue. Lots of people have the body and skill to play RB at a high level, far fewer have the body and skill to be, say, a DE. You don't get paid based on your impact, you get paid based on your scarcity in the market.  Teams are already making the conscious choice to avoid RBs in round 1 because the ROI isn't there - 4 years of near Austin Ekeler money + a fifth year option that is almost always above market value. Now you're going to cut the ROI for that draft pick to only two years, and the years they lose are going to be (on average) the *better* two years.   If you are a GM, and your analytics people are *already* telling you WRs are way more important to your team than RBs when both are on 4 year deals, imagine what they will say when your choice is 4(+1) years of a WR on a rookie deal vs 2(+1) years of a RB on a rookie deal?
I used to work in one of those factories and I'd be interested to know what those executives were doing that was so irreplaceable other than hiring incompetent, inexperienced people to manage the line workers
Were Austin Ekeler so easily replaced I imagine the Chargers would’ve managed to handoff or throw to a few more people over the last 6 seasons.
Tbf the McCaffrey family are good friends with the Shanahans. Also, McCaffrey is good specifically because he is the best receiving back.
They literally became the best team in the league once McCaffery arrived.
We're getting close to a "formless offense" the way the Belichick had a "formless defense" - at least as close as you can get when the rules mandate 6 non-receivers, and 5-7 people on the line (while defense runs with 'there are no formation rules').  Is CMC a receiver?  An RB?  A blocker?  Is Deebo a WR, RB, or blocker?  Juice can be an RB, an FB, or a blocker.  Kittle can line up in odd spots.  We have Kittle, Juice, CMC, and Deebo on the field, make a substitution, and what happens is ANOTHER RB runs out.  What play are we calling anyway?    We're getting very good at confusing the hell out of the defense with some fairly simple playcalls executed a thousand different ways.
Okay? You've brought up 10 different players. I didn't know I was offering you my opinion on Williams contract, vs general opinion of paying a stud RB over an average WR. I don't care what the chargers do, who they pay, or how much. Your argument in your original comment did not help your case. Not sure what you want from me.
The game isn't written in stone, it's constantly changing. They could do things to add value back to the RB position. The NFL has made a ton of changes to make passing easier. Maybe it's time to help the run game out a bit.
Or there will be an influx of highly productive RBs on the open market that are early to mid 20s instead of mid to late 20s. People are more likely to sign a 24 year old rb than one closer to 30. The reason they get small contracts is because they can be so easily replaced by a rookie on a cheap deal. If the rookie deal lasts for a shorter amount of time, it's less of a bargain for the team vs paying their proven back.
is it a supply issue though? why doesn't every team have a 1000+ yard rusher? I understand its a complimentary piece - O-line, scheme, QB, etc... have a lot to do with a RB's sucess but there are guys who are clearly better than their counterparts, and have a significant impact when the ball is in their hands. The chargers tried to not use Ekkeler as much this year, realized they suck when he's not on the field and proceeded to put him out there all the time to move the offense more effectively, doesn't sound like a supply problem
Yeah in my experience the line workers are 10x more skilled than the executives.  You could remove the executive for months and nothing would change.  Remove a couple line workers that make half the executive's salary combined for a few months and that place is going up in flames.
God I hate the supervisors at my plant. As soon as we get an operator trained to the point where they are reliable they have to fuck with it creating a mess.   Like as soon as they see a reliable operator they think “oh I can move them over here and it will fixing the staffing and quality issues”   No you fucking nimwit, you moved the staffing issue somewhere else and created 2 areas with quality issues.
You mean once Purdy arrived? And the 49ers were one of the best teams the past few years as well. Also notice how the Panthers were terrible for several years while having McCaffrey. They were 1-5 with McCaffrey this year, then went 6-5 after trading him away.
Such as what. Also why on earth would they change a rule to make running backs more valuable due to some misplaced fan impression of production, that’s absurd.
But why would they pay them significantly more than they are being paid right now?  The issue isn't the years of use.  Harris only has 449 career rushes and just signed a 1/1.7M deal.  I think you're *really* overestimating how much age matters when it's really about usage.  And even then the core problem is that running backs are replaceable.  If you make each running back worth the same value/$ in the draft as a pick 30-60 below what they would be in the current system all you've done is taken the rookie money away and encouraged them to run them into the ground.  And if they get injured in those years there's a good chance that's it for them.  The running backs you are trying to help are already the ones that don't need help (they are signing second contracts, they are still in the league).  >If the rookie deal lasts for a shorter amount of time, it's less of a bargain for the team vs paying their proven back.  Again, your RB rookie deals are worth *less* than other positions.  If you hit a good CB in the second round you can play them for 4 years and then sign them to a new deal (or they walk, you still got an extra year vs a running back).  Why would I give up a year of control on a player that we already know is replaceable.  And if that means I'm now drafting rhamondre in the 5th or 6th instead of the 4th then that's a difference of ~600K (800 vs 200) in guaranteed money.  Finally, you might want to take a look at how supply and demand affect price.  We're already in a high supply low demand world for running backs.  And your change is to bump up the supply further?  Like some weird collective bargaining by position group instead of uisng the NFLPA?  I'm not even going to get into how impossible it would be to have the other positions in the NFLPA just be okay that RB rookie deals are 1 year shorter.
My opinion is that Ekeler is an incredible RB that I hope we keep, and that this post is moronic.  My opinion is also that if you read Chargers fans reactions to this whole saga, you'll find we're all in unison.  He's a good RB with flaws who is massively overvaluing himself and is forcing his way off of the team that took a chance on him and already offered him an extension.  It sucks, I hope he stays, but Reddit has rose tinted glasses on when it comes to him, because all they see are the TD numbers and don't contextualize them at all, as evidenced by this threads existence, where OP is trying to claim that he's more productive then our fucking WR1.  If you've watched half a quarter of Chargers games you'd know that statement is ludicrous.  But hey, maybe the guys who watch the team week and and week out don't know quite as well as folks who see us twice a season in primetime.
>why doesn’t every team have a 1000+ yard rusher?  Because teams pass more than they ever have, use multiple running backs as a rotation, and the rushing production is more reliant on other factors than the running backs themselves. There are probably 50 backs at least in the nfl that could reach 1000 yards on decent enough efficiency in the right circumstances.  When you see teams grab random guys off the waiver wire or practice squad to plug in and the next week they’re running for 100 yards, it’s a supply issue.
The executives i knew made decisions that ran off the few people worth having amongst their line workers and then would complain about having a turnover problem.
My plant managers moved me as a regular tech to "help" the quality inspector. He had a full time well paying job inspecting the parts but he was also super old. I basically just did his job for him thinking when he retired I was lined up to take that job since I was already doing it. When he did retire they brought in a dude off the street and told me to train him. I turned in my two week notice that day and found something else to do
McCaffery was there 5 weeks before Purdy started a game.  They went 5-0
Because passing has exploded because they changed the rules to delete pass defense from the game. All motivated by good things, but they should find a way to let defense play without compromising safety. There are a lot of options, like allowing more contact past five yards again.
If what you're saying is true, no RB would get a second contract right now, since the rookie deal is already 4 years. You're saying if the rookie deal was longer it would benefit the players, and yet you see them hold out for an extension.   RBs are replaceable because you can replace your older one for a rookie deal RB, and you've got him for 4 years if you hit on him. That's the bulk of his prime years.   If the rookie deal was shorter, you're not going to keep wasting a decent pick every couple years on a RB, when offering your last successful RB pick a decent contract is still overall pretty affordable.   If you think age isn't the deciding factor, this conversation will not be going anywhere. 30 is basically the end of the line for most RBs in this league. Shortening the rookie deal is the only way a good RB will get a better chance at a bigger deal (even if it'll never be equal to a WR).
> When you see teams grab random guys off the waiver wire or practice squad to plug in and the next week they’re running for 100 yards, it’s a supply issue.  and most of them can't pass block for shit, which is why they only put them in obvious run situations. The other half aren't very good route runners. Going back to my point that there are a lot of runners, there are not a lot of 3 down backs or backs with good hands and route running. Are you really gonna argue with me that Derrick Henry wasn't majorly responsible for at least a few wins a season between 2019-2021?
Please refer to the Panthers pre and post McCaffrey records. 1-5 with McCaffrey, 6-5 without. Donta Foreman had 0.1 less YPC than CMC did with the Panthers this year. Chubba Hubbard had 0.3 YPC more.
And they are gonna make a rule change to boost the salaries of the top 10 RBs in the league? Lmao.
>If what you're saying is true, no RB would get a second contract right now, since the rookie deal is already 4 years. You're saying if the rookie deal was longer it would benefit the players, and yet you see them hold out for an extension.  I'm not the one saying that RBs are even getting bad deal right now; you are.  I'm fully acknowledging they get deals.  But it's not for much.  >RBs are replaceable because you can replace your older one for a rookie deal RB, and you've got him for 4 years if you hit on him. That's the bulk of his prime years.  Yes, the total number of running backs remains the same, but now they enter the market a year sooner.  They are still going to get the deals they get right now (probably lower because rookies cost less now). You're increasing supply and demand is low.  This doesn't raise prices.  >If the rookie deal was shorter, you're not going to keep **wasting a decent pick** every couple years on a RB, when offering your last successful RB pick a decent contract is still overall pretty affordable.  Exactly, you turned current second day draftees into day 3s.  Nobody is going to waste a decent pick on a player that is replaceable and you get 1 less year of control.  Surely you don't think that having fewer years of control is worth *more* right?  >If you think age isn't the deciding factor, this conversation will not be going anywhere. 30 is basically the end of the line for most RBs in this league.  Age isn't the deciding factor.  Usage is.  Aaron Schatz showed that back in the 2000s (370 carries and 370 carries revisited).  Obviously younger RBs are more likely to be bellcow backs (because injuries to older backs that have been run into the ground), but you'll see dips in performance solely based off the usage the year prior and a bounce back afterwards.  A 25 year old running back with 900 carries and a 26 year old running back with 449 carries are worth much different amounts for a multi year deal.  30 is the end of the line for *almost every player in* the NFL. People get to the NFL when they are likely 21 or 22.  [Here's some stats on career length.](https://www.sportscasting.com/how-long-is-the-average-nfl-career/) Opening day rookie- 6 years, 3 games rostered in 3 seasons 7.1, first round draft pick 9.3, a pro bowl 11.7 years.  Most players are out of the league before they turn 28, regardless of position.  >Shortening the rookie deal is the only way a good RB will get a better chance at a bigger deal (even if it'll never be equal to a WR).  It's a great way to make the value of running backs tank even further.  Your heart's in the right place; it just doesn't line up with the reality of the NFL: RBs aren't worth less than other positions because they are bad at their job.  It's because the value over replacement is the smallest of any position and running the ball is negative EPA in most situations.  You'll score more points if you pass more - that's the issue you need to fix.
All you're showing is that RBs have a large impact on team performance.
No, obviously. But some of us prefer the game where running is more important. The OL will still be more important than the RB.
I love the idea you seem to have that teams would simply just pass on good RBs, and no team will have a need and pick them up anyways. That all teams will simply not use running backs rather than draft them if they need to extend them sooner.   RBs don't get paid because they're easily replaced for a new guy on a 4 year deal. Making it harder to replace them isn't going to make them higher paid than a WR, teams can still afford it. They simply don't because it's easy to get a new cheaper option to wear down.
Aren’t 32 guys better than me but I’ll back up Malik Willis  though
The Cammunist Manifesto
He really put Malik Willis in there like he’s the starter lol
Cam on Watson "I've grown to admire the person"   Wooooof
Absolutely devastated that he didn’t pick Kirk Cousins
1. Deshaun Watson  2. Lamar Jackson  3. Justin Fields  4. Tua Tagovailoa   5. Malik Willis  6. CJ Stroud  7. Bryce Young  8. Anthony Richardson  9. Jalen Hurts  10. Aaron Rodgers  11. Josh Allen  12. Sam Howell
Willing to back up Sam Howell but not Patty Mahomes. Idk what to do with this information.
But ain’t Malik Willis a backup? lol
“Unfortunately nobody knows what the manifesto says because it’s written in the barely recognizable Cam Newton signature deep fried font.”
Lol why is it a manifesto and not just a list 😂
He named every black QB in the league except for the best one lol  Edit: I forgot a few guys but the theme is there
He lost me at Deshaun Watson, and that was literally the first one he said.
Good fucking lord Cam, this hurts. Please just retire with dignity
Yea, except he used his trademark font thats a bitch to read and nobody knows the names of those QBs.  DĒŠHÅŪÑ ₩ÅTŠØÑ  ŁÅMÅR JÅÇKŠØÑ  JŪŠTÏÑ FÏĒŁDŠ  TŪÅ TÅGØVÅÏŁØÅ  MÅŁÏK ₩ÏŁŁÏŠ  ÇJ ŠTRØŪD  ßR¥ÇĒ ¥ØŪÑG  ÅÑTHØÑ¥ RÏÇHÅRDŠØÑ  JÅŁĒÑ HŪRTŠ  ÅÅRØÑ RØDGĒRŠ  JØŠH ÅŁŁĒÑ  ŠÅM HØ₩ĒŁŁ
Cam has gotten interest from 0/32 teams to even be on a practice squad what on earth has made him feel like he has standing to narrow his list to anything below any of the ~96 quarterbacks who do have jobs
Dumbass admiring Watson.
I wonder if Cam knows Tua isn't black?
Could Cam play in the USFL right now
Five best quarterbacks: Dylan, Dylan, Dylan, Dylan, and Dylan.

Seems like he has a type.
Luckily for Cam, I can't take anything he says while wearing that hat with a hole in the top for his dreads seriously, because if I could, I'd be pretty disgusted that the first thing he talked about was how much he admires Deshaun Watson as a person.
1. Deshaun Watson  "Aight imma head out."
I love cam for everything he’s done for the panthers but I think it really is time for him to call it quits. Will always be my all time favorite player I’ve watched, but it feels desperate at this point.
He’s being pretty choosy for a guy that doesn’t have a lot of leverage. Also, even if I had places I’d be okay being a backup, keep that to yourself and your agent.
Poor Deshaun Watson. Didn't know such a remarkable person was going through all of this turmoil.  Oh wait, THAT Deshaun Watson?
It was getting pretty cringe when he was only choosing the black guys… then it somehow got even more cringe when he randomly picked three white guys. Come on man
You can always tell how hard it’s is for athlete to come to terms with the fact that they aren’t they guy anymore. It’s definitely pretty humbling to go from “yea no one can stop me” to “damn I don’t have that juice anymore” it amazes me that confidence instilled in them from a very young age is still so unshakable even when the writing is on the wall that u can’t do what u used to do.
Learn what a manifesto is.
The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised
He’s putting this out there like NFL GM’s are begging to know what his plans are.
Patterns…
Bro couldn't throw a 5 yd pass when he was on Patriots.
List.  You can just say list.
Is Cam Newton more than a practice squad player right now?
Bring cam to the Bills, make em run for goalline TDs, save Allen.
Technically Cam is right. There aren't 32 guys better than him. There's alot more than 32 better than him
This guy is a fucking moron dude.
"There aren't 32 QBs better than me"  You're right, the number is probably way more at this point
TIL cam newton is a racist
Why the Fk is the Twitter logo a GD dog. Elon refuses to just be normal. I don’t miss having a Twitter account at all.

Homie complemented the person that Deshaun Watson is…he will destroy a locker room’s mojo. His personality is too big to be a backup. Their probably aren’t 32 guys better than him, but I wouldn’t want him as my backup and don’t think I’d take him with a rookie on my team; that “grooming” should be done by the creator of that team’s system.   Also, these are all guys that could be benched for him. He doesn’t want to back up anyone, he is hoping they will get benched and he will play and take over the team. That shouldn’t be the mentality of the backup.   If he isn’t a starter, he’d be dangerous to a starting QB’s relationship to the rest of the team.
Dude really said he admires the person Watson is. I somehow get the feeling that if Watson were a white guy he would be singing a much different tune.
If **any** white QB had a list like this, where the top 9 players were white QB's, and the last 3 were token black players... we all know he'd be getting called out right now!
Dude wants to go to the panthers AGAIN
That's a pretty dark list
Hi. I’m black and I only want to work with other black people - the same thing white people said in the 1920s
"I know there's not 32 guys better than me"   I'm mashing the X button to doubt.
I hope your cigar bar and whatever else you invested in are doing well.
Yo fuck Cam Newton with that Deshaun shit.
I know he's buddies with Josh but man I'm not enthused with having Kyle Allen as our backup. I would much rather have Cam.
Thanks but we’re good buddy
Mr. Backup Choices
That pic looks like a manifesto for his plan to kill the Batman
Does a cut a hole in the hat for his hair to go through?
Dude needs to keep his ego in check… he’s no better than a practice squad player at the moment
Cam Newton is broke
Cam tries to speak like someone with intelligence, but all of the things he says confirms he's a fucking idiot.  Time for this clown to stfu.
I thought stealing computers from UF would be this guy’s dumbest period, turns out it’s never too late to raise the bar.
Stopped taking him seriously when he started with a puff piece on Watson.
He spoke about how much he respects the person thag Deshaun Watson is. Wow
Racist
Should’ve put Jimmy G at the top of the list
He needs to go back up josh Allen. He's the white cam. And put a few plays in qith them together.....ILL BUST
Since cam started the list with like only African American QBs, Patrick Mahomes is African American and arguably the #1 QB for the next five years and didn’t make the list. And I get it - KC just won the Super Bowl so I hope common sense to him is ain’t no way in hell is he remotely near Pat, but Jesus Christ man we all know he’s off his rocker.
No one surprised by the Watson take. But definitely surprised at the Malik Willis take lol
Cam we all remember how dog$HIT you were on the Patriots and the Panthers. You haven't been relevant for 5 years.
File this under nobody has gave a F&$k for 5 years
Lol no one cares, dude is done.
100% wouldn't want this guy on my team.
What a clown
When your first point is that you’ve grown to admire Watson, you’ve already lost all credibility.  Everyone that watched the video is now dumber, and may God have mercy on your soul.
Gentleman this is democracy manifest.
Time is undefeated Cam.
This is beyond sad. Dude used to be an absolute stud and will still go down as one of the best college players of all time, but you gotta let this dream go at this point, it's so cringe and hard to watch
Remember when people actually got shit on for thinking this guy was an asshole
If only the Chinese would start a football league because the NFL needs to be able to ship morons half way around the world like the NBA does
Cam out here unifying Bengals and Chiefs fans
This dude look like a Batman villain.
This dude is, and always has been, a clown.
Guys, we are all rooting for Cam in Cleveland, right? We all want to hear his name chanted every single time Watson throws an incompletion, right? We want a Cam Newton "I should be starting over a rapist." right?   Can Cleveland be on Hard Knocks again?
He’s a clown and he sucks.
Tell me you're a narcissist without telling me you're a narcissist
Not one white QB 😂
If you’re capable of being an nfl starting qb, you will be an nfl starting qb
Says he admires Deshaun Watson as a person  Willing to be Titans QB3  Sam Howell jump scare   This video has everything, man.
His shoulder is still made of used pinball parts and half eaten prosciutto
It's very weird titling this as a manifesto. It is not the correct usage at all.
The only issue I see here is that none of these guys are in the USFL.  Which is probably your only option Cam
First of all hilarious he went on so long about Watson and then I laughed when he referred to mentoring rookie QBs as “grooming them” 🤣 then the outfit.  I legit thought he was only going to list black QBs and end it with Rodgers too lmao.  I think cam would be a good mentor/back up for one of the rookie teams though if he was realistic about what he’s worth.  Great video though
Cam on the bears wouldn’t be terrible to give jf1 a break in small yardage goal line situations
Weirdest use of ‘manifesto’ in awhile.
Second hand embarrassment.
My man admires Deshaun Watson. Better don't put that in your resumee.  Also did my man just say he's better than Pat Mahomes?
Within less than 2 minutes, he has done the following: deshaun watson at the top of his list, says he admires Watson, and says he wants to groom young quarterbacks.  his agent out there telling him no no no what are you doing cam?
LoL. So its a black thing. Cool Cam. Cool cool cool.   Shit is lame as fuck. He's lame, with his stupid ass hats. Fucks with rapists before white people, lol man.
"I've grown to admire [Deshaun Watson]"  Fumble!
It's sad watching some of these guys desperately cling to football when the NFL is obviously done with them. Dez Bryant and TO come to mind as well.
Why am I not surprised Watson is #1
That's not a manifesto, Robert Griffin
What a choad
What makes this a “manifesto” as opposed to just a “list”?
He has the confidence of a man who dives for loose fumbles in the Super Bowl.
desperation is a stinky cologne.
So... Cool with a rapist and thinks a bunch rookies are better than current starters?  Ya, I think Cam can fuck off.  Oh remember that time he shit on a lady reporter because he couldn't make a read? Yeah, I see a pattern.  He can fuck off.
All I could think about was when the Monarch went on a rant about "the short list of men I consider my peers" during his murder trial
His list should be all 32 in no particular order.
Really glad we thumped this guy in SB50
If you needed any more evidence that cam’s career is over, here it is.  Von Miller really ended that dude.
Thank you Cam, very cool!
>DeShaun, Lamar, Tua, Malik   He’s picking guys he can take over for lol
Wtf
"In regards to"  No
Alright Cam, hear me out. There’s just one guy you can legitimately back up at this point and it’s Taysom Hill. He’s the only change of pace/short yardage/goal line qb in the league and that’s what you are now. I appreciate the offer to be your agent but I respectfully decline. Best of luck
It's so funny to hear Cam Newton talk about being an NFL quarterback.
He actually tried to defend Watson 🤦🏼‍♂️ 💀
Cam…you’re really going to start by saying you have come to appreciate the person Deshaun Watson is.    I love this dude, but he says the dumbest things.
Good idea let's alienate yourself from any teams that might have considered you. All while showing support to a sexual predator and making a list that may be interrupted as racist. Don't forget to dress up like an entity from an episode of sleep paralysis and smoke some tobacco on camera.   This is why some of these egomaniacs need agents and PR teams.   "I have reconsidered my approach in looking for an opportunity to play in the NFL. I still believe I am good enough to start for one of the 32 teams, but I also realize that I can be a valuable asset and mentor as a backup quarterback at this stage of my career. My goal is to continue to play football and win championships in any role the team calls on me for."
"I admire Deshaun Watson" Well then...
Yeah he admires deshaun Watson, but don't worry because he also wants to groom young qbs
 Bro….he named damn near only black QBs. Why would a team want a glimpse into the future by putting him on their roster. He could get hurt the same way. Only guys I don’t see getting hurt are Rodgers, Allen, and Howell. He’s hoping Hurts, LamaRB, Tua, Young, Stroud, or Richardson get hurt and he can get some playing time or the three young guys will be busts which is likely especially for Richardson. He could steal a job from Fields because he’s trash, Willis(who is 3rd strong so what’s the point?), and Watson because of his pathetic play as of late.
I would think backing up Mahomes would be a great situation for Cam because you’d probably win a ring, would probably get some garbage time reps, and I’d bet Reid could utilize Cam for his running abilities on certain plays. Cam’s arm might be shot but he proved he can still run. But apparently Cam don’t want that.
Cam at this point would be lucky to get a QB3 spot on an nfl roster. I’ll probably get downvotes for saying this, but everyone he listed was black or Hawaiian lol. That’s not by coincidence, not that it matters but this man really just said the “only” QB’s he’d be willing to back up in the league are some stars including a serial rapist, some decent players, unproven rookies, and Willis who is probably the only qb worse than Zach Wilson in the league.
I tell you what, I will one up him.  I will agree to sign in the NFL as backup QB for any team out there.  I am not picky like Cam.  Give me a call.
Why does anybody care what this has been has to say. He’s been irrelevant for years.  He should back up Colin Kaepernick.
Not going to lie definitely said “wait Aaron’s black?”
sad when you see someone’s skill deteriorate but they still think they are still superstar level… sirrr you are NOT that guy anymore it’s done lol
As a person that also won't be playing in the NFL, I too am going to release a manifesto of Players I'm willing to play backup for.
Ain’t no way lmao
He might want to make a version for the CFL teams.
Very telling that he doesn’t think he can beat out Malik Willis
😆 He’s kidding, right?  Right?
Let it go Cam. You had a great career and made a ton of money. Retire with dignity instead of saying you'll back up Malik Willis
Cam Newton sucks, he isn't even a good backup.   A good backup is someone who knows they are a backup, can teach and help regardless if they are playing. Someone who leaves their ego at the door.
Just hang ‘em up, Cam. You’re done. This is just sad.
The real question is there a hole in the top of his hat for his hair like that and If so did he cut it himself or does it come like that?
cam could actually be pretty good for bryce having a vet help u transition into the league is a huge advantage
Is he still trying to play as a Vegan?
This dude is so irrelevant he’s begging for a backup job
This guy just needs to stop...
Hahaha just learned that basically Can Newton beliefs he is better than Patty Mahomes
The guy is already broke?
I also make demands of the people that refuse to hire me
When the ego is the last thing to realize you’re washed up.
If you have to put out a list for people to back up you’re not back up material lmao maybe 3rd stringer or practice squad for you bud
Doesn't want to ride the bench behind 15? /s  Looks like he wants to help some of those players out for real. Hope he lands in a team.
This is sad. LOL
and not a single team cared
Cam thinks he's Brady/Rodgers/Manning.    Ain't nobody want you homey, take them bum knees back to the couch.
Man don’t nobody give a fuck!
List of teams willing to take him on as even a backup:
Bro must think he’s better than Burrow, Goff, Rodgers, Dak, prime Kirk, Stafford and Russ I guess.
I don't think people understand the job of a back up qb. Is Cam Newton better at football than most backups, yes. Is Cam Newton gonna be proficient in knowing a playbook and helping the starter prepare beforehand or adjust during games? The backup is basically another qb coach, and as incredibly talented Cam was, nobody's thinking about him as a future oc.
Incredible how he nukes any level of good will I've ever held for him in the first 30 seconds.
Bro really starts off the list with Watson, talks about how he admires him, and then tries to bring up he controversy by saying “thats behind him” and then a very obvious cut to him moving on.   He also mentions 3 rookies he would like to “groom”. First, choose a different word. Second, after the past few years I don’t think many teams will be comfortable with handing that responsibility to you.   Finally, as a Chargers fan, I can confidently say we are perfectly happy with the fact that you aren’t willing to backup Herbie, we would rather keep Easton Stick anyway. I’m sure there are many other teams whose QBs aren’t on this list who would have something similar to say  Just a boneheaded video from beginning to end
oh no you people aren't going to like this
First off, call me a homer but I really do believe Cam when he says that there aren't 32 QBs in the league that are better than him. I sincerely believe that he had a string of bad luck with injuries from 2017 to 2019 and catching covid in 2020, and that he could return to playing at a high level if given the opportunity. Him not getting signed in 2022 in my mind is down to 2 reasons.   1. His recent tape was bad. But he was thrown in the deep end with no time to prepare on the Panthers in 2021, and was actually playing pretty well on the Pats in 2020 before he got sick.  2. His status as a former MVP and his whole larger than life persona led some teams to not want to bring him into a locker room as a backup as it might have led to a QB controversy.  All that being said - publicly announcing which QBs you would backup? And naming Deshaun Watson the rapist as first on that list?! That's just embarrassing.   I hope the Colts draft Anthony Richardson and sign Cam to mentor him for a season. Short of that though, the dude has to realize that - fair or not - the league has retired him.
Should Identify as trans, and go play in the lingerie league, id watch that
I know it makes no sense to have 3 QBs on the roster, but I’d love just having Cam’s presence back on the team. Could be like Udonis on the Heat, lol.
Welcome back :’)
Raping 22 women doesn't just "go behind him"
Watson makes sense. He looked like shit last year. Was it rust? Maybe. I think Watson will have a short leash. Browns fans are not going to support a sexual assaulter who can't score TDs. He'll lose the team pretty fast if the Browns get off to a bad start.
He wants to back up Josh Allen to get that Super Bowl ring next year 😈
Sorry fuck that, Watson is not a good guy, that shit isn't behind him, fuck that dude.  Also, we just not gonna talk about this dude's hair coming out the top of his pimp hat?
First guy on the list is Watson....nope keep him out!
Smart on the field, dumb off the field.   Why would a team, any team, bring you in when you say there aren't 32 players better than you? The first bad game their QB has they have to worry about you starting controversy in the locker room. Going to other players saying "i should be starting". Dividing the team.  He doesn't know it, but he ended his career when he said 'there aren't 32 QBs better than me". That was it, that was the moment he retired. He just didn't realize it.
Ohhh I like Cam - It was sad how fast he fell to the bottom  >Deshaun Watson  Oh nevermind. lol Go fuck your self Cam, keep failing
I fucking hate reddit. Instead of comments about NFL discussion or the possibilities of who he'll play for, it's all a bunch of dorks laughing at their own jokes
seems like all nfl players love deshaun. when will y'all get off his back? every-time deshaun is mentioned, all the same old comments get brought up again.
Cam is still a top 20 guy. He should start somewhere.
Y’all hate Cam for no reason bro y’all so white lmao
Ehh, guess I wouldn’t mind cam being back up to Tua. Couldn’t be worse than Bridgewater last season right? Teddy two gloves was injured more than Tua last season for Christ sakes
Manifest Destiny
Surprised no Mahomes
I just think no team is going to sign him!!
Admires the person Deshaun is 💀
Geno didn’t make Newtons list. I don’t know how this makes me feel.
He didn’t list Lance/Purdy because he knows he would eventually have to go in and get hurt just like them. The curse is real.
This is like me applying for jobs that would accept and I’m not even qualified for McDonald’s
That's nice.
Sam Howell > Mahomes confirmed
Cams personality is too big to be a back up. That’s why he doesn’t have a job right now. Not saying that it’s right just saying what I think GMs think.
Aka teams that could win a superbowl or teams with qbs that he thinks suck
For some reason I expected the last 3 names to be Dak, Kyler, and Geno instead
Number one has got to be Tua
Maybe the best video on Twitter 💀
The most offensive part is assuming Malik Willis will be a starter
No one gonna talk about how he looks like the bad guy from Princess and the Frog?
What he said about Watson is just disgusting.
….is he saying that he is better than the people that aren’t on the list?! i.e Patrick Mahommes and Joe Burrow?!
First of all, lmfao at the background   Secondly, no way this man said Deshaun first. Cam bby what is you doin
Thank god it was a list of QBs he’d back up…I read “Cam Newton puts out a manifesto of the QBs…” and thought this man put out a list of QBs he thinks are worse than him yet on a roster lol
No love for Jared Goff huh?
1- Deshaun Watson: "I've grown to admire the person.."  And... end video.
I could see him as 1st string backup on 6 of the 10 teams he listed here.
#1 Deshaun Watson ….. What in the actual fuck?
Shouldn’t the answer be all 32 teams?
I'm surprised he didn't say Tom Brady /s
SHOW ME THE MONEEEEEEEYYYYYY
Surprised he didnt choose The Lions/Goff — perhaps because the Lions offense does not align to his running style & the Lions used him for Aprils Fool?
He named every QB situtation in which he could end up playing because of injury or bad play
How do you guys get to put your favorite team or player under your usernames?
Why is he dressed like Teddy Roosevelt tho?
Yo, Mayor McCheese called and asked if he can get his suit back.
This list is either guys that he feels like he can learn from, or outright beat in a competition. The big guns he doesn’t mention (Mahomes), is because he’s jealous of those guys. Cam is all ego.
And by "QBs" he of course means "randoms"
Even his backdrop is that wonky-ass font he tweets with. My guy is committed to the brand, I guess…  Also did he cut a hole in that cowboy hat so his hair could stick out?
Deshaun Watson is not someone you should “admire” Cam 🤨
Dude needs to retire. He hasn’t been relevant in years
I thought he was trolling until he said Rodgers
Washington should look into it honestly because of the history with Rivera. Also they could use Cam in some short yardage situations or some special packages similar to how Baltimore and SF did with Lance and Lamar when they were backups.
Damn Cam. He was a fantastic man in New England and I loved every second of having the person here. He was bad as a QB, but that's more on Bill for hiring him. But genuinely seemed sweet at heart in the media and the community.  But I can't endorse a guy that admires the person *DeShaun Watson* has become. What the fuck
No word yet on how Patrick Mahomes is taking this latest emotional blow
This is fucking great thanks for posting. I would love to see the Deshaun Watson and Malik Willis situations play out
Might sound dumb but if cam can accept the backup role fully any mobile qb could use some of his football knowledge and pick things that will help them he was a elite talent for a couple years
I love Cam, but his outfits remind me of the Key and Peele OutKast sketch
Imagine if the Raiders sign him on the basis that he was also a Patriots QB.
Backup Watson, occasionally run behind our line and throw the ball 3 or four times on a truck play. What could go wrong… here in Cleveland….
Wtf? What is he doing?
he’d better stop playing and come to the XFL 😂 get more playtime
Manifesto
Lol he listed pretty much everyone that got hurt for longer than 1 week. He pretty much wants to "backup" and hope they get hurt again so he can be starter. He's got to prove himself that he's out of the league he had a few good seasons in mid 2010s couldn't bring it home when he had the chance.
The Newton Manifesto
:(
I thought Dalton played great for a bridge/backup/vet presence, but I wish we didn't sign him so there'd be a chance we bring Cam back. 🥲 Really, really hope to see him back somewhere in the league though, and will root for him wherever he goes (although that Watson comment was concerning, ngl...)
I read “Cam Newton” and “manifesto” and about shit myself
Lmfaooooo it's like he's specifically asking these teams to draft him cuz there's 0 consistency
Even though cam is washed, I still think he could be used on qb sneaks and short redzone plays because he is big bodied.
This guy is completely off his rocker
it's funny to hear Cam talk about being a backup
Was sz*
If you're backing up Malik Willis, something drastically went wrong.  And Josh Allen should have been #1
Does he not have an agent like Lamar? Why do this?
Great way to never get a backup job.
This dude is a clown
no kenny pickett :(
Shouldn’t it be every qb in the league
Cam Newton looking me in the eyes saying he wouldn’t back up Burrow or Mahomes
No NFL coach wants a backup QB willing to release manifestos like this. The backup QB’s job description includes being drama free.
Wow…he’s fucking out there, man
How do people not treat cam like a clown more lmao
Good for him.
The next stage to a career winding down, is gradual acceptance.  1. I'm a starting QB 2. Alright well if I'm back up then only these teams 3. I'll take any back up job 4. I'm announcing my retirement  (obviously include all the cam squiggly writing)  (all things being said I'm hoping he takes the backup position somewhere)
Didn’t see any high schools on that list.
Please go away Cam.   At least Tebow fan has finally gone quiet. I don’t need to hear from the Newton crew.
He should go on your with Primus. He already has the outfits
I won’t tolerate such disrespect of the GOAT Brock Purdy.
Let’s be real… this is his way of telling all the GM’s the QB’s he thinks he should be playing ahead of…. You’re not on the list? Cam thinks he’s better than you
Odd list
Cam is delusional af... he wants to backup malik who is barely holding onto his back up spot as is.
The Newton Testament, my lord, may no QB grant themselves a grander QB
“There ain’t 32 QB’s better than me”😂😂😂
This guy is a moron.
Went from there isn’t 32 guys better then me to I’ll be a back up in record time
Dudes lost his mind.
Whoever gets Richardson would be smart to pick him up he’s really the main comp for Richardson very similar players
Is he running out of money
Grand Moff Griffin: We need a statement, not a manifesto!
Cam, newsflash, not only are you a sub par QB with no upside potential and a shit attitude, but you are a pompous and arrogant pain in the ass. I'm not sure why anyone would want you on their team, so you should hold on to any job in the league you can get your hands on. Forget about your ridiculous list.
I don’t know why he keeps trying to be a qb every other year? He should just stick to the XFL where he might have a shot. Like if he was good enough, he would already be a backup.
Cam doesn’t watch Cam’s game films
I guess it can't just be a list, right?  Gotta force "manifesto" in there to make RG3 sound smarter and to make Cam sound like he's about to ramble about some crazy shit.
Bryce and Cam in Carolina let’s goooo
So, he made a list of poor QBs and QBs with a higher potential for injury??
Love you Cam 🙏🏻
No thank you
This guy is fucking cornball really thinks people care lol   Calling it “the list”  Deshaun Watson his number one
So since he didn’t get a starting job, he wants to backup someone.
Im better than 1 of 32 QBS. I mean, Im better than 1 of 32 backups.
The 3 main or at least best reasons to choose a backup quarterback imo  1. A young guy learning the job, not taken at the top of the draft but "might" be your starter some day.   2. A veteran, former starter who can still ball at least here and there and might still show occasional flashes of brilliance where he can step right in and win you a big game or two, and not just game manage against tomato cans.   3. A veteran, probably a former starter who might have been average, good, great, or even meh in his day and probably a game manger now at best and won't win you many big or maybe any games if he plays but is the consummate professional and a great mentor/unoffical coach for a young quarterback.   I don't see Cam fitting into any of these. Maybe the practice squad? Is he even worth using a spot there?
Manifesto...   RG3 obviously watched Sesame Street sometime this week and learned a new word.
I mean, is cam really in a position to claim roster spots ?
When this doesn’t work, he’s just  going to show up at a random teams training camp and try to bum rush his way in. Has a very hard time with the word No apparently. Nobody was killed in the stampede to sign him after the Auburn pro day he crashed so….not getting the hint?
This guy is a fucking clown.  He has always been a clown.
did he custom his hats to have a hole on top for his hair? im confused af
What an asshat!  These guys forgot they are employees with a skill, but are replaceable, and he’s as replaceable as any 🤦🏻‍♂️
He needs to add AJ McCarron to the list.
Oh good. The CTE is showing already.
Did he also write delusional on that manifesto?
The Malik comment was a smart one and show u dumb, he say if Malik a backup. He is too, he def don’t wanna be a titan, he was clowning us
Should have said “mahomes” then at least that way maybe he finally getsthat superbowl ring for not playing a single down
Yeah Deshaun Watson is going through a lot of turmoil 🙄 Won't someone please think of the serial sexual assaulter?
“I’ve grown to admire Deshawn Watson”
He’s finally accepting being a backup it’s the 1st step but I’d rather he coach. Grew up watching him but it’s sad watching him beg every year for a job. He can coach or be a broadcaster to me and be fine at that
He'll "backup" Willis until they realize Willis sucks and put Cam in to start.
It was a list of only 1) guys who are good but injury histories, and 2) guys he thinks he can beat straight up
Considering malik willis is a backup to tannehill that part was definitely confusing
Bruh said Malik Willis is better than him, this man has forfeited even a vet minimum contract for that.
Bro said Sam Howell 😭
If Cam shows up in camp next to Malik he is going to be the starter within hours.
He wants to go to a team that owns the means of reception
CAMTIFA BETTER NOT GET ANYWHERE THE GREAT STATE OF SANTA CLARA WHERE THE GEQBUS IS WINNING THE QB ELECTION BIGLY

Malik Willis is that polar bear in Arlington. He and Deshaun Weinstein
"I'll be the back up to the back up"
I gave him the benefit of the doubt that he wasn't picking based on......reasons....until Malik.
Sam Howell. 1 start, 58% completion, 1 TD, 1 INT, 169 yards.
You think he watched any Titans games he wasn't playing in?
"Going through a lot of turmoil, but I believe that doesn't. . . that's behind him."  woof.
That's where I shut it off. I'll just keep my memories of Super Cam I guess
Hey man according to Cam that’s all behind him now.
I remember Cam was on that I Am Athlete show. Cam was a college teammate of Aaron Hernandez and was on there saying “no way he did it”.
Yikes
“I know he’s going through some turmoil.”  Remember when Collinsworth got absolutely raked over the coals for saying something similar?
Right. Came out the gate with a terrible take and used the worst possible words to defend it. Cam has no clue what he's doing from a PR perspective. Ive got 0 interest in seeing him ever play again and this really beat the last bit of curiosity and novelty out of my system.
Cam is a fucking moron. Does nobody remember his comments to the female reporter who dared to talk about football?
Threw that “the athlete” in there just to be safe
I stopped watching after that, fuck off Cam
You mean Cam “It’s funny to hear a female talk about routes” Newton probably has some fucked up opinions about women? Gasp
Not surprising from a known sexist.
How can I get everyone to not care about my thoughts speed run
Yeah I lost interest after his first pick deshaun ticklebutts
He quickly corrected himself to player but we know what he really meant
That's about how far I got until I stopped the video lol.
Dude stared with Watson, lol
The punk who said that a female reporter admires a rapist.  Great look.
He coulda just said “I admire his play.” And moved on but…..
Just fell to my knees at Kwik Trip
Cam knows his swag can't keep up with Kirko Kohl's
Kirk Cousins isn't on this list because he's a pocket passer that has never missed a game due to injury.
How can you deny the Kirkus?
Kirk doesn’t get regularly injured and miss games lol
“Lemme throw 3 white boys in at the end”
what a hilarious list
He "admires the person" Deshaun Watson lmao
First one he listed was DeShaun Watson! On top of that, “I’ve grown to admire the person he is…” I closed the video right then and there.
He must not consider Mahomes as a black man.
Malik Willis isn’t even a starting QB
How in the fuck wouldn’t mahomes be on this list. More than likely won’t play and a real chance at a ring
 1. Deshaun Watson - history of missing games due to injury   2. Lamar Jackson - history of missing games due to injury   3. Justin Fields - history of missing games due to injury   4. Tua Tagovailoa - history of missing games due to injury   5. Malik Willis - not a starting QB in this league   6. CJ Stroud - rookie    7. Bryce Young - rookie   8. Anthony Richardson - rookie who shouldn't be starting    9. Jalen Hurts - history of missing games due to injury   10. Aaron Rodgers - oldest QB in the league with history of missing games due to injury   11. Josh Allen - history of missing games due to injury   12. Sam Howell - possibility of being benched
And Cam’s reason for backing these players up:  1. DeShaun may get into more trouble, leaving Cam as the starter. 2. Lamar might not play. 3. Similar style, and running exposes Justin to injury. 4. Concussion risk. 5. Cam will pass him on the depth chart. 6. Cam may get a chance to begin the year as the starter. 7. Cam may get a chance to begin the year as the starter. 8. Cam may get a chance to begin the year as the starter. 9. Similar style, and running exposes Jalen to injury. 10. Equal opportunity  11. Equal opportunity  12. Equal opportunity and Ron Rivera
The fact that his list has 3 players who aren’t even on a team yet is hilarious
Joe Burrow in shambles
Non white QBs? Why not mahomes lol
"Watson might get touchy again and get suspended, Jackson might get hurt or traded, Fields might get hurt, Tua will get hurt, Malik won't win the job, rookies might not be ready immediately, Hurts might get hurt(s), Rodgers might retire or wander off into the woods or something, Allen might get hurt, and Howell might suck."
Dude just wants to chill with these guys lol
I like that Mac Jones Isn't on there because he already lost his job to him lol
So, trying to figure out the logic behind this, I think Ive spotted some of it  Stroud/Young/Richardson -- he thinks he has chance to start ahead of them and mentor them for a while.  Aaron Rodgers -- Guess he figures he's old, and mentally unstable enough to just walk out any day.    Tua -- Is probably surprised Tua is still allowed to play.  Thinks chances of Tua dying on the field are as high as him getting through a whole season -- much like the rest of us .    Malik Willis -- Do you know who he is?  Thats EXACTLY why he's on the list.  Josh Allen/Justin Field/Jalen Hurts -- Figures all mobile QBs have limited number of lives.      Sam Howell -- Probably has no idea who Sam Howell is, and noone told him that the Commanders signed Brissett.
Surprise, surprise.  The guy that finds it funny when women talk about football is gungho about being a backup for Deshaun Watson.
You know Trey Lance is in shambles, driving around downtown (wherever the fuck Cam lives) digging through his phone for his number  Fuck it’s been too long, someone do the correct Mark Cuban DeAndre Jordan meme
Imagine making demands as a backup.
Why would we want Cam when we have MIKE MOTHERFUCKING WHITE
No Burrow or Mahomes is insane
Is that a list of people that he thinks he will end up as the starter for one reason or another, plus Josh Allen and Jalen Hurts?
I feel like there is a pretty big name missing from this list.
Sam Howell. What?
2,3, 4 is likely he takes the spot. Those guys will get hurt.
“A list of people I could end up starting over due to injury or performance issues, plus Jalen Hurts”
Ahhh shit, here we go again  In all honesty though, I’d love to see cam back on the panthers.
List is inaccurate, if you listen, Hurts is 7th, Rodgers 8th, Allen is 9th, and Howell is 10th. You mistakenly counted CJ Youngson as three people.
WHERE RUSS AT, CAM?
So he doesn't want to go to the Titans unless he's QB3?
So basically anyone who can run
Yeah, Id rather roll with PJ Walker as the backup over dealing with Cams obnoxious ego. Also, PJ is probably the better QB as of now.
Aw, I guess this means there's no hope for Buccaneers legend Cam Newton...
I don’t care to watch the video but why’d he put Watson at #1?
Lol all the guys who are most likely to get injured
So there aren’t 32 guys better than him, but he’s willing to back up three guys who haven’t even been drafted yet? So I guess there’s 29 QB’s better than him.
4 are draft picks? So he literally doesn't know where or what team he'd be on? 1 is a sex offender and another doesn't plan to play?  Cam might be as much of a punkass as we thought... the whole time.
Thank you
He chose starters that seem likely to miss some time with injury based on recent history or aren't guaranteed to hold their starting spot.
Barely even that
   The list doesn’t say starting QB. With our O-Line, he knows it’s a high likelihood Tannehill and Willis gets injured this year. He’s playing 4-D Chess.
Dilute the meaning of words for reasons
It's not even a manifesto since you have to actually publish it. Dude just listed a bunch of his homies on camera and it's a manifesto?
He knows he can't hang with Jacoby.
Geno Smith will not write him back
Dak too
Russell Wilson in shambles
Tom Brady retired though?
I mean he said only 12 quarterbacks, and 3 them were white, considering probably 15-16 starters next year will be black he definitely didn't hit everyone in the league
It’s injury prone guys, rookies mostly, so he probably thinks he’ll get games if he plays behind these dudes.
The Dak disrespect!  - Twitter Cowboys fans
I don't know if it's because I'm living in Europe or because I'm not American or whatever, but I was surprised when the media started talking about the Super Bowl having 2 starting QBs that happened to be black, was like "wait, did Mahomes get injured or something?"
Am I delusional to believe that the Browns are also dumb enough to sign him to be a backup?
He’s gonna be in his 50s listing qbs he could start over
It feels like he is retired whether he wants to admit it or not.  Even in this video he says that he's an NFL caliber starter. The fact is that ever since he injured his shoulder, he has not been a good quarterback. I fully believe he is good enough to make a roster as a backup but with his attitude and the general circus that he brings with him, I don't think anyone is going to bother signing him.
Cam is definitely better than a majority of the 96 QBs. He has gotten 0 phone calls, because up until this point he has been strongly against playing backup and he's not better than a majority of starting QBs and the few that he could be better than are most likely making less than he'd sign for, or it's a team that simply wouldn't want the Cam Newton experience.
ßĒT ¥ØŪ ₩ØŪŁDÑ'T ŠÅ¥ THÅT TØ M¥ FÅÇĒ. Ï MĒÅÑ HÏŠ FÅÇĒ.
Feels like at this point that most of the players in the league do. Which is not a great thing IMO
Shit, even the XFL. The Guardians need to throw him out there.
His ego is too big, but yeah probably.
Honestly would be so entertaining to watch him; he’s probably not too terrible but in the USFL he’d still be god like
Think about it
Yep, I have been the biggest Cam defender his entire career, but the lighthearted, fun and competitive arrogance is sliding into arrogance out of spite, delusion and desperation. Not a good look.
You can't be choosy if nobody chooses you.
His ego wouldn't allow himself to be on the PS.
He's easily better than about half the backups in the league, it's just that up till now, he'd shown no interest in that.
You’re absolutely right that Cam is a rich man’s taysom hill at this point but without the home run ability.
But at least he's a good dresser.  Oh wait
It almost seemed like a joke lmao.
Yeah, nice 10 year old meme
my favorite theory is that it's a belated april fool's b/c he had his staff focusing on what legacy checkmarks he wanted purged last week
He needs cash so he's pumping Doge Coin again to sell some.
I genuinely don’t understand why anyone still plays in Elon’s sandbox. I don’t miss it at all, either.
Lmao I love that you threw the sharp s in there
Yup and he definitely thinks Tua is black lmao
I guess it’d be 36 guys since he’s willing to be behind Malik Willis, who’s a backup, and 3 rookies who aren’t drafted yet
The fact that you were taking him seriously at any point while wearing that hat is impressive.
BuT hE LiSteD tHrEe WhItE qBs?
There is absolutely a pro football league in China it's just that it's an absolute joke. He would fucking tear it up though. I followed a guy named the wonton don from Boston that walked on and won a Superbowl over there. If you search dragon skin on YouTube he did a series for the whole season.
No, tj watt did
Good try, but it was actually watt that ended cam’s future career.  If you want your team to have some credit, you can count the headhunting. ☺️  # let’s ride
Easy to win when the refs take your opponent out of the game
Does he say dumb things, or is he just an asshole misogynist? Frankly, it seems like the latter.
When you've been handed everything because of your physical gifts, this is an attitude that can develop. Cam is desperately trying to cling to football because he has no other skills and he's learning the real world doesn't give a shit about him the way the football world did.
I do not like this  "Deshaun Watson. I've grown to admire the person..."  Turned it off
It’s not the fact that he’s not good enough, it’s the fact that he’s not as good of an investment as (all) the others are.  Everyone knows how good he was, it’s not a secret.  That said, I don’t see a problem with prioritizing what job opportunities you’d like to pursue. If a guy wants to or doesn’t want to play somewhere or with someone, it should be important to them and their prospective employer.  What I have a problem with, like you, is that admiration he has for Watson. What a weird thing to say and just downright creepy when combined with this desire to transform himself into some kind of mentor archetype for youngsters coming into the league that he wants to “groom.”
Everything aside your saying he was good five years ago and that nothing else counts. He was good for a tiny part of his oats time and has been terrible in every showing for five years. Also his MVP was like ten years ago, bringing it up is silly at best.
Three? The niners have three currently and are rumored to be after Brady, Rodgers, Big Ben, Stafford,  cousins and potentially trading up…  Edit: added Cousins duh, how could I forget?
What the hell are you talking about? It seems like you had a visceral reaction to hearing that word and are projecting that reaction onto other people.
It's cuz they got angry they had actual groomers like Matt Gaetz and had to find a way to make it not mean anything. They did the same thing with "fake news" during the 2016 election cycle and "woke".
Then leave bro
If he was he would be starting at one of those positions. He’s not, that’s why he’s recording pod casts. He still believes the same as you
This is a list of QB’s the Cam has a chance of getting on the field due to injury risk, experience, and style that increases injury risk. Seahawks system relays more on arm talent then athleticism (although athleticism is a plus), and Cam’s arm is cooked.
I think he’s talking about players he thinks he could useful helping. To me it seems like opposite, like he doesn’t think he can teach them anything valuable
Wouldn’t put it past him. He’s a douche.
It’s too late, they realized this last year before they picked up dobbs. I think not passing for 100 yds in a game was a big part of that...probably
Lol Malik isn’t our starter?  He’d be third string
I'd really hope everyone in the Titans franchise already realizes this.
God no please
Until they realize Cam sucks(they already know).
I was going to comment this but I see you already see what I seen. I think he knows backing up malik Willis is a chess move for him because they're absolutely going to take malik out the game after his first questionable decision making and BOOM Cam will end up being the starter for the titans.... That is def a chess move in my opinion. But he also stated that Willis was a C1N 7on7 all star so Cam must of seen his skills during the 7on7 and has some sort of belief in his skill set. Cam will surely win the job over Willis I believe.   I wonder why he never mentioned mahomes to backup. I wonder If it because he knows there's no chance of coming unto the game beyond a injury OE if he doesn't like Patrick or what. But is In Kansas city need a backup for mahomes  that we are confident in.
He didn’t say Malik Willis is better than him. He said that he realizes franchises have already made up their mind about who to play and that he’s willing to go to that situation to help mentor
Evenly distribute rushing yards between QB’s and RB’s
From each according to his ability, to each according to his incentive clause.
The means of protection
He needs to come to Chicago and mentor fields... Cam was great at knowing when to use his legs vs his arm.
*It’s funny to hear a capitalist talk about routes.*
WE ARE STANDING BACK AND STANDING BY
This is even better if you imagine Rom from Deep Space Nine walking out and reading this for him at a press conference.
“Our SB wins”  -	Jimmy G, probably
...that might be a bit more readable, just because the font forces you to read reeeeaaalllllyyyy slowly  EDIT: This would probably work better as a Das Kapital joke
They don't throw red flags, they throw clear flags. That's why you never see them
"I'm just a dude backing up a dude, backing up another dude"
He has coached Malik at a QB summer camp or something. Same with Fields and Watson.  He’s just picking players he’s mentored for those
He threw Howell in to be fair and left Mahomes off
I know you’re trying to say something but there’s literally nothing wrong with cam wanting to backup mostly black quarterbacks  oh no did Cam hurt the poor white mans feelings? Whatever shall we do
The Commanders have been consistently saying they plan on having him as the starter
1 blowout of a playoff winning team, 0 losses
This man stumbled answering a question nobody asked him lmao
Said it before. People would be mortified if they knew what most players thought about the Watson situation.
First guy you list too. Bad look.
Cam is a misogynistic moron.
Honestly part of me believes he chose the QB’s whose situations could suddenly change, whether that’s due to injury or off-the-field issues. Ick either way though
its not the behind 'him' thats the problem....
He did quickly correct it to the athlete he's become, but then said his problems were "turmoil" that is "behind him now" wtf lol. Just say Deshaun Watson and move on Cam, guy always puts his foot in his mouth. "Its funny to hear a female talk about routes"
To most fans Watson is isn’t a real person. We haven’t met him and only know him through TV. Cam has known him since he was a kid. He played on Cams 7-on-7 team. (for reference, a lot of the guys on this list Cam met through 7-on-7 as kids) it’s easier to accept that a stranger did something wrong than with someone we know.
Cam's always had some shitty opinions tho. Remember when he was insulting a female reporter for having the gall to ask him questions about football?
This isn't surprising if you've heard what he thinks about women.
*gently dabs while silently weeping*
Yeah I loved cam back in the day during the panthers but this is such a bad take.
...or at least behind the towel now
Damn he probably thinks OJ was innocent too
Just choked on my cheese curds at my local Culver’s that he didn’t say Love 🤧
My wife is from the mid west and honestly the best thing about it is Kwik Trip
Kwik Trip is legit
Down here I'm afraid we only have QuickTrip  I'm not joking
Howell is 100% on the list because of Newton's relationship with Rivera. He thinks he has a chance to be signed by Washington and win the job. I have my doubts.
Literally lmao
“But not Joe Burrow”
I thought the exact same thing lol
>“Lemme throw 3 white boys in at the end”   I'm not gonna say anything... just draw your own conclusions.
Literally 🤣😂 I was crying at this list, he reversed Token’d us
100%. its so easy to see why he picked the first 9 lol
This isn't a top qbs of all time list....its pretty clear why he chose who he chose....ysll are race obsessed it's actually sad
You don’t understand, Mahomes isn’t better than Newton. Cam Newton new starting Chiefs QB, confirmed.
We all know yall would use Henne over Cam
I said this list is really weird on a Facebook NFL page and was promptly assaulted for it
It’s the unintentional smoking gun for the argument against drafting / acquiring running quarterbacks
List of guys mostly with injury histories or unproven rookies giving him a fighting chance for play time.  It makes sense to me.
Teams where he thinks he'll have a good chance at starting every once in a while
lmao. So the Jets are going after Aaron Rodgers *and* Cam Newton?
Given the incredibly sexist things Cam Newton has said during press conferences (example: "*Females* talking about routes"), I have zero reason to believe he's bullshitting here.
Even he caught how he sounded and said “the player he is” to play it off. And that’s his friend lol. I love cam but any endorsement of Watson is disgusting and enabling
Obviously, his mother diluted his blackness so much that Cam could no longer back him up.
I don't see Russ there either.
I mean looking at the list it seems like places where he would be moderately likely to take over at some point in the season.
List is who is likely to get injured but still have a decent team.  No 49ers as they have 3 qbs signed
People are jumping on the race thing but it's really a combination of QBs who went to his camp, QBs with a similar play style and then potential playing time.  Mahomes is basically a 0 for those last 2.
Because Mahomes has jumped onto a loose ball and that intimidates Cam.
He has little to no chance of starting behind Mahomes.
I could see whoever drafts richardson actually making some sense to bring cam in as a 3rd stringer, similar to how the ravens had rg3 as a third stringer when they drafted lamar.
> Aaron Rodgers - oldest QB in the league with history of missing games due to injury  Oldest, yes.  History of missing injuries?  Nah.  Fuck nah.  He's played 81 straight and not missed a game in 5 seasons, missed more a game in only 4 of the his 15 seasons starting (two seasons missing one game, one of which was resting the final game).  Among the most reliable QBs in the league.  This is a hilariously bad take here.
Jalens played 15 games in each of the last 2 seasons though…
I don’t think he has any chance of being benched it’s injury concerns why he listed him and possibly even off the field issues (maybe).  Edit: didn’t realize he endorsed Watsons character. Yikes but I’m also somehow not surprised when players do. I feel like it’s far more common than we think.
Josh has a history of missing games due to injury? Lol Those few games he missed his rookie year and has played a full season in the 4 years since.
Watson comes with the added bonus of looking great by comparison.  No matter how badly you play, nobody's gonna start advocating for Watson.  And if you play well, people will love you all the more because now they don't have to root for Deshaun Watson.
You really think the browns would bench a guy they just gave that much money to?
Allen missed games in 2018 from injury. But if he’s injured this year, Allen will come in for Allen.
Aaron’s old but I don’t think he’s missed a game in the last three seasons. Jimmy G on the other hand should have been first on the list. Not Malik Willis.
There’s gotta be some kind of pattern.
Josh Allen has missed like 1 game since he took over….
Josh Allen has an injury history but has only missed 4 games due to injury in his career, all of which occurred in 2018 with his rookie season.   I think Cam has him on there because of Josh Allen's playing style, which could lead to more injuries down the line.
Delete this nephew.
Right. Most names look to me like injury prone guys. So makes sense why he'd prefer to be their backup.
It’s not all about the QB either, Allen plays for Buffalo, Fields Chicago, etc.
Trying to pull a Ryan Fitzpatrick, I see.
Who the Fck is Sam Howell
Fields doesn’t have a history of missing games due to injury, he played through broken ribs last season…
That's what I was looking for, lol.  He's picked guys he thinks he has a chance to play over because of off field issues, injury concerns, maybe gonna retire so Cam can start next year??? (Rodgers), and rookies that are unknown quantities so they are potential busts.
Enlighten me about Josh Allen’s history of missing games to injury. I had no idea.
lol do me next
>Josh Allen - history of missing games due to injury  He has missed very few games in his career. And one he left early was for concussion protocol     https://www.draftsharks.com/fantasy/injury-history/josh-allen/9962
Deshaun was awful last year as well
I suspect a lot of that has to do with the ankle injury. We had one of the most reliably clutch backups in the league, and the coaches and staff still had to fight to get Mahomes sat long enough to get x-rayed and taped. Cam knows he wouldn't see the field for the Chiefs unless Mahomes was in really bad shape. I'm betting Burrow would have been just as stubborn as Mahomes about playing.
He’s being slick. He’ll “back up” the guys until they suck or get hurt, and then start.
Thanks for the information. Still don’t know what to do with it.
Also guys who went to his camp, which includes Howell.
With that logic bro should’ve named any of the niners qbs, with our track record he’s bound to get a shot at starter at some point in the season
like...josh allen and jalen hurts?
He said he would back up Howell, so he likely would be backing up Jacoby as well
I’m not convinced he would even be QB2 for us, Rush might be better than him at this point.
He said Black QBs
Cams crimes were funny and Deshawns crimes are well definitely not funny.
Nah it would be so on brand
He was actually pretty clean cut coming out of the draft. However, he did have those sulking on the bench moments which wasn't ideal for the leader of a team but not a huge deal I guess. At some point he dropped the act and shifted to what he is now.  If he was smart, he'd shift to wanting to be a weapon for a contender. Hell, just having the right attitude would get him a contract from somewhere. The whole reason he's not on a roster is because of the circus he generates.
What starting QBs are we positive he would be better than?
It’s one of the few things that makes me question if Deshaun actually is innocent in some ways. Coaches, players, teammates all seem to like and respect him for the most part.
He would absolutely destroy the USFL. Probably be beneficial to show that off if he really wants any chance of a starting job, but no way his ego lets him do that.   I mean hell AJ McCaron might’ve played himself into a transitional QB starter for a team like Atlanta or something.
Lol there was plenty of flat out arrogance before this.
He’s too good to be on the PS. He’d be a great addition to a QB room for mentorship and film study. Honestly whoever drafts AR should consider Cam.
He’s better than a lot of them. But he’s far too big of a personality to have sitting behind a young QB.
Problem is he wants it to be the cam show. You don't want a backup being the center of attention saying he's gonna come in and mentor people and then immediately say he admires Watson.
Shilling some crypto coin for another round of pump n' dump is my guess.
He wants people to like him so bad
And yet here we are on NFL's #1 twitter aggregator
I mean it's just as much of a shithole as reddit really. This place is just plagued with bots farming karma and astroturfing the hell out of anything politics/product related.
Lol sure
Lolol
I mean, isn't that most of the league? I've seen very few players actually condemn any of the disgusting behaviour from the many terrible people in the league.
That seems like a harsh take. The guy devoted his life to the game, the fans, and the community. It's tough to walk away or feel rejected when you still have gas in the tank.  He has other business ventures and by staying in the football conversation, he's continuing to build his brand. Yes, he'll alienate some people in the process, but I doubt they were going to his cigar bar anyway.
Yikes
You forgot Cousins too, lol.
He most certainly is. The issue teams have with Cam is that he’s the most natural leader in the entire league. No one captures the hearts and minds of other players like Cam. When he joins your team the whole squad is going to want him to start. So he can’t effectively backup anyone without seriously fracturing the locker room.  Loads of teams would rather just have “their” guy. Someone who they can easily control and won’t cause much of a fuss.
Yeah They literally had a practice squad guy come in and start after 3 days of practice over Willis. I like him and idk if he’ll ever be ready honestly but it sure as shit isn’t now. He wouldn’t even be a good tank commander cause he’d suck so bad it’d ruin whatever confidence he has
And Cam will be 4th
Probably the worst qb I've ever seen in my near 3 decades of watching football. He wasn't just bad, he looked like he had never played the sport in his life.
I'm totally fine if they still want to try. Gardner Minshew can be the third best QB in the division.
“Let the opposing defenses tremble at a Cammunistic revolution. The skill positions have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a Super Bowl to win.”
Jokes are getting a *liiiiittle* heady for this sub at the moment     ^(myself included)
Absolutely. I read the manifesto in like 2 hours and it was comprehensible. I've been reading Capital for like 2+ years.
Because Howell went to his camp
Tell me more!
Sure, but why does he make this list? Which of those 11 completions told a guy who believes he can be an NFL starter that he'd be happy to back him up?
That's my Cam! To be fair at least he acknowledged it.
Too be fair, Cam has a history of being a misogynistic asshole so him siding with the serial sexual assaulter isn't a surprise.
I don't respect any NFL players opinion.  Nothing would mortify me.  DeShawn Watson is on the lower list of all time NFL scumbags.  People have murdered people and beat the shit out of women.  But hey... they run fast
Or anything.   Drew Brees almost got forced into an early retirement by players for not being pro kneeling enough, meanwhile Desean Jackson literally quoting Hitler? Nobody gives a fuck.
Is there even a single one who took a stance against him
I think it's fair to say Cam is in the crowd of braindead athletes that 110% believe Watson was the victim. I will say the most disappointing part of the Watson saga isn't even that he got no punishment, I expected that, it's not even that nobody speaks up against his actions, it's that so many other athletes actively endorse him.
It's funny to hear a laptop stealing misogynist talk about a serial rapist.  If cam wasn't born as one of the most gifted athletes ever he'd struggle to hold down a job at a 7/11. Dudes an absolute moron. That goes for probably a majority of professional athletes too but fuck so many football players are such idiots  I wish there was a bigger pushback from the media about this shit. Even "alternative'' podcasts like PMT gloss over shit like James Winston being a sex pest.   It's hard to get my girlfriend into watching the game when so many stars are awful people.
As though routes are some esoteric concept  Cam stfu
"shut the fuck up. Please. Just shut the fuck up"
Unless you know something I don't, Cam may be referencing this https://youtu.be/I52v0SUxAb4  Some 7on7 sponsorship stuff he does and has other players help him with. Newton is also 6 years older and so probably didn't play the same youth leagues as the Browns QB
Having negative stereotypical views of women and how much they know about football is definitely bad, but it's not Deshaun Watson bad.
Couldn't even finish my business at Kum & Go when he didn't mention Russell Wilson
Also sounds like Cam picked all the QBs that went to his football camp.
No it’s because Howell is an alum of his C1N training program. That’s why he and Willis are even on the list
Washington already signed brissett so would never happen anyways.
He does not have a chance in hell to win the job.
Sam Howell also was part of C1N so that’s probably a reason why
Alot of these younger guys went through Cams C1N camp when they were younger. That’s why they’re on the list
Or Herbert
Or Mahomes lmao
Conclusion: Cam Newton is a mild racist and sexual aggressor sympathizer. This video honestly made me lose a lot of respect for him, but I also had never kept up on him heavily before this, and I'm sure this isn't new information.
What's so obvious about it? His #1 is a serial sexual abuser. I wouldn't want to be anywhere near him if I had the choice.
Yes it’s pretty clear why he chose who he chose, race
Burrow also suspiciously absent.    Seems like he listed every mobile or at least semi-mobile QB, with the exception of Mahomes and maybe a few others
Henne retired bby :(
Henne was so fucking clutch for a backup that yes. At the skill levels displayed the last few years it's not a question for me haha
We would, but he's retired.  Still no way I would want an ego like Cam's in a backup role.
>Faceb-  This is right when I realized what a mistake you made
Facebook is an absolute cesspool
I’m sure that he wanted to add Jameis Winston, but he’s not a sure fire starter.   Who could forget when he told a class of elementary school children that ‘girls should be silent’
"The struggles... Uh...  that he has been dealing with... Uhhh... BUT thats behind him."
And even HE didn't wanna go to San Francisco  We're a damn QB graveyard
Kenny P safe from harm  This is not a jinx
Yeah top 3 are arguably the most mobile QBs currently starting for a team (unless we wanna jump into the Lamar can of worms) and all three of those guys could miss time for injury. Justin and Lamar already have
I agree, but I feel like instead of opening by swooning over Watson for a minute and a half he should have said how much he’d love to backup Kyler once he comes back. Even visit him in the hospital and play video games with him.
Mahomes did have some injuries last year too though so that makes you wonder why he isn't on the list
But he has a chance to start with Josh Allen of Aaron Rodgers?
Cam was incredible but I don’t want that dude trying to teach and mould a rookie on a team I root for
He's missed three games in two seasons due to injury and has a play style that has a higher risk of injury. I'm not saying he'll definitely miss any games this season only that Cam's thought process is pretty obvious.
Yeah, and Josh Allen missed four games his rookie year and zero the last four seasons. They have as much of a history of missing games due to injury as Mahomes does
Oh I didn't even think about that angle. I'm not sure if Cam did either but it's an interesting way to look at it.
While he hasn’t assaulted any women, Cam’s praised Watson and has a history of saying offensive shit about women.
I spaced on that and couldn't think of anything else. I should put his injury history.
Yea there is no shot Deshaun Watson is getting benched. He was not great but not bad enough to lose his job and lets not forget he is getting 230 million guaranteed. I get people do not like him but do people actually think there is a possibility he will lose his job?
Top 5 QB has a couple bad games and might get benched lol they got it
But why male models?
Lmao. That's fair
Sign Cam Newton?
You go hmm that's interesting. Guy wants to prove himself it seems. Then go eat a handful of peanuts and go to bed.
Wait I thought rush left?
Russell is a cornball but lets not start measuring blackness.
Cam's shenanigans are cheeky and fun, Deshawn's are cruel and tragic.
I don't know that there is any I'd say we're positive he is better than, but there are a few you could make a debate for. If we look at who we presume is the starters this year, I wouldn't waste time arguing for Mayfield or Trask, whoever the Bucs choose. Mayfield looked good on the Rams and inept in Carolina. If the Rodgers trade falls through and the Jets wheel out Wilson, I think I'd even agree with people saying he's worse than Cam. I don't think we've seen enough consistently good play from Pickett, personally I'd argue his ceiling is far greater than washed Cam, but I wouldn't have a good argument against it either. Wilson looked absolutely cooked last season and he could either return to form with Payton or torch public opinion on Payton, so I wouldn't be too surprised for someone to say Wilson either.    I'm sure there are others people could debate and you could be convinced slightly either way, these are just the lowest hanging fruits I can see. Either way I stand by that there is no potential starters that Cam is **positively** better than based on the last few years that we have seen line up for a snap.
Zach Wilson.
Lol people liked Ben too but that doesn’t mean they aren’t both sexual assaulters.
What an odd thought process
I mean, he’s likely either a sociopath or a full blown psychopath. He’s very manipulative and I mean look at how most of the media was wrapped around his finger before this
IMO, its quite possible and maybe even likely that DW thought he was paying IG massage therapists for sex, and most of the time he was right. The big problem (understatement) obviously he wasn't always right about that, and SA occurred. Some level of naivety seems to have occurred, but the amount of and on who (aka whos more responsible) will never be agreed or realistically ever confirmed. And it does seem there is evidence that some of the victims may have jumped on the victim train when they may have been cognizant of the transaction they agreed to (which would have been technically still illegal). But thats another point which will never be confirmed, in an endless he said she said.
One in five women has experienced sexual assault in her life (and 1 in 6 men). How many people do you know who have committed sexual assault? Hell, how many people do you know who could say "yea, I know a rapist"?  Now think, how many people do you know who cry big, big crocodile tears for their friend who was "falsely accused by some crazy bitch"?  Most people refuse to believe someone they know is a piece of garbage.
He got cut from the Pats because he specifically refused to be a mentor and backup to Mac Jones. Maybe AR would be more exciting to him but he threw a fit when he lost the starting job.
Lol in what world is he a good mentor? His football iq was terrible as were his throwing mechanics and read progressions. Anything besides his raw physicality was pedestrian in the league.
Would he? He had trouble learning the Pats playbook.
Our entire squad raved about how great he was to Kyle Allen that year he had to sit out for a while, I could see him making the transition if he's genuinely interested in doing so. He's a great dude.
Could be worse, the NFL could leave Twitter and we need to wait for breaking news to be "truthed".
Just admit you don't pay attention to the Panthers.
>still have gas in the tank.  He doesn't though. He proved that in NE.  He only has other business ventures because of his football money. How much of a business mind do you really think Cam has? The prime of his life is over and he's desperately trying to cling to it like many forced-retired athletes do.
Believe what you want, showmanship and leadership aren’t the same thing. Superman left the league during the Super Bowl of 2015. The issue is that people, including Cam himself, don’t yet want to admit it.
Dobbs broke it down in an interview and it was even worse. It wasn't even real practice. It was just basic walkthroughs.   His first time ever actually running most of the plays for us was in a live game.
I think everyone knew when drafting him he would have to sit out a year or 2
He’ll definitely be above Willis. That guy is trash and I knew he was trash during his college days.
There’s a specter haunting the NFL
everyone jumps on the table or no one jumps on the table but if you break a table you have to replace it
The math behind yarn is very important
“Im okay with it because of my crippling white guilt” -u/jugeezy (probably)
what’s on your mind
I mean he probably wants to sign with them partially because there's a good chance Howell is not worthy of being a starter which could open the way for him to play
Because Ron Rivera is the coach there so might be his best chance to get a contract lol
“It’s funny to hear a man on the moon talk about misogyny”
Your name isnt related to the Andy Kauffman biopic with Jim carrey, is it?
[removed]
One comment to a reporter isn’t the same realm as sexually assaulting someone but go and hate on
Were you around when the NFL ran the domestic abuse commercial in the wake of the Ray Rice incident? Had probably a half dozen NFL players in front of a white background crying because domestic abuse was so bad and it needed to stop.  When you are aware of how scummy the NFL is and that they don’t care about scum if the dude is fast and / or can throw really well, that commercial was the most laughable thing on the planet. Obviously domestic abuse is awful, not saying that is laughable. The NFL trying to run an ad campaign saying how bad it is, while literally employing known abusers was. They can’t even clean up their own house.
Most women would rather take a punch to the face than be sexually assaulted. So he isn't really below those guys on the list.
Yeah. Football is fun to watch as a sport but if you actually get to know a lot of the players or what their thoughts/values are you'd get turned off real fast... That's why is fun to watch from a distance.
I somewhat understand it, I'm sure a lot of these guys do deal with crazy women but with Deshaun it pretty clearly wasn't a one off situation. The total lack of consequences he's faced is so disappointing, but also unsurprising in the NFL. I mean its not like he did something as horrible as smoke weed
Yes, but it makes it a lot less surprising!
I accidentally put about 9 gallons of diesel in my gas tank at UDF when he didn't pronounce a desire to back up Joe Burrow.  It'll be fine if I dilute it 50:50 with gasoline.  I hope.
No shot he mentions Willis if he didn’t go to the camp because Willis isn’t even the starter
I like how Tua was the only dude Cam didn’t give a reason for. It’s like everyone knows Tua’s gonna get injured but he clearly can’t come out and say it.
They’re on the list because he can probably beat them both out of a job
Seriously, find me someone that would rather have Cam Newton today over Brissett as even a backup. I think we were thrown in as a desperation "I hope coach still loves me" "surely ya'll think I'm better than this" play for this list, but in the end it just proves how far out of the league Cam really is.  Man wrecked his body for his team, and now he has no value.  Hope he finds a way forward, but honestly I don't want to see him on TV as a talking head or a player.
Signing cam feels like a snyder move and hopefully the bad man isnt making those decisions anymore
If you watched the video he stated as much. It was purely for most of these guys that they were a part of his camps and he would like to aid their development.
Remember when Riverboat Ron turned to Wentz in a must win? Probably his best odds of seeing the field.
Or Mahomes
He also said it was funny to hear a “female” talk about running routes
You're upset because Most of the qbs were black? I know reddit swings one way but this is too sensitive. Have fun tho
Black man wants to work with and be around   other black men. Literally nothing wrong with that’s   ITT racists mad
Yeah those are all teams with QB play he can fill in and replicate. Then you have Rodgers and Howell in there for good measure.
He clearly has a type
And Herbert
Burrow didn’t go to his camp… he only picked young guys that went to his camp
He retired a champion who did some heavily lifting to win that title. I'm sorry to see him go but he did it in style.
Wait what!? When? I'm a Michigan fan and I was holding on onto the fact that was the last player from my young childhood still around. Brandon Graham it's on you I guess
Total Chad
Or in a locker room, and it looks like most teams agree.
Dude needs to fucking let it go. He's washed and a diva to boot. Great, you won an MVP...nearly **10 years ago** ! So did Matt Ryan and look where he's at now. Both washed.
He’s already tired of losing to the GEQBUS
You really want a dude with cam's injury history?
But could you imagine what Shanahan would do with a Full House package with Cam running a goal line read-option with CMC and Deebo?
Too white to backup, sorry.
Deshaun Watson is definitely not more mobile than Josh Allen or Jalen Hurts
May want him just to fill in though. He can run a similar offense (in style, not saying as good as)
Cams thought process follows a pretty clear pattern and its not injury lol
There’s not actually any data that suggests that QBs who rush get injured more. Idk why everyone always states that like it’s a fact.
Why do people keep thinking Watson is even close to top 5? He'd be lucky to even be top 15 at this point.
It’s not 2020.
I spaced and forgot about his injury. It was the only thing I could think of. But to be fair there's no evidence he's currently a top five QB.
He just signed a 2 year deal  https://twitter.com/GehlkenNFL/status/1636731477072265216?s=20
Rob Parker, that you?
Which... makes them not really shenanigans at all.
Did you forget cam was absolutely trash his last yr in the league? He hasn’t gotten younger or better since.
And Kobe but God forbid that gets brought up.
God damn the meat riding for Ben on McAfee the other day was absolutely infuriating
Not even one of the few it’s litteraly the only thing that makes me question my opinion of Deshaun.
Is it really all that odd that one of the few things that makes me question why I hate someone is that the people that actually know them don’t hate them?
Pretty sure loads of people liked OJ
Sounds like that statistic you cited is not accurate at all: https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/no-1-in-5-women-have-not-been-raped-on-college-campuses https://www.forbes.com/sites/evangerstmann/2019/01/27/the-stat-that-1-in-5-college-women-are-sexually-assaulted-doesnt-mean-what-you-think-it-means/?sh=1ca6deb22217
That’s actually not true
Kyle Allen, you say?
No one does lmao
Jesus Christ
And yet I thought Dobbs played a good game with the division on the line. I remember his accuracy stood out and his toughness considering he took 4 sacks and was pressured 13 times. Had a lead entering halftime but just couldn't maintain their offense in the second half. Beat out my expectations though.
This is astonishing. Thanks.
If you listen to this sub there's no such thing as project QB anymore.  Don't even try an bring up the fact the general consensus use to be year 3 or 32+ starts before you knew if the player would make the cut in the NFL.
It’s hilarious how he was hyped up by some as a potential top 3 pick last year.
I still remember the news when Ryan Tannehill said he ain't here to mentor him and people shit on him. Maybe he knows something
One of a few big examples that guys who popped off during the Covid cfb season might be paper tigers. See also Wilson, Zach.
…congrats?
Yeah, some of the talking heads were trying to get the Steelers to take him, and supposedly he was on Tomlin's radar.  Glad they didn't make that move, I think Pickett will be fine for a decade or so.
Let's pump the brakes a bit.  He's definitely not NFL material but he also definitely wasn't trash during his time at Liberty.  You don't get 40 touchdowns and 3,700 total yards in a season if you're trash.  He was a good player whose play style was unlikely to transfer to the NFL.
I mean, it's interesting and there's a lot of interesting information to be gleaned. But it is rather repetitive at times. And someone should maybe update for modern manufacturing.
It has nothing to do with white guilt and everything to do with having an understanding of why a once enslaved race wouldn’t want to be surrounded by those that enslaved them
I wanna know more about why picking your work situation based on the race of your coworkers is ok by you. Is that something you do?
He says in the video that he's a C1N guy. It's a promo for his 7v7 hustle.
One of these days Alice, wham! to the moon.  And by that I mean myself, I think we need a break.
RIP your yogurt sponsorship.
Related to buzz aldrin
That wasn't the only time he made degrading comments about women.  https://www.nbcboston.com/news/sports/cam-newtons-misogynistic-comments-about-women-criticized/2692020/  >Also you guys signed Greg Hardy, after he nearly beat his GF to death. Fuck off.  What does that have to with Cam being a misogynistic douche? Lmao  You're just randomly lashing out.  Edit: Also, I'm race baiting? Lmao  Just because I'm critical of what a guy said doesn't mean I'm racist. I've been just as critical about things Rodgers has said. Does that mean I'm racist against white people too?  What a stupid fucking statement. Take your own advice and fuck off. If you have to resort to calling people racist because your fragile psyche can't handle a black athlete being criticized for the things he says then maybe you should stay off the internet.  As far as I'm concerned, you're the only one race baiting here. Desperately looking for any reason to label someone racist to just blindly dismiss their opinions.
[removed]
He's made multiple comments  https://www.nbcboston.com/news/sports/cam-newtons-misogynistic-comments-about-women-criticized/2692020/  And no, he isn't the same as Watson but Cam being sympathetic towards him makes more sense when you consider his opinions on women.
Lmao, I think I remember this now. They probably got like 50 guys to get on there and took the 5 sincere players and made a PSA out of it. Woof, I would love to see that commercial again.  https://youtu.be/cfto6ZXgt70  This one was all scripted but I thought there was one with tears and stuff.  I found it!! https://youtu.be/elC3MTbJWgU
It's pretty wild to me that people value pro athlete's opinions on most things over that of a normal person.  I remember one interview, media asked a player some question about applying for jobs. The player straight up said that he's never had a résumé or applied for a job, because his entire focus from like age 14 was making the NFL.
Yeah definitely no going back after smoking dope. That’s not a minor offense such as sexually assaulting 30ish women or beating a guy half to death outside an elevator directly in front of a camera.
Bruh holy shit I completely forgot about tannehill, wtf that’s wild
Did I say I’m upset?
Did I say there was something wrong with it?
Guess with Mahomes he just said “fuck it that guy’s in his own league”
He wants to back up Rodgers on the Packers then fight for starting job with Jordan Love when Rodgers is traded.
Dude has the longest drive as a QB in Chiefs history.  Edit:Post season history!
The ACLs would explode like the ending of Kingsman
Lol that’s how his list looks. He won’t admit white QBs are better than him, so he lists only black QBs that are injury prone, which is most of them, and then sprinkles a few white guys in to look better or more serious, but have injury history or similar play styles.
Watson is not as mobile, but he’s not exactly far off from Allen or Hurts either, and Watson literally never fucking stops scrambling because he has 0 pocket presence.  Which is also probably why he takes a billion sacks
I don’t know if half of the people here don’t have ears but he clearly states the reason for most guys on that list and the guys on the list who weren’t already a part of C1N have a similar playstyle to him or are just guys that he probably likes
You need data that suggests getting tackled raises your chance of injury?
35 touchdowns 7 interceptions in his last full season and one of the best passer ratings in league history   He’s a pretty great player and 5-6 games last year isn’t indicative of what he can do
I’m specifically saying I don’t see him as an upgrade over those guys, but those would be the very limited QBs I could see people making an argument over at best. I couldn’t have worded it any more sensitively to avoid offending some fans
He was prior to the murders, among the most popular celebrities/former athletes in the country.  I mean on a smaller scale, look at the shit Peyton Manning did at Tennessee and how beloved he became and still is
Now that we've established you're a casual, you can continue to spew your casual takes
Yeah Dobbs played as well as you possibly could’ve expected him to. He was also essentially playing with out practice squad o line as well. Was nice to see as a Vols fan
Him being a project QB doesn’t change the fact that his performances were well below what is expected from being a project quarterback
I don't mean this offensively, but your flair is the last I expected to see after reading a comment like this lol.   After Trevor Siemian, Paxton Lynch, and Drew Lock back to back to back I would think you of all people would believe the concept of a project QB is a myth lmao  I sure as hell can't give any credence to the idea, we've had nothing but awful QBs except the butt oil guy (and Matt Schaub had a couple underrated years).
It's more that this sub for a long time pointed to Rodgers success and Mahomes success and made "sitting a year or two" into this magic formula that could turn anyone into a franchise qb.  Hell, people were arguing Kizer could've been good if he had sat.  The sentiment still exists, but people are starting to realize that Mahomes and Rodgers are outliers more than anything.
Only by the sports media and those that believed the click bait. Anyone who watched any tape of him against anything resembling an actual defender saw right through that
I loved when he said that. Everyone was on his nuts like Farve didn’t do that to Rodgers and Rodgers didn’t do that Love lol.
Zach Wilson just needs better support and a good OC and passing coordinator/QB coach.
If you’re going to whine, be weird about it, and/or not add anything of value, why comment?
Lol they were praying on our downfall and hoping we’d be stupid enough to take that trashbucket because hE cOuLd Be ThE nExT lAmAr!!! 🥴🥴🥴. Then a bunch of people were saying that Willis was better because he was black and that we needed a black QB to take us to victory. Lol as if a QBs race has anything to do with his performance.
He was hot trash at Liberty. He left being the 5th string QB at Auburn because he knew he couldn’t hack it. So he played in D3 and ran a shit ton because he knew he couldn’t throw well. Even against low tier college guys. You need to separate the passing stats from the rushing stats lmao. He got 2857 yards through the air. That’s fucking trash. He’s a player who couldn’t start at a good program because of the expectations and competition and went to shorty school.
"I want to work with my friends because that would be more fun."  It doesn't seem out of the ordinary that Cam might just have more black friends which would bias his selection towards having more black QBs on his list.
It’s not but my race has never been disenfranchised and abused on anywhere near levels black people have; I have no legitimate reasons other than racism to prefer one person or the other based on the color of their skin. Thanks for proving my point
Both good guesses, but no. It's a Kid Cudi song.  I was real into him when I made this account lol
This is why I went to the shield and never looked back.   "Rape is bad"  "Oh yeah? Well the Cowboys...."   Fuck that
Shit like this makes it worse for discussing situations where there actually *is* racial prejudice at play.  For those keeping score, Cam has:  - made a misogynist comment directed toward a woman interviewing him (funny to hear a woman talk about *routes*) - made a misogynist comment on a podcast (a woman should "know how to cater to their man" and "know when to be quiet") - expressed admiration for Deshaun Watson *as a person* in the year *2023*.  These are only things he has said and done *in public*.  It is not racist to say Cam Newton is a misogynist. If he were white and saying this shit, guess what? Still misogynist.
>He told co-hosts Gillie Da King and Wallo that a “bad b----” cannot cook and “you don’t know when to be quiet.”  I remember this interview but holy shit I forgot how bad it was
[removed]
They're basically maniacs who spend all of their time lifting heavy things and getting hit in the head. I love football and I love a lot of players, but I don't really take any of these dudes seriously outside of football context.
Something about Tannehill is just really forgettable
Your comment has a certain stink to it
I’m fragile but this comment  section is having a meltdown over Cam Newton saying where he’d prefer to play as a BACKUP lmfao  y’all only have a problem with it because Cam is black
No way did he really?
I mean Rodgers is almost 40 and has had injuries. Allen hasn’t had an injuries but runs a style similar to what Cam ran earlier in his career (higher risk of injury) and Howell is in DC with his old coach. All seem to have a somewhat logical route that ends up with Cam under center at somepoint. And the 4 black QB’s he DIDN’T mention in Dak, Geno, Russ, and Pat run more pass offensives that Cam’s arm is too cooked to play in.
Which is crazy because pocket awareness was one of his better traits in college and early on with Houston.
“He’s not exactly far off from 2 out of the 3 best running QBs in the game”  Bruh,…cmon…..
Well when the actual data says that QBs are injured on a higher percentage of plays from the pocket than plays as a runner, I'd say it's worth taking into account
Which was like 3 years ago at this point.  It's dumb to look at that say "Yea he's still up there".  He's trash until he proves otherwise.
*allegedly*  /s  But seriously if the Manning stuff happened today it’d be a much bigger deal. It also should be mentioned that there’s a lot of… opacity on *what* exactly happened and that neither the accuser nor the accused appears to be that trustworthy on the matter.  **That said, if Manning did straight up sexually assault a trainer, then fuck him forever.**
Right. Project QBs don’t look Ryan Lindley bad. A QB off the street should not outperform you when you’ve had all offseason.   Not expecting greatness, but a minimal level f being able to complete passes.
Yep, then they conveniently leave out examples like Josh Allen who was super raw coming into the league and started immediately and developed just fine.  I used to be one of those people who thought QBs should sit and learn, but then Deshaun (oof) changed that line of thinking real quick.
Yeah but it was also pushed by those that are supposed to be the “smarter” people in sports media. You had the Mina Kimes and Nate Tice of the world saying “He might be an alien, could he be the next Josh Allen?” lmao it was getting ridiculous
It's hard to take your opinion seriously when you think Liberty is a D3 school.
>I have no legitimate reasons other than racism to prefer one person or the other based on the color of their skin  There are no legitimate reasons.
I was absolutely addicted to that album when it came out, still holds up well too. I think I spent the majority of my freshman year in college listening to Man on the Moon and Operation: Doomsday
Some people either make it about your team for no reason or random people will just jump in to shit talk your team and add nothing else to the discussion.  It's really annoying and I'm contemplating making the switch myself.
Exactly. It accomplishes nothing and only serves to hurt whatever cause they are fighting for.  Dr. Martin Luther King said he had a dream that people would someday be judged based on the content of their character rather than the color of their skin.  Dismissing opinions and criticisms of a person simply because they are black accomplishes the opposite of what Dr. King wanted.

Did you know how played for Miami?!
I'm not sure I've ever seen an interview with him.
Ya against the jags in a divisional postseason game 98yards
*Postseason history.  98 yards vs the Jags this year  https://twitter.com/ESPNStatsInfo/status/1616935180589056000
Postseason history, yeah
Yeah he just kinda gave up lol. Which weirdly worked because he’s among the best in the league at scrambling and somehow usually doesn’t get demolished. It’s incredibly infuriating how he’s so bad at pocket presence and yet somehow it really didn’t impact his play. It does not make a lick of sense how he does it but somehow, it works.   Except against the steelers. His scrambling did not work against them
So you think that getting hit like a running back has the same affect on the body as getting hit in the pocket? Do running qbs last as long in the nfl as pocket passers? So when dak trashed his ankle as a runner and missed an entire year, then hurt his finger and leg in the pocket later in his career, he got hurt in the pocket at a higher percentage, but the one running play fucked him up much worse. So maybe the percentage in the pocket is higher, but clearly getting hit as a runner takes a larger toll on your body.
Like people say about Lamar Jackson, oh he was 2019 mvp. Yes he was but nothing since just like Watson nothing since
Didn’t play 2021 and only played 6 games 2022  Also his play even before 2020 proves he’s likely better than those 6 games last year  We gotta watch him this year to see if he’s still that guy though
I suspect that unfortunately, athletes like Watson and Peyton Manning are far more common than we like to think
Project QBs don't have to look bad at all, they can still be good in their own weird way. Rookie Lamar Jackson was a hilariously broken player but his positive impact was undeniable.
Even Allen didn't take off until year 3.
There’s weren’t many other good QBs so every GM was praising him and leaking rumors to build up his hype
Brett Kollman rode him hard going into the draft.
I know it’s a D2 school I’m just talking shit lol. But everything I’ve said is factual. There won’t be a pumping of any brakes. The guy is trash.
There are certainly legitimate reasons for any black man in America to have any degree of distrust or apprehension towards any white person
Lmao do whatever you want just don't sign Greg Hardy again you ASSHOLE.
What a fucking ridiculous take.  People are racist because they're critical of black athletes now? Are we not allowed to have opinions about black players anymore? Are we only allowed to be critical of white players?  You're just looking for any little excuse to label people racist so you can dismiss their opposing opinions rather than face the fact that you might just be wrong.
Let's both root for Cam Newton to land back on your team. I might buy gamepass or some shit to see your Cam lead a team to some horrendous record and you slurp it up.
For 7 years and has gotten 2 $100 million contracts in his career
yeah too bad that sentiment applies to a whopping zero comments in this thread though
What is up with your flairs?! That seems sacrilegious
The dudes been busy with the off field stuff and sat out a year, not surprised he looked pretty mediocre last season.   Very interested to see how he looks this upcoming season. It’s another poor year of play, that contract is looking worse than it did initially.
Look I'm not here to relitigate studies that have been done on this. Basically the difference is that in the pocket QBs are vulnerable and they're focused on reading the field and making a pass while as a runner they're paying attention to bracing for hits and protecting themselves. It goes against conventional wisdom for sure, but that's what the data says. QBs take serious injuries at a higher rate in the pocket than they do as a ball carrier. You brought up Dak, but look at someone like Lamar who has also missed significant time from injuries he took in the pocket, not from injuries sustained while running. Josh Allen is the same as well, he hasn't been seriously hurt running but he has in the pocket
Bruh getting hit hard in the NFL at all can fuck you up, doesn't matter if you're in the pocket or not. Especially when it's a defensive lineman thats most likely hitting you when you're in the pocket vs on the run where your more likely to be tackled by a defensive back or a linebacker.
If he had missed all that time due to injury, you wouldn't be making this argument.  He didn't play for 2 years and then stunk it up when he finally got back on the field.  Nobody cares what he did 3 years ago.   The NFL is a "what have you done for me lately" league. So he's trash until he proves otherwise.
Yep. I remember Brad Holmes was asked about him after the draft and he said something along the lions of: “He went right about where we thought he’d go.”
Yeah but that’s kinda my point. There’s a sect of football analysts that like to position themselves as smarter or more thoughtful than the average talking head. They embrace tape breakdowns and analytics etc.   And yet they were hyping up Malik Willis all off-season. If you buy their brand, they’re supposed to be above falling for the typical smokescreens lol
I Iike Kollman videos more when he’s breaking down why things are going wrong or right for a team in season. I really enjoyed his video showing why my Vikings defense couldn’t defense.
Are there reasons for any white man in America to have any degree of distrust or apprehension towards any black person?
Any white person you suspect may be racist towards *you*, sure. But any white person, *period*? Yeah, that's fucking racist bro.
Lol let’s play the “jump to conclusions” game. You’ve already got a head start.   What do you call it when he is being judged based on a single game out of 11 years of play?   Please, enlighten me.  Nobody is saying he’s a starting caliber QB, and you conflating the issue is either you arguing in bad faith, being too ignorant to actually read, or something else entirely.   The issue is him being judged for a single play and post conference, 15 minutes of his professional career, and not *his entire body of work prior and post.*   You being to ignorant to understand the prompt has nothing to do with me “dismissing opinions,” exactly like you’re doing right now.
>No reason to slander him as having ego issues when the dude **career is already in the gutter.**  Wow ready comprehension is hard. This has nothing to do with him being a starting caliber QB, but rather the fact that he’s called a “diva” or “egotistical” or whatever fucking false narrative is being pushed *based on 1 game out of an 11 year career.*   Yeah totally fair criticism.
some people just like to watch the world burn
So you think running qbs last as long as pure pocket passers in the NFL?
Alright bruh running qbs aren’t at a higher risk for injury and destruction to their bodies, they last just as long as pocket qbs in the nfl. Using your qb as a running back isn’t dangerous at all. I dont know why this is a controversial opinion to some of y’all lol using your qb as a running back multiple plays a game puts him at a higher risk for injury vs someone who’s just in the pocket, we’ve seen running qbs exit the league incredibly early. The guys who last long are pocket passers. Why is this controversial??
Nah he'll always be trash
Lol simmer down bro the guy isn’t even arguing with you why you so heated
Wait, you’re telling us that *Nike*, of all companies, couldn’t correctly match the color of a professional sports team for a *decade*?
Wish Nike would fix our green too
“This is not a redesign. This is a color correction to bring our uniforms more in line with our true color - process blue. When Nike took us on in 2012, they chose the color in their color book that was closest to our blue. They now have a better color match. - The shoulder stripe stops short of going under the armpit as part of change made by Nike to accommodate new technology related to increased mobility. - We are not removing silver. - The jerseys for our number one draft choice will reflect this updated color of blue. - we are not changing our logo - this updated blue is consistent with the blue that fans see in our end zones”
I actually like the Panthers uniforms
Sorry Panther bros. Stuck with us outdated folks holding on to that late 90s early 2000s aesthetic like it’s a Wonka Golden Ticket
'The jerseys for our number one draft choice will reflect this updated color of blue.' ...I see you snuck that one in there.
As a reminder, Nike does not color match well. At all. A lot of teams colors changed subtly in 2012 when it went from Reebok to nike.  If it were up to nike, they’d probably have done the subtle color palette update they did with the browns for every team (just making the change from their 2012-2014 uniforms directly to the 2020-current set instead of the monstrosities we wore for half a decade)
I don’t want many changes to the uniform, but certainly more than what’s suggested by Sheena’s report.
"The blue is being corrected" 🤩   "But we're not removing the silver" 🙁
I’m still convinced the Bears Blue is different from what it used to be
Whelmed
Isn't there some misquoted George W. Bush quote that goes something like "The best thing about books are the pictures." That applies here.
As a kid I was like "don't fuck with it...make an awesome home and away jersey and that's our look. People should be able to recognize our brand world wide."  Now? I feel like every era of a team should have it's own look.  When a team gets a new head coach and starting QB, they should tweak the unis. This era is different from the Cam Newton/Ron Rivera era and the Matt Rhule/Teddy Bridgewater era. We should be able to visually tell it.
Lame
YESSSS
Phew that’s a relief
Great, they're keeping the 90s look. I was so excited to see those colors in an updated look. Booo.
Yes. I mean, they still can’t. Nike even said when they first took over that they couldn’t match green well. The Eagles shade of green is still different now than it was under Reebok, and they flat out had the eagles wear Reebok cuts and then black for half a season because they couldn’t match it. It’s probably why the packers wear mesh still, and the green on those packers game jerseys does not match what you get when you buy a replica lol.  And I mean, those are the obvious ones. I mean it’s out there and pretty obvious that they still can’t match the shade of bluish grey that the cowboys used on their pants during the Reebok era, and they’re on their second attempt. Denver’s orange looks like it changed a bit, detroits light blue changed, the colts blue definitely changed, jacksonvilles teal changed, the rams flat out lost their true gold pants, miamis aqua changed and they lost their aqua pants the saints gold changed, the jets green changed etc. and that’s just in 2012  Nike is HORRIBLE with color matching, it’s why especially in college, teams just flat out change shades when the flip companies.   It’s part of the reason a TON of teams have made uniform edits or updated colors
didn’t they do the same thing with the eagles’ green, but only for a few years?
Apparently the companies own the individual hues of color (or however it’s properly worded).  Stupid.
Lakers fans currently crying
They were distracted trying to keep up with Oregons uni demands.
Color is clearly an NFT
They couldn’t match the SEC team I worked with for shit. Eventually we had to change helmet shades to get closer to Nike’s coloration. We’d have four years of helmets in all different shades.
Apart from the eagles fuck up, they haven’t been matching metallic helmet colours to pants for the same time. Some like the saints gave up and switched to black or white, but then you have the 49ers or cowboys who we wear this weird fake gold or silver
Seriously. I want to go to Kelly Green just in part so we can get away from the fake teal green they keep saying is midnight.
I’ve always thought you guys had the best looking jerseys in the league tbh
Maybe I'm crazy but we won it all in this green. I want it forever
Seems crazy that a company like Nike couldn’t match a teams color. And even crazier that it took the panthers this long to make a correction.
Can we get a side by side?
Serious question, how is it that a billion dollar company can’t get the correct shades for professional sports teams?
I’m very surprised how the sudden consensus is that “Broncos panthers cardinals and browns all need new uniforms”  I can’t tell if I have no taste or the Reddit echo chamber is truly turned up to 11.
On the bright side I never feel pressured to drop 100 dollars on an ugly jersey I'll never want to wear in public
I hope we never change   Hornets should have kept the 90s logo and uniforms too. I think there was trademark issues with the logo and New Orleans though   Charlotte basically didn’t become a major city until the 90s anyways
Eh, the Pats' redesign a few years back was minor but a huge upgrade imo
this line just raises the question of whether the jerseys for every other player *won't* reflect the change
But the brown remains unchanged…
Laaaaaammee
Almost every teams colors look different now
The patriots are a whole ass region. I like the way it is, “The Charlotte Panthers” just doesn’t roll off the tongue like Carolina does.
honestly it just seems like Phil Knight or whoever was like we're fucking Nike, use the colors we already have , then we can make bank off a redesign when it's convenient. I still can't explain the banana yellow Laker jersey situation tho
>	Nike is HORRIBLE with color matching, it’s why especially in college, teams just flat out change shades when the flip companies.  As a lakers fan, the purple and “gold” Nike uses is just awful
I always feel like I’m taking crazy pills over the lions current blue. It looks faded to me.
They still have the Lakers wearing banana yellow and it’s so frustrating
I would love to hear from someone familiar with what all goes into it that makes it so difficult to match a color on a jersey.  Is it simply a matter of them having a shit ton of dyes and not quite coming up with the correct mixture or whatever? How much does the fabric play into it? Just curious.
the lakers' jerseys have been bright yellow, not gold for like 5 years now
They still have never been able to correctly get the eagles green. Eagles look almost blue-green now when they were very clearly green before
Yup.  Nike fucking blows when it comes to jerseys.  Remember when they made the new nba jerseys around 2017 and they were ripping apart in games?
Hamlindigo blue
Apparently they have trouble with green, so they’d probably fuck up Kelly green too
I like the new midnight green. Just comes down to the era you grew up with.
You'll take the orange and blue and you'll like it  We need to have an all-Pennsylvania classic with the orange and blue Eagles vs. the bumblebee (or Batman) Steelers on Thursday night football
Have you seen the Lakers “gold” since Nike took over?   [Before](https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/200824175931-kobe-bryant-file.jpg?q=w_2500,h_3758,x_0,y_0,c_fill)  [After](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRaEDE_3TfGqvoeIBX4p1e1QDoMzSDfJ_tQbg&usqp=CAU)
The Eagles once went half a season without green jerseys because Nike didn't have the color.
I think the Panthers uniforms are awesome looking, nothing really screams outdated about them to me.  The Cardinals though in my opinion have been due for a refresh.
Panthers unis are okay imo, same with Browns. Broncos and Cards really do need new unis, especially Broncos.  Houston also badly needed new unis and should have been included on the Reddit hivemind list but we’re getting new ones next year thankfully. I guess not being noticed was the point of going bland err I mean “traditional” with the design as Bob mcNair called it
Especially after the short stretch of the ugly ass jerseys they gave the browns, the ones they have currently are far better.
cardinals definitely do, this has been a pretty common sentiment for years. broncos and panthers are meh and could probably use a tune up. browns are perfect and should not change anything
Most of the buzz around the Broncos started when the owners sent out a fan survey gauging how the fan base felt about new unis
Cardinals are getting new ones this year finally they’re pretty outdated lol. Browns uniforms are dope as hell. Panthers uniforms are pretty cool, I wish they would do the helmets more blue though. And then Broncos uniforms I just don’t like at all, blue and orange is a horrendous color scheme imo
When I think of the 90s, I think of the Hornets colors.
They are just so bland. Not a fan of them.
I always thought they were a bit bland but I recently realized that they are basically an updated version of their old red one. I thought that was kinda cool
Couldn't disagree more. The Pats redesign stinks of corporatized bland garbage. Just like the SB logos from XLV-LIII (minus 50) and the draft logo since 2005.   Pats 2000s unis weren't as good as the Pat Patriot years, but they at least had character. Their current ones suck balls.
Maybe so.. Seems like good marketing to sell jerseys to me.
Yeah even that I’m not really sure about lol. It definitely looks like our brown changed between 2011 and 2012
Yeah I can’t really explain the banana yellow lakers jersey either lol. They’ve done a proper dark yellow with Michigan and Iowa in recent years lol.  On the flip side, despite the Cavs having yellow jerseys for a while, they never made a yellow Cavs city jersey when cleveland still used yellow instead of metallic gold so I guess they do have issues lol
Kelly green’s supposed to be coming back this year if I remember right.
They just used reeboks old green
they fucked up our old hunter green for half a decade too. fortunately they made up for it with our current uni shade
I grew up with the Kelly green (I remember when they had White helmets with green wings) but now like the modern uniform better.  Happy to see them roll out Kelly for a game or two but for full time I think the current uniform looks better.
its yellow and blue. You're also talking to the wrong fan cause I loved them ugly jawns
The chargers current “powder blue” seems substantially darker than the one they used for throwbacks in the past
Wow maybe this is a big issue never i realized that's y I disliked the lakers new jerseys without even realizing
Holy shit that’s bad lol
When we switched our helmets didn't match our jerseys for like 6 years before it finally got fixed
How does Nike fuck that one up when they’ve definitely made Lakers sneakers & apparel in the proper gold
looks better now lol
Call me crazy but After >>>>> Before
I hate how much they fucked up the new Lakers jerseys.  Detest that banana yellow garbage.
i just threw up what the fuck
They still don’t have the color right it’s been a decade and that midnight green is absolutely still not the same color as the gorgeous one they first had
I‘ve seen hobby football clubs with more refined uniforms than the Cardinals
I don’t mind the Broncos but the Cardinals jerseys really look awful even though they have wonderful colors and a cool logo
90s cup is the same colors
Respectfully disagree - the 95-99 design with the vertical Patriot logo is the undisputed non-Pat champ  edit: lol dude accused me of downvoting and then blocked me? this place gets weirder and weirder by the day.
Because we never won dick in those Kelly green uniforms.
nike just sucks at jerseys in general it seems
The pre redesign powder blues were the best jerseys in league history  Hope they roll them out as throwbacks one day. Can’t wait to see Herbert rocking them.
I think that's deliberate. It matches the modern logos/branding.
You crazy but to each their own I guess
This also causes stock issues for them. I haven’t bought a jersey in a while but look occasionally. Every time of the year I’d ever be tempted they’re sold out in most sizes, and frankly a lot of the time around the year.
FWIW department: Birds won the NFL Championship over Lombardi and the Packers wearing the Kelly greens.
Nike just sucks in general and I don’t know why people obsess about their shit.
They do, and you can *really* see it in soccer leagues where there's not a leaguewide deal.
[MFW you actually call me crazy after I told you to call me crazy](https://i.gifer.com/1MKt.gif)
Yeah, they don’t know how to prioritize stock either lol. They ran out of some of our most popular players jerseys last year but don’t worry, they had plenty of Deshaun Watson jerseys, which um, sold about as well as you’d expect.  I still feel bad for the poor Dicks employee working the “fan gear” section who was very visibly frustrated by the number of times he was asked if they had any non Watson jerseys in the 5ish minutes that I was shopping in the Nike and Guardians sections lol.
downvoted
*didn’t win dick in the Super Bowl era. FTFY
Because Jordan.
right its the same with us, ive been wanting one of those mitchell and ness steve smith jerseys for the longest and they havent had it in my size for months. all of the most stocked jerseys for the panthers are jerseys for players that arent on the team anymore (cmc, dj, 2018 qbs)
Fixed it for yourself, not me
Elons son: “Finally, some fucking representation”
Zach Wilson as QB 2b would be pretty iconic
i barely have the motivation to get up in the morning
I would accept it if they allowed the Cam Newton font.
Looking forward to seeing a receiver room with 0O, 00, O0, OO.
I’ll accept up to and including three term expressions, but it’s a hard no on equations.
No rioting but I’d shit my pants
I'd stop watching entirely.  First kneeling, now different numbers.   Just more woke bullshit.  Go woke, go broke  /s
“😤$” would be my number
I'd get F5 just for threads like this
X-wing @ Aliciousness - Missouri Western State University
I would commit genocide
It’d be hard for the announcers and sound awkward.
80085
Limit it to hex only. Simple.
I want fractions instead like futurama
It's an inevitability with retired numbers
I would bomb the nfl head quarters before that happens. It should be numbers with triple digits.
Elon Musk's kid could have the same name & jersey number
The big brain move is changing your number to an entire mathematical expression so the other team hesitates mid play to read the full number.
About as many that rioted when they added sponsors to the jerseys
F4 would be nicknamed Phantom.
All we wanted was for players to put names like “HE HATE ME” on the back of their jerseys and this is what we get instead?
I'd support hexadecimal, but that's as far as I'll go.
they should just let players wear whatever number they want from 0 to infinity
*Cam Newton nods in approval*
Give someone on injured reserve 4F.
I’m buying the jersey off the person who chooses pie
I only accept FB wearing 2Y
0O
I’d want the players to change their number every game so we can get some bingo going.
I'm all for it.  I just want to hear gronk try to pronounce avogadro's number.
Riot? No. I'd say "Well that's fucking stupid" and eventually get used to it.
So in rugby it's quite rigid and everyone has to wear 1-15 and its position specific  But back in the day Leicester and Bristol both wore letters of the alphabet instead of numbers.   Combining them making some kind of excel spreadsheet of a team is too much.  My most boomer take is 0 is against God and Nature. If they introduce 00 I'm going to refuse to acknowledge the NFL exists
Bill Belichick would get very creative and have 2 players who look alike and one be 8rnn and 8rnm and 8m  or 13 and I3 and just B   10 and 1O
Rioting isn’t really my style
I would literally drink like two non-alcoholic beers.
Depends. When you say "full range" are we talking about the latin alphabet only or can we throw in some greek, hebrew, cyrillic or arab letters too?
Riot? Out of anger they hadn’t done it?  Nephews man
Hmm, would I rather have an imaginary or irrational number?
I don't give a shit about numbers now and wouldn't care at all if they added letters. I watch for the sport, not the decorations.
Take the names OFF!
Take the names OFF!
MLB did a players weekend a few years ago where players got to pick fun names on the back of their jersey.  there is a pitcher whose last name is Boxburger.  that became 📦 🍔
Is his number k9 cause he’s got that dog in him

hieroglyphs, let's go. You need to go on a scavenger hunt to find the Rosetta stone to figure out what Ochocinco's number and legal name is now
Players weekend in the MLB was fun AF and I hope they bring it back.  I wouldnt mind if the NFL did something like that for one preseason week or something.
Cam Newton would be furious
As a uni nerd and sports aesthetics nerd, I *would* be one of the rioters. Already have my "break incase of massive uniform failure" pitchfork at the ready
I’d prefer if they went with hexadecimals myself
Need a & jersey
Imagine seeing !! running towards you
They should trial-run player signatures on the nameplate instead of just block lettering.
I'd be fine with emoji "numbers."  It would make the ref calling them out for a penalty fun.
French here :  I could riot for that too. Wouldn't change my day.
let’s see roman numerals first
Just make them excel formulas.
Dibs on Æ
I'd be pretty annoyed. It's already hard enough to keep track of what people's numbers are
God this comment is so underrated 😭😭😭
His mom just changed his name to "?"  I'm not kidding look it up.
More like "not 2b"
More like 9S cause he sucks
Seriously... I do my shit to come home and drink myself to sleep most days
Seriously, life is overwhelming and I have zero fucks to give about what identifiers go on jerseys.   Go wild. Break out the Greek alphabets. Get a Pokémon endorsement and throw on different versions of Unown. Pull some runes from Diablo. It all works.
Only the Cam Newton font.

You know the NFL would block stuff like TT and PP.
Numbers are very rarely retired, it’s gonna take a long ass time before there aren’t enough numbers.

What about "?"
L7 weenie
So much the same. I’m just trying to get through this shit on a daily basis so I can go home and forget about it too.   I care less about NFL players numbers than if my boss gave me a different work uniform number every day.  “I’m number 47 today? Ok. Still done at 5, right? Sounds good.”
Damn dude. Life can be a struggle sometimes for sure but try to break that cycle while you can. Not trying to get deep but I read this and was like yea I feel you but also don't do that to yourself if you can help it lol. Hang in there man.. I hope you ride out these tough times and things start going smoother for you soon.
cheers brother. saves me from the crippling sleep anxiety.
jah eth ber on a jersey would make me so happy. i love enigma.
Pokemon and NFL football are two of the three things I genuinely care about in this life. If they combined in any meaningful way, I'll have finally arrived at Shangri-La.   Now if on top of that they added RDR2 elements in some way...... then that would mean I'd finally arrived at Shangri-La 2: Electric Boogaloo.
Only if he plays in Houston/Tennessee
I just threw up in my mouth
Lol
Let's see fast math....32 teams x 53 players = 1696 numbers required. 156 numbers have been retired since 1939 so an average of 1.88 numbers retired per year...0-99 gives 100 possible numbers per team x 32 = 3200 possible numbers. 3200-1696=1504 numbers may be retired before system change needed. 1504÷1.88= 800 years.
and at that point they’d probably just start un-retiring some older numbers
Their account got suspended lmao
You do realize you responded 13+ hours later, when the upvotes have changed since the time he made that comment  and 10 other dumbasses upvoted you at the time of my comment
that is the question (mark)
meh respect his life expectancy. some of us want to live how we want and not til 70 or 60.
Get this. A game where go around like Pokemon, but instead of monsters it is NFL players you are collecting.      Then you train them up and get into match with others that have done the same things.      Cool thing it, to keep the mentions of slavery or racism down, the NFL player are droids. Bonus, the robots could get really terrifying looking injuries that 5 minutes with a screw gun can fix.
Literally sharia law smh
This is why I always turn to u/chubbytitties for my math needs.
My comment was still easily the most upvoted part of this thread at the time that reply came in. Maybe not quite 4x the post at that point but yeah it certainly wasn’t underrated as far as upvotes go.   Surprised just how harsh the reaction from everyone was tho
Ok that still doesn’t make that persons comment any less dumb considering they didn’t know that?
This is such a dumb hill to die on btw, dumb enough that I’m just gonna assume you’re the original guy that got downvoted because literally nobody else would (or should) care this much lol.  But yeah given that your reply already had downvotes when the other guy replied to it, he could reasonably assume that the downvotes were because the OG comment wasn’t underrated at the time of your reply.
I really don’t care lol, if you can’t understand what I’m saying that’s on you bro
I understand exactly what you’re trying to say, I just think it’s dumb as fuck and irrelevant.   And keep telling yourself you don’t care “bro”. You’re the one who came here on a second account to try to clear your name
NFCN bookends.
NFCN cap master class (and the Vikings)
This will all look very different post June 1st
Look at all of this cap space that we have that Gute is doing fuck all with.
I love our GM
Vikings what is you doing
With $3.5 mil cap space (and 4th from the bottom), I’m pretty sure we can sign like four more ex-Patriots. FML and fuck McDaniels.
I honestly have no clue how we still have the second most cap.
Cinci could add $12,604,000 by trading Jonah Williams.  That'd take it up to over $29 mil. Cinci would eat some of this most likely though. Plus, Cinci supposedly may move him to RT anyway. Never know..
PSA: cap space can be created by restructuring contracts and teams are more willing than ever to do that.  Every "cap space" post needs to be accompanied by a leverage metric that measures the amount a team is spending on base salary vs pro-rated bonuses.  The higher the leverage, the more tilted a team is towards bonuses. The lower it is, the more tilted a team is towards base salary. Base salaries can be converted to pro-rated bonuses that temporarily create cap space. Meaning- low cap space accompanied by low leverage isnt that bad, etc.  Example: the Vikes are lowest on cap space. Then you look at Brian O'Neill's contract and realize it's very under-levered and you can reasonably make 8 mil in cap space with a salary conversion. You can extend TJ Hockenson and create 5-6 mil easily. Etc.  Another useful thing to report along with cap space is cash spend and cash-to-cap ratios.
I dont know how it happened that we kept so many players while having 20M cap space, except Howie things.   There's only 2 reasons for our cap space; big move incoming, or early Hurts extension to accelerate some of the cap hit.
Wow, a salary cap post that doesn’t dog on the Saints and question every level and member of the front office. What a genuine breath of fresh air!
I assume this includes projected cap hits for incoming draft picks?
Bears at the top with $500M still to go
Woo not last
And topheavy.
We be shoppin’
>Look at all of this cap space that we have that ~~Gute~~Ballard is doing fuck all with.
I was led to believe our cap was fucked lol, does this leave out Rodgers or something?
He’s been making money moves!
Lions have been making really smart moves. Signing good but affordable players, not borrowing money from the future when they weren't quite ready to go all-in, drafting well, and not necessarily *building* around Goff but understanding that he is good enough to get the Lions where they want to be right now. They're headed in the right direction.
Basically, most of us have waited a lifetime for this guy.
The 1-year deals have been fantastic versus throwing big money long-term deals around and the FA not working out.
Waiting for Dalvin to get healthy so he can pass a physical and be traded.
Said this in another post, but these cap space numbers are not very meaningful nowadays.  Teams can rapidly create cap space if they have the cash to convert base salaries to bonuses. So what really matters is how many "workable" contracts a team has that make it easy to generate cap space (and whether they have the cash to pay bonuses up front). A workable contract in my mind is one that has at least 3ish years remaining, a high base salary #, and its a player you think youll want to keep for a while anyway.  The Vikings have Brian O'Neill on a highly workable contract that can produce ~$8 mil in cap space overnight. TJ Hockeson can also create space. Dalvin Cook is cuttable/tradable.  That said, they also have a ton of dead money, so Im not trying to argue that the Vikes are in wonderland. What Im trying to point out is that raw cap numbers obscure a lot of important stuff.
This worked really well for Detroit
That’s what’s trash about these patriot asshole coaches. They always think they are so close to competing but just need “their guys”. When in reality it’s their ego and dickhead philosophy that holds the team back as a whole.
I hear there's a mid 40 year old available.
Well, you don't have a too QB, or RB, or WR that you're using a lot of cap on.
They could also potentially get as much as $10M by cutting Mixon.
But who is going to trade for Jonah Williams for 12,604,000 and picks
I'm not sure any team trades for  him without the Bengals eating some of that hit. He had a pretty poor season( although injury had a big part if it) and not many teams have 12 million spare for 1 player (and the rececing team wouldn't be able to restructure that hit due to this being his last contract year)
He is 99.9% going to be our RT this coming year.
You guys did lose Hargraves, johnson, semalu, sanders, and both your starting linebackers in fairness
Your QB accounts for 4mil of your cap instead of 25-50 mil like most teams, it's not rocket science.
Except for the part they have no long term solution at QB, limited draft capital (thank goodness they were able to trade Payton), and keep bleeding free agents while not getting any closer to a Super Bowl. Oh and they haven't even *started* to rebuild yet. But yeah sure, they're totally fine.
The first time I've seen somebody use "top heavy" properly in r/NFL. Usually people will claim the less top teams there are, the more "top heavy" the league is
Rodgers being traded will put an additional 8M on the books. So we have 15M ish.  Then you add in the rookie cap hits at 8M or so. So Gute has 7M~ to play around with.  Which isn't a lot. They like to keep 5M or so for the season for emergency signings if there's an injury.
Martin Mayhew almost cooked, but the old rookie contracts cooked him
Yeah but McDaniels is actually a really good OC, whereas Patricia just worked for Bill. Afaik Flores is the only ex DC of theirs to go elsewhere and be good, Daboll is killing it but he's offense.
Agreed. As much as I like Mixon, this just makes sense.
He is a LT though. There's got to be some team out there that has a need. You're right tho. Cicni will most likely eat some of that.
Hey if there’s one thing we Midwesterner’s know, it’s being too heavy
That makes sense to me though. A few overpowered teams at the top and more bad teams at the bottom = top heavy. The top is dense and the bottom is weak
Might be hard to imagine, but things can have different meanings in different regions.
It can add even more than 8m I believe, depending on t How everything shakes out
I dont think this gets enough credit, with todays contracts, suh on a rookie deal with stafford (i believe 5th year option woulda been suhs rookie year) and megatron, that team would have had a shit ton of cap space and 3 of the best players in our fanchises history.
I’m pretty sure Patricia had one of the best defensive calls In Super Bowl history.  Checkmate Atheists!
Is he though? He was hot fucking garbage with the Rams. He’s hot fucking garbage in Las Vegas. Looks to me he’s more of a system coach under Emperor Belichick
I think they'll roll with Mixon even with the savings there. The Bengals usually let players earn the full value of their contracts (just like they expect players to honor their full contract).  They might not announce deals as large, but players can usually earn every dollar.
The question is where would they spend that money post draft? Not going to be a lot of players left at our positions of need.
There really aren't a ton of teams that *need* a left tackle right now, right tackle is in much shorter supply this season so far
If there’s not a lot of teams at the top then it’s not dense tho lol
Top heavy has its definition in the statement, though. It means there's more in the top than the bottom
That’s the problem with FatMattPat, he thinks he made a great defensive call when in reality, Seahawks shit the bed.
Bill was not and has never been an offensive playcaller. McDaniels is one of the very best in the game, even if his play designs are a little old school. He probably did inherit the FB love from Bill. I actually think him and Scott Turner are gonna be a good pairing for u guys, I just wish it was someone other than Jimmy operating it.
"Well....he's on.... the team right now...."
Cap rolls over though, can front load some of the Burrow deal when that happens.
Density is different than quantity. More talent packed in = dense
It means the highest point has more weight than the rest. Don't pretend like you have a more literal or true definition, you're not weighing anything its all metaphorical. I could argue that 75% of the NFC being at the top isn't "top heavy", its just heavy.  Where I am from, using top heavy in the context of sports, the weight is not number of teams, its power/talent of the teams.  Example: The SEC is top heavy, Alabama and Georgia are 1 & 2 while the rest of the conference is unranked. The talent disparity is an upside-down pyramid, with Alabama and Georgia's talent out weighing the rest of the conference.
Maybe having the GOAT QB and top 3 ATG at TE masked a lot of deficiencies. Bill still dictated the overall picture. McDaniels has yet to prove himself on his own.

Because fuck em. That's why.
The one thing I can think of beyond potential trade leverage with whoever is picking two is this:  Let's say the Panthers are all in on CJ Stroud and make it clear he's their pick.  Then, hypothetically news comes out that makes CJ Stroud undraftable (health concerns, off field issues, etc.). The Panthers would then pivot to take Young number 1. Young now knows he was "Plan B" and you're starting the relationship with your franchise QB on the wrong foot.  Again this is hypothetical and doesn't have to do with Stroud or Young specifically, but it's an example I can foresee that justifies withholding information. There's nothing truly gained out of announcing the pick early.   In a different world, imagine the Panthers announced they were taking Jalen Carter before his off field issues. It puts them in a tough spot and it's an uncomfortable position for whoever they take in his place.
Generating drama and interest in the draft is in the league's interest.
Fuck other teams up.  No one wants to give their competition early information to craft draft day scenarios.  You want everybody picking in the heat of the moment while you planned your pick for a month.
No reason not to and the NFL loves the drama. Idt it's actual smoke screen or the teams evaluating their options all the way up to the week before the draft, but they generally prefer to not have anything out there and let the media generate all the rumors
If you are 2 or 3 and think you still might get your guy you won't trade,but if you know who is going 1 you might trade down maybe helping out your own division by mistake.
The thought is they are trying to convince the Texans to move up to #1.
It doesn't benefit them in any way to say "we're definitely taking *insert QB* ". So why do it? Plus it keeps up the intrigue which is good for the league
Ask the Orlando Magic. Potentially to entice a crazy trade although that would be epically unlikely. Partially so they don't fully commit yet. Like say they make it clear they want Stroud. And Stroud gets injured or something that concerns them. This way they haven't upset who they then take number 1 and can claim it was their plan all along.
I 100% think the nfl doesn’t let them publish it anymore.  It gives them a ton of content and increases viewership for the draft I’m sure
In the Bears case (typical): you don't want to pick #1 cause you like where you are relative to what people's draft boards are going to be.  Bears are confident with Fields and QBs are going at the top of the draft. They could move down and get a star player at another position and recoup valuable draft capital and players.   In the Panthers case (more rare): you gave up more than you wanted to move up and want to recoup by ransoming the #1 pick but not moving too far that you don't get your QB. Panthers likely weren't getting the deal they wanted to move up and had to trade for #1. They regret having to trade DJ Moore but they probably don't feel they need the #1 to get their guy, but to guarantee one of the three QB prospects they would have had to have moved as high as #5, and #3  to guarantee Young or Stroud, knowing the Bears weren't going QB if they're willing to trade back.
Knowledge is power.  Like think about it for just a second... if the Panthers for instance told the Raiders specifically who they were drafting for a favor of knowledge later down the line... the Raiders would get a good idea of who's going to be there if they traded up to pick 3... that information could literally change the draft for them and cause them to move on pick 3 early to avoid a last second bid off... or could cause them to more heavily invest in scouting/analytics for the 1st round pick they already have (because they know the player they want isn't going to be there).  For Carolina It costs literally nothing to lie, but you can gauge how teams react to certain information and from that get an understanding of how they will draft and what it is they are looking for. That doesn't mean Carolina is just going to accept every reaction as fact... but you can still sometimes gleam and idea of how others will pick from a well orchestrated lie.  You can also screw over divisional/conference rivals with this misinformation, as if you can get them to jump up and bid early on a spot you can leave them without the player they originally thought would be there..
They don't need to, they're just doing it because it's fun. Got to do *something* to pass the time for the next three weeks.
Gambling.   Gambling wasn't a thing that the NFL was in bed with when Goff and Jameis came out.
You have to remember a GM's #1 priority is not to win a Super Bowl, not to draft the best players, not to win the most games. All that helps of course.  A GM's number 1 priority is to always protect his own job.  Faking activity and making sure your owner sees that you "pursued all available options" is the GM equivalent of Brandon Staley calling Spanos into the locker-room and handing him the game ball when they clinched a playoff berth.  You create cover for your own ass by making every player an option and getting the greenlight from the owner for the path you end up embarking on.  Especially if you have to take a decision as big as drafting 1st overall.
How many teams have openly said a month before the draft " we are taking X "   A ton of rumors, leaks etc. May come out, but that's not the same.   Plus teams have made surprise 1st overall picks in the past.
In the theoretical that the Panthers see Young and Stroud as equal prospects, they could try to scare Houston into swapping picks with them to get their guy. This would allow Carolina to get back some capital while still getting their QB.   Now that’s not necessarily a likely scenario, but it’s an outside possibility y
Are you sure you’re remembering that correctly? There was a lot of conjecture about both of those picks before the draft. Mariota and Wentz were both possible first overall picks and neither team really gave away their selections
What everyone else said but the league makes the team make it as much as a surprise as possible for viewership and drama/interest purposes.  It’s like a memo that gets sent out.  Heard it on around the nfl pod or move the sticks I forget
Totally hypothetical example here. Let’s pretend that Panthers have decided that CJ Stroud is the guy and they already rolling out the red carpet and the media is running with it.  One day before the draft, video leaks of CJ Stroud with a behavior that is a scandal.  Maybe it’s even criminal.  Or perhaps they get some late intel from a trusted source that he has questionable character or work ethic issues but they were hidden well.  How awkward is it for for everyone involved when team decides to play it safe and pivot for Bryce Young?  Or how about after you pivot to Bryce Young, the team learns it was all false news/intel.  Now you’re gonna get those constant media hit jobs on how incompetent you are for not verifying before publicly changing your mind  Even worst is if Bryce Young was white.  Now you get those hit pieces on how you would never have pivot to another QB if the races were reversed.    Why even bother with all that potential drama?  Just draft your QB on day 1 and tell the media that he’s the guy you locked in on months ago.  And the scandals for the next qb never factored into your choice.  Say it was Just a pure football decision
So that every other team only gets a couple minutes to react to who they take  instead of weeks
Because if they dont actually care theyd love to trade down. Or to make it so they can trade down and still get their guy.
Because worst case scenario… let’s say this year the Panthers are adamant they are drafting Bryce Young. They trade up to number 1 and tell the world we are drafting Bryce young. And then they stop looking at any other top picks because they are drafting Young. The day before the draft Young is in a freak accident that teleports him to Mars. Now what do the Panthers do? They’ve said all along they were drafting young they did no research on anyone else and investigated no possible trades…… Now is that completely far fetched and nearly impossible yup, but if they you’re a GM you’ve got to be ready. Look at that lineman from a few years ago with his smoking pot video leaked… I bet a lot of teams had been hoping to grab him in the first and suddenly had to remove him from the board because they couldn’t be sure what would happen. The Carter thing this year is similar but it happened early enough teams can dive in now versus later. Or imagine in 2005 when the top QB prospect started falling down the board and teams in the back half hadn’t done the homework on him assuming he wouldn’t be available. I didn’t follow the draft as much then as I was 14 but I imagine some GMs in the 15-23 range ended up kicking themselves pretty hard for having not taken a better look at Rodgers the way Green Bay had.
Because you want the teams behind you second guessing their decisions then you laugh at their predicament.
The last time we saw a draft like this everyone thought Darnold was going #1. The browns shocked the world by taking Mayfield instead. You can destroy multiple teams draft boards by throwing smoke screens.
Because the league likes drama & speculation keeping the draft in lively discourse for weeks and flat out tells the teams with the 1st overall to shut up…
They can still trade the pick again. So if they reveal who they are taking, that takes away a lot of leverage. Let’s say they state publicly they are taking Bryce. Now every team nows they can call Houston at two if they had another qb at the top of their board. They won’t even call Carolina at one.   In Carolina’s shoes, they keep the pick quiet so their phone still rings. Highly unlikely another teams trade to one, but you never know.
Because the other teams that go after you have to spend more time in a player you know you’re drafting. Puts them at a slight disadvantage. So the Texans have to look at 3 QBs instead of 2. Or probably 1 instead of 2. It can make a big difference
Panthers mentioned they could trade the pick.  If after interviews and whatnot they werent super impressed for any reason with young/stroud and someone offered more than they gave they can still move. Beyond unlikely but another team might become infatuated with someone and offer the house.
Watch draft day.
I guess in case another team who wants that player is willing to trade their entire future away for the pick.   In reality, they don’t need to smokescreen and don’t do it.
Well it depends on the year. Like the Panthers could be trying to get a rise out of the Texans this year to see if they can bait them into trading up for the 1st pick.   Texans have, understandably, been very quiet so other teams don't know who they want.   Unless I've missed something it's been very quiet and we've just assumed they want Bryce.
Maybe to see if it starts ripples.  Maybe they want one of the teams under them to trade up so they can get changed and picks💁. Not a while to to do it for
It made way more sense back before the drafts slots so that teams could start negotiating earlier
If they don’t plan on taking the top prospect, they could potentially convince the #2 or #3 team to give up the farm to trade spots with them. If so, they would get the guy they wanted and a little extra for the pick swap.
If they really want Richardson over the other 2 (which I think id unlikely) they could try and get the Colts to trade with them
It costs the team picking first nothing to not show their hand until it’s time.  This is the big kid’s table. If it costs you nothing to cause chaos to your competitors, then you do it. They aren’t in the business of helping their rivals. They are in the business of fucking with them as much as possible when it costs you nothing.
To try and bait someone into trading for the pick.  Say the Panthers really want Richardson. They know the Texans want CJ. They can possibly get the Texans into swapping and get Richardson at a lower pick, while gaining extra picks, or a player, or cash considerations.
Never let your enemies know your next move
Because it’s not a smokescreen. You’d think people would’ve learned after Walker went #1
What would happen if they just announced that they were taking, for example, CJ Stroud, today and then the next team announced their pick and so on? No need for a big event, just do it over Twitter. Let's get this done.
They don’t a lot of times. I imagine it’s just normal practice and habit to not tip your hand though
The Lions signed Stafford to a contract before they even drafted him. That would never happen now a days.
Why would you make anyone else's job easier?
For the memes
Always keep 'em guessing. Some team could get desperate for one particular player and offer a big trade; that's less likely to happen if everyone already knows who the first pick is going to be.
In case they wanted to trade out of it.
Counter argument: what do you net by telling everyone your plan?
To encourage gambling on Young being the top pick.
I think part of it is just natural. But also why give Houston the gift of knowing what their options are this far out?
They not sold on stroud or young they wasn't trying to get to 1 they was eying the third pick from cardinals didn't get them to budge so went a couple levels up. I think they like Anthony Richardson they looking to get draft capital if they can convince Houston that they are going to take the guy the Texans want. This smoke screen is for Houston to get nervous and make the call to move up.
If the Panthers let everyone know who they're going to pick, that gives a (slight) advantage to the other teams in the league, that they can take one guy off their draft board.  This is magnified by the fact that this year pretty much every team in the NFCS needs a QB and are presumably considering their options (including trading up to an earlier spot). Panthers have plenty of motivation to make those considerations as difficult as possible for their division rivals.
I'm confused. Is it coincidence that the Bucs would take Jameis (Winston) and Rams would take (Jared) Goff?  Am I reading a time traveling reddit post? What's going on here XD
It's a racket. The NFL generates tons of media clicks from mock drafts and articles about teams taking player B over player A. Those clicks bring in ad revenue for the NFL and their affiliates. It also causes discussions and debates that lead to increased views on draft night. Those views mean more ad revenue.   It all boils down to money. The NFL wants teams to keep their cards close to the chest because of money.
Because that's what daddy Roger told them to do
This way you can force people into pulling another Bears taking Trubisky move.
Panthers have said they’re willing to trade back.
So that way it can mess with their competition & make them possibly second guess themselves.
we do a little-a trolling
Because they don‘t want to make it easy on the next guys.  Maybe some of then have to pay more to draft up and „waste“ time scouting someone.
Because the NFL is a business, and not a sport, first and foremost. Any news is profitable.
Maybe the Panthers truly don’t care if they get Young or Stroud and the Texans prefer one over the other. If the Panthers muddy the water, the Texans might say fu*k it and trade up to 1. Panthers could add a nice draft pick and still get one of their guys.
A lot of dopey answers in here. It's to make the other teams work harder and waste time
Pretty sure the NFL told teams to stop doing this because it ruins draft coverage.  Even if it is only the first 10 minutes.
Makes all the other teams waste resources and time to research players they wouldn't otherwise have to
A: They're trying to get the Texans to trade up to 1 to recoup some value.  B: The NFL doesn't want picks leaking as the first few picks drive casual viewership to the draft and the draft is a massive money generator.
I think it's for the same reason the NFL clamped down on insiders leaking the picks prior before the televised reveal.  The NFL loves the speculation/drama/news cycle, the more uncertainty brings more eyes to the draft and keeps the NFL in the media even when there's no football being played.
They’re trying to market the sport
Some men just want to watch the world burn.
NFL probably tells them to do that to keep everyone edging
If you are hoping someone makes an even better offer than what you have.. you guess who might put together that package and find who they might offer it for and act  like THAT’s who you want. Granted you probably want the first pick if you traded to get it, but if someone wants to make you a crazy offer— then you take it.  This year the Panthers gave a lot but not as much as the Bears could have gotten. They could in theory sell that pick and make a value profit.
Attention
Different teams want to trade up for different reasons/prospects.   If a team knows 100% who you’re selecting, then you’re closing the door on a team offering up an incredibly stupid Ricky Williams/Hershel Walker type haul.
Because they want the Texans to trade up for Bryce young so they can recoup some assets they gave up to move to 1. Mystery solved
The way I see it is that it will pressure other teams into making bigger offers to trade for that spot. In a draft like this years where there are a bunch of talented qbs early and you know one team has their hearts set on one guy you could pretend you’re going to get him and see what they offer you to fall back a pick or two
I’m willing to believe that the NFL wants to keep suspense for the draft and wouldn’t want teams clearly saying who they are gonna pick. Gotta maximize views
I’m going to disagree with most people here, I think that the panthers still probably haven’t completely made their decision yet, and wanted to trade for the pick before anyone else did so that they could have the luxury of picking the guy they want instead of the Texans or whoever else wanted it
Wow. Pretty serious.
Unnecessary is telling people what you're gonna do...you've got it backwards
To keep your options open for a possible trade back. The 2017 NBA draft is a great example of this. The top 3 in draft order were the Celtics, Lakers, and Sixers. The top 3 prospects in that draft were Markelle Fultz, Lonzo Ball, and Jayson Tatum. Everyone and their mother knew the Lakers were going to take Lonzo at #2, and Lonzo didn't really fit the needs of the Celtics or Sixers at the time so it was a forgeone conclusion he was going to end up in the purple and gold. The Celtics were all in on Tatum the entire team and could have easily stayed at #1 and just picked him there. But the Celtics knew the Sixers were infatuated with Markelle Fultz, so the Celtics did not reveal their interest in Tatum in order to make it look like they were undecided between the two. This scared Philly, so they traded #3 overall + a future 1st to swap picks with the Celtics. If the Celtics did what you said they should, they would not have gotten that additional pick.
From a media perspective drama is good obviously. Putting that aside, let's say Carolina wants to select Stroud and gets some reliable intel that Houston is praying for Young. Baiting them into giving up something to go get Young could be a strategy. That's not what I think is happening at all personally, just answering your question.
If they come out saying they 100% want Shroud then teams aren't going to get invested.  If they say otherwise teams will get invested. If they don't want Shroud they can get multiple teams involved and drive the price up for a trade down.
Everyone knows they are gonna pick Aiden Hutchinson
The correct answer. We compete with all these teams. Don't help em in any way when you don't have to.
Welcome to pop copy
MCDC energy right there lol
There is so much uncertainty with all prospects. People forget that the practice of calling a player before turning in the pick started because GMs wanted to confirm the player was alive before making the selection.
> Young now knows he was "Plan B" and you're starting the relationship with your franchise QB on the wrong foot.  They call this move the “Jack Eichel”
Makes sense. But I wonder what they’re saying to both of them in pre draft meetings
if they think any of these QBs are mentally weak enough that they can't even handle a team considering another option before them and ultimately picking them. . . . . they shouldn't touch that guy with a 5th round draft pick. I think it's fair that they are simply undecided, but knew they would want one of them so wanted to go first overall to get whichever one they chose. They had to make that choice before FA because the Bears were not going to sit on their hands at WR and wanted DJ. Once FA opens up Panthers could lose that trade option to someone.
The only pick I can even remember who was actually announced pre-draft was Luck, and even then it was only a week or so early
Yeah, I think this is the real answer. I also think GMs like to pretend that they’re playing espionage games too. I remember an old article by Chuck Klosterman when he was with Grantland. He was embedded with the Browns (Lombardi-Banner era) all day on draft day and one of his main takeaways on the subject of all the paranoia and secrecy when it comes to the draft was this:  I’ve never witnessed this level of institutional paranoia within a universe so devoid of actual secrets. I don’t even know what they don’t want me to know.
And in the teams best interest. Free PR.
Nfl media is at its worst pre and post draft. Anything they can make a story, they will.
This is the real reason. I don’t think the NFL wants it to be clear who the team with the first pick will take, so they tell them to not disclose too much
I can't remember who but I remember a draft insider saying on a pod that the league sends a memo out to teams to not spoil the number 1 pick for the sake of publicity and such
Players and fans often forget the nfl is in the entertainment industry, drama for Microsoft = failing stock price, drama for the nfl = millions
Literally it was great for the nba that nobody knew Orlando wanted Banchero till literally draft time
I feel like most teams just follow their board though.
After they already traded to one it seems a bit convoluted... guess it could play out that they liked the top 2 equally and couldnt get Texas to budge, but then why would they budge now?
Does anyone who is intelligent have that thought? It makes no sense at all.
Agreed, just like the NFL got mad a team last year for not taking all their time to pick (I think it was the Lions with Hutch), I think the league makes teams keep it to themselves for the suspense
If we got the Saints to trade up to 3 hoping to grab Stroud I'd shit myself.
Lol that’s just wrong. Teams have always done this and will always do this across all the major leagues. It’s to try and out pressure onto other teams. Texans have been rumored to love Bryce young. Okay well they own #2. Now the panthers might secretly want CJ so they are gonna say hey we love Bryce to see if houston bites and trades for 1 and they both get who they truly wanted but now the panthers got a little something extra from Houston
This is really asinine logic.  The absolute best way for a GM to keep his job, and even make more money, is winning games, putting together a great team, and winning Superbowls.
Totally understand this - I do remember years ago the 1st overall pick used to be announced before the draft though. Sometimes even the second pick.
No they weren’t lol
Yep. I think most people thought Goff was the pick for the Rams but there definitely was not any sort of confirmation until the the draft.
That only makes sense if the team didn’t trade for the first overall   Playing fuck fuck games just suggests that they are regretting their decision and just like a wallstreetbets Redditor who realized his crypto is worthless, wants to offload it on to a bigger fool
I fell asleep on it**.**  Kevin Costner can suck this dick
The Texans don’t have a play so long as the Panthers refuse to commit to who they want. Regardless of who actually gets picked, the Texans are taking sloppy seconds unless they trade out of 2nd
Check stroud and picks.. not changed
100%, being vague could make an opponent spend extra draft capital to move up behind them hoping the qb they want is there as they don’t know who panthers are actually taking
Can I please have more info on this incredible piece of NFL lore
Didn’t the Lions basically agree on a contract with Stafford before drafting him?
TIL Kyle Shanahan is primed for a GM job
"mentally weak enough". Bro it's a business. If your business straight up told you that you were their backup and they would have preferred someone else, do you think you would be re-upping your contract with them or would you be more likely to look at other offers from other companies? Pretty obvious there man.
Pre-CBA I think it was more common as teams needed to negotiate a contract with the player.
Stafford was announced before the draft
Mario Williams had a contract before the '06 draft started.
Players used to have *contracts* before the draft lol. And not even that long ago.
I recall the Jags being quite open about taking Lawerence. I don't recall hearing as much rumors about anyone else that wasn't trolling.
And that was basically a given from like, week 3 of the previous year  "Suck for Luck"
Mario Williams was announced before the draft
Like officially announced? Because off the top of my head I think like the last 5 drafts have all been reported the day of or the day before that the teams were locked in on their pick.
I think a few of the #1 QBs before the rookie wage scale were announced ahead of time so contract negotiations could start.
I feel like Clowney was announced pre draft as well but could be mistaken.
I remember Mario Williams being leaked going #1 and us saints fans celebrating Reggie bush
Yeah but the possibility of trading up or back makes things more complicated
The increased cost is in the resources spent developing their board. You force them to consider scenarios that aren’t actually going to happen instead of spending that manpower evaluating other prospects and situations. As tiny and petty as it is, why give any of your opponents any advantage, no matter how small?
2nd probably doesn't get screwed. 4th or 5th probably might if they thought a higher pick wasn't going to take a position and they did.
If the panthers view the top two equally and the texans don’t, then the texans could definitely budge now or on draft day.
It's a TV product now, so rushing your pick gives the talking heads less time to discuss the prior one
Except that prior to the NFL embracing gambling, it was not uncommon for teams holding the #1 overall pick to announce their intent well before the draft even started.  Now teams are no longer doing that and it just happens to have coincided with the stance change on gambling.   A bit too coincidental.
Exactly if the Owner sees you doing due diligence on Peyton Manning and Ryan Leaf and you draft Ryan Leaf that owners is still going to fire you when you are dumpster fire.
You can’t just choose to win a Super Bowl though. You can choose to look busy
You’re missing the point. He’s saying that even if the GM is locked in on his guy, it’s in his best interest to keep quiet and act like they’re still thinking about it.
That was when you had to negotiate with them and hold outs were common. There was an advantage to starting that process early
They absolutely were.  I was scared shitless they'd take Mariota at the time.
Never underestimate the power of greed.  Teams do it every year.  "But I *could* get more.."
It was mentioned that the panthers wanted to trade to 3rd or 5th, but weren't getting any interest.
I mean theoretically they could trade with the Texans or Cardinals if they really, really didn’t have that big of a differences between the top guys or if they knew their guy would fall. It’s never really happened in the NFL but it’s not unprecedented in other sports.
Lmao this may be one of my all time favorite reddit comments. I’m 100% using “fuck fuck games” from here on out
> That only makes sense if the team didn’t trade for the first overall   OP didnt ask why the current team to hold 1st overall would need to smoke screen. But it doesnt actually change the answer, they felt the leverage they gain from getting #1 was worth more than they gave up.
>Playing fuck fuck games   adding this to my lexicon immediately
Eh, Colts or another top team could still trade up to 1 if they are locked in on someone. Shouldn’t matter who’s got it or how they got it.
That makes no sense.   In what way would they regret their decision? If there was ever any doubt of who they wanted, they never would have traded in the first place.   If anything, they were on the fence about stroud/young and having the first ensures they can get who they want.
They are trying to get the Texans to give them something to move up
yeah they wont pick second if they trade to 1st that was what the oc saod.
Not to mention the time wasted investigating the guy you know you're going to take.
But at the same time another team is getting that draft capital. You can't create value
Wouldn’t they wait to finalize those trades until the pick is in though? If their guy is gone they’d just back out.
Ok, but do you think that the draft capital just disappears?  Somebody gets it, and it could be your biggest nemesis.
But what if a rival ends up getting a great trade and extra draft picks because someone tried to move up.   Moreover, if you declare who you want then teams can offer you something for that pick instead of hoping you don't make that pick.
Never happened in the NFL but happened two times in consecutive years in the CFL.  https://apnews.com/article/c4d173ab5dff71ce04383d287c3b763c
There is none, they made this up.
I too need to know. Dish!
Yes, this was common before the rookie salary caps and usually the contract was announced the day before or morning of the draft.
That was more common before the rookie contract scale.  You wanted to make sure the guy you drafted was actually going to play for you and not hold out over a contract dispute.  Between Jamarcus Russell holding out and the start of the rookie contract scale, every 1st overall pick had already agreed to a contract before they were drafted.
My business is very different from the way the NFL evaluates talent. If I was a QB coming up through the NFL draft, I wouldn't. That's the way it goes. If you can't handle people evalutating your talent level and comparing it to your peers than I hope you manage your entire football career without access to internet or cable TV. The only time it should be considered disrespect is when you're being compared to someone obviously inferior. If the Chiefs decided they were gonna bring in Cam Newton and it would be a "competition" in the off-season, he should be offended. If the Falcons did that, well their QB (cannot remember his name atm) hasn't earned or proven anything so that shouldn't offend him.
I swear there was a year where the top 3 picks in the draft all agreed to their deals before the draft happened.
Leaked picks? Sure. But as far as holding a press conference to officially announce the pick a week+ in advance of the draft I still can't think of or find any players besides Luck.
Stafford was the last one before they changed the pay scale.
If a player might go all Manning that would certain reassure a team.
That was pretty straight forward and well known he was the player they were taking as soon as they got the 1 spot… like any other move and the Jags owner GM would’ve needed to check into an asylum
Officially announced with a team press conference, yeah
Baker was absolutely not locked in at #1. Maybe the day of it was rumored as locked in, but there was a lot of talk of others up to the draft.  Same shit with Myles too. Even though he was absolutely, 100%, locked in. Dude went to dinner with the whole FO and Jim Brown and was wearing a Browns shirt under his shirt at his draft party at his house.
I think he means announced formally, not Schefter with a ‘The Browns are lasering in Baker with the #1’
I mean if they really don't mind either guy they can probably snake a third or so from the Texans for the pick if they have a preference.
Can you name a team that publicly announced its intentions before the draft?
was this before or after the rookie wage scale change? as mentioned in a thread above the extravagant salaries top picks got made contract negotiation a bigger thing back in the Stafford days then it is today.
I don’t know if it’s just gambling. I recall around the time that previous teams announced who they would select, there were reports that the NFL were unhappy about this and wanted teams to stop doing that to increase draft buzz and TV ratings.   There was a lot of talk that the NFL would ask teams holding the number one pick to keep quiet - maybe that’s since happened behind the scenes.
No one ever accused Trader Scott of not being busy
The choices the GM makes are literally one of the most important parts to winning a Superbowl?
Damn. I know we haven't won many games, but look how busy my GM looks. He's great at his job.
He didn't make that point.  How, and be specific, does this help a GM keep their job?
Ah, thanks for that. That's right, that was before the rookie contracts being slotted by draft position and top picks were getting paid like they were at the top of their position in the league.
That’s great, but there were widespread reports of Winston being the guy and the Vegas odds on Winston were 2-15.   That was about as sure of a pick as their has been without the team outright announcing it.   Same as the next year Goff was -850.   We can pretend it was some sort of coin flip or it’s as not 100% certain but i would have been a total shock for the opposite to happen in some of these drafts.
The fact that the bears rather roll with fields shows how the league actually views Young and Stroud
Fair warning it’s gonna make you sound extremely /r/justbootthings
That only works if you subscribe to the greater fool theory
They have the first so there is no reason to be on the fence unless they are hoping for an even bigger fool to come along and trade them for a bigger haul than they one they paid to move up
The Texans have a terrible roster full of holes whose best players are all O’Brien era guys, the only upside for Houston is all the draft picks they have. They aren’t trading a haul to move up to pick Chicagos rejects
Depends, if a NFCS team moves up and spends capital, that’s a team that within the panthers division that might be weaker in the long term.  At the very least, you contributed to them having less assets to make the team better.
You can direct value to another conference
You can create value in your division ie the falcons and maybe the buccs as well.
In theory you *could*. If you really are sufficiently vague and the team at #2 also needs a QB you could maybe milk something out of them with a disclosure about who they're picking if it's not the guy you want. The exact circumstances for this to occur would probably be rare, but not too dissimilar from the Bears trade for Trubisky
This is true, but it’s still all predicated on nebulous assumptions that can’t be confirmed or denied, which I think is the reason teams with the top pick rarely tip their hand. There’s no reason to give an information advantage to your opponents, no matter how small.
In this case 2nd pick is Houston though, different conference. A division rival doesn’t pick until 8th
Sounds like a mistake Kyle Shanahan would never make.
Same team that signed Manziel.
It's so funny that you made this comment 5 hours after the comment linking to the AP story about it.
What If your wife said she preferred your brother, but settled for you?
Bradford year pretty sure. 2010
The 1st pick use to be able to negotiate before the draft but only that one
There are definitely others who meet your original standard of being "actually announced pre-draft" (not sure where the new idea of a press conference a week in advance comes from). Mario Williams and Matt Stafford both signed contracts with the Texans and Lions before their drafts even started.
That’s incorrect- Sam Bradford was the last before the pay scale was changed.
Yeah he already replied that clarification.
https://www.nfl.com/news/andrew-luck-will-be-indianapolis-colts-first-pick-in-nfl-draft-09000d5d8288de6e  Not all teams would have their GM's come out and say it outright like the Colts did, but they would absolutely clearly state their intentions to insiders like Schefter.
Contracts are functionally irrelevant when it comes to making the pick, even pre-wage scale.  No team was not going to draft a QB #1 overall just because they wanted a big contract.
This is a big part of it as well. I remember reading that Burrow had regular meetings with the OC for Cincy prior to the draft because they had already told him he would be the pick. The NFL wants as many people watching the draft as possible and if picks start leaking early then you’ll potentially have less people watching.   Plus the whole rookie wage scale plays into it as well. They’d announce picks earlier to start working on a contract.
Yes, the NFL asked teams to stop doing it.  Sure, ratings is certainly part of the decision. But there's far more money in the gambling aspect of the first overall pick.
He actually did make that point. Take a lap, nephew
Strictly speaking, it shows how the Bears view Young and Stroud, but also Fields.
I don’t think it’s that they’d rather roll with Fields, it’s that the Bears in particular have a ton of holes on their roster and taking a new QB isn’t going to fix that.   Instead they traded down, got an extra first next year, a couple more second round picks, and a true WR1. Now they’ll have one more year to see if Fields is the guy, and if he isn’t, use the extra draft capital to trade up next year for a guy if you need to.  As we’ve seen a ton lately too, it can take awhile for a QB to really figure it out, so it’d be kind of dumb to give up on Fields so quickly.
I didn’t know that was a thing lol. Still think it’s funny but I get it
Not really sure how that relates. I'm not saying they got the pick as an investment. But it's possible that maybe the Texans and the Colts both fall in love with a QB. If Carolina finds something out that maybe lowers their view of their guy, or has substantial reason to believe he'll still be there, a la Celtics and Tatum, they could do that and recoup some value.
The Panthers announced that the 1st overall would be a group decision between multiple people, not just a gm picking.   Nearly everyone involved in that pick would have been new to the organization, meaning it wouldn't be a " sit down for lunch and figure it out " situation.   It is far more logical to assume they narrowed it down to Stroud/Young and wanted the 1st overall ( Chicago was openly shopping it ) to ensure they got whoever they ended up wanting.  It doesn't really make sense for a team to make that type of trade given all the data they already had on the qbs and then suddenly decide " whoops, these qbs aren't worth it . "
I never said anything about a haul, but if the Panthers can even get a 3rd out of them to move down one spot and still take Stroud that would be a win and that’s what Carolina is going for right now
True but not by doing this since they aren't actually the ones making the trade. They can hope that's how it works out but there's no directing from the Panthers here
No way we draft a qb in the first round this year. Probably not at all
I don't see that comment. I'd be curious to see it because it sounds like that either happened in the 1960's when some NFL teams drafted players they didn't know actually existed, or was a joke taken out of context.
The only time it should be considered disrespect is when you’re being compared to someone obviously inferior.
Bradford didn't sign his rookie deal until July I believe
If I remember correctly, the other picks could start negotiating after all of the picks in front of them signed their contracts or something like that
Lions still got boned by Suh's contract as well. Rookie payscale Lions with Suh, Stafford, and Megatron could have been an absolute force. Proof that the system needed to change if a team can actually hit a home run with all those top picks and still not be a true contender
Yes you are right, ik it was one of them cause grumbling got real loud when Ryan signed.
A whole… minute before I did? When I loaded this page and read the comments, no one had replied already.   You’re welcome.
Oh, really?  Is that why you can't point out where or repeat it?  Lol.  The absolute number one way a GM can secure his job is by being good at his job.  That's always in his best interests.  Not "looking busy".  Or being "sneaky just for looks".  Most GMs operate a war room style draft room, as well.  So how are they just looking busy when they're all in the same room for hours together?  There's videos online, you know?  It's not some big secret.  The idea that GMs are sniveling little cubicle dwellers who pull a George costanza every time the boss walks by, and spend every waking moment pissing on their millions of guaranteed dollars at the thought of losing their job is asinine.  There's no point there.
I think Poles realized he was in a situation where he can't lose. He's building the offense up and if Fields underperforms next year then he can replace him with a rookie QB and he has an additional first-round pick to help him trade up if he needs to.
With your logic, the cardinals should have stuck with Josh Rosen rather than pick Murray?   You don’t pass on QB’s if you have the first overall unless you have zero faith in the prospects in front of you
Just one of those tells that anyone who spent time in the Army (and maybe the other branches? Not sure) would recognize instantly but never heard anywhere else lmao  The odds that /u/ABarbossa is a veteran are pretty high in my opinion
It relates because the panthers would need to find a bigger fool than them if they are to sell the first overall pick for a second time and recoup their losses that they spent to get the first overall from Chicago  You are out here proposing some Kevin Costner GM logic that only a very stupid team would fall for
If your theory held any water, they wouldn’t be wasting their time on low IQ meatheads like Levis or multi year projects like Richardson when their roster construction demands someone who can start playing yesterday
The panthers traded a haul to move up to number one, so unless they get a bigger haul back they just played fuck fuck games with themselves and need to stop taking that Draft Day movie seriously
I think the Bucs might take someone like Stetson Bennett in the 5th or 6th if he's there, but I don't think the team takes a QB with the expectation that theyll be a long-term starter in the league
They going to grab one in round two either Hooker or McKee.
It was the CFL not the NFL, but it happened in 94 and 96. [https://apnews.com/article/c4d173ab5dff71ce04383d287c3b763c](https://apnews.com/article/c4d173ab5dff71ce04383d287c3b763c)
Exactly! My brother is so much better.
If the rookie wage scale existed back then, the Lions could have been the Chiefs of that decade with all the extra cap space to shore up their roster weaknesses.
Log off for a bit.
the point is look busy. even if you knew who you were gonna draft the day the season ended.
That was a special situation and you know it. Kingsbury had wanted Murray as his QB for years at that point.   Fields has also looked way better than Rosen ever did. His ceiling is decently higher than Rosen’s was coming out of college too.   Obviously if you have an awful QB, it’d be dumb to make that move, but Fields has shown flashes and he improved as the year went on. The Bears GM has even come out and said they considered taking a QB, but with all of the holes they have it didn’t make sense.
They are trying to get the guy they traded up to 1 for and also draft some capital back in return
Is this Stetson Bennett guy the second coming of Brady??
Hooker isn’t going to be around in round 2
Okay I did see that, so yeah did not happen in the NFL, which is what we are talking about in /r/nfl  Would be like having a political discussion with another american citizen and citing child solders as a problem, then pointing out child soldier occurrences happening over the entire world.
It isn’t special at all, Rosen sucked and the Cardinals needed to pick someone else regardless of who their head coach was.
So…..a haul
Nah but he’s the same age as Brady though
The Tom Brady of car salesmen
Okay, whatever you say, that doesn’t apply to Fields though so it was a bad example.
yes it was special the cards had a brand new head coach with a hard on for Kyler and a rookie who underperformed. If they kept Wilkes(?) they could have gone a completly different direction.
When I think of a haul I think of multiple picks, I can’t imagine they would get much to move back one spot
He can’t read a defense and whose throwing motion is longer than Davis Mills neck. A year of Fields is like if they Titans decided to play Malik Wills all 17 games
With Goff throwing him the ball that would make a nice 0-16 connection.
"I chose zero because that's the number of times I've fumbled in my career. That's something I'm proud of. When I have the ball, it's MY ball. It is not YOUR ball. You get your chance to have the ball but this is my time to have the ball and you need to respect that."  Marvin Jones Jr. probably idk
Marvin J0nes!!!
Marvin Jones Jr. always has some top 100 catches every season. That’s a good pickup for Detroit.
He's anything but a 0. I remember him catching 4 TDs in one game for Cinci.
When the fuck did he go back to Detroit??
 Being the first 0 is cool, the first good 0 at QB is lucky
All I know is, I’m buying this jersey. MIJ is back and the first to rock the 0, I’m in
How exciting and newsworthy. /s
Shit now I'm gonna have to change the font on my Marvin Jonestown massacre shirts.
Me neither
So when is Russell Westbrook gonna suit up for the Rams?  /s
1-1=0
Why not the Aidan Hutchinson guy
I am excited they brought back zero in the NFL. I wonder which QB will wear it
Hey what the fuck
But if Goff is throwing to Marvin, wouldn't it be 16-0?   Lions not playing a full schedule next year confirmed.
Well fuck you too!
Yo that comment is ass 🔥🔥🔥
The connection is 16-0 though.
Fuck you, take my upvote
16-0-1
Ayo...
Hey bud, there are 17 games in a season
Well done, but it's quite literally a 16 to 0 connection...
Melvin Gordon changes his number to 99 after reading that
The Vikings slayer is back 😱
He did it for the Lions against the Vikings too.
Marvin Jones is the only active player with multiple 4 TD games
I mean Gilbert Arenas wore 0
I’m pretty sure we beat the Jets handedly in the game Marvin went for 4TDs.  Just checked to confirm, was 49-9
I think the official signing was today
0 on a QB just looks so weird to me when I imagine it.
Bahahaha!
Rest of the league forfeits after a 77-0 victory over the Chiefs in week 17
16-0-1. Lions usually good for a tie
Perfect season incoming. Week 17 forefits for the 17th win and Lions win SB after bulldozing every team. *drowns in the kool aid*
I love this comment format 😭😭😭
Lateral to Okudah on the 1 yard line
"I pride myself as a charitable man. I love to give, and I hate taking. It's selfish and not the kind of man I want to be. You know, the offense gets to touch the ball almost every play of the game; oftentimes, multiple guys get to do it. Then I look over at the defense, and I think, man, it's gotta be frustrating not to be able to touch the ball. So I put myself in their shoes and know I'd love to be able to touch the ball. So that's how I'm giving back. That's how I want to change the game."  - Melvin Gordon III probably idk
I got 99 problems and fumbing is all of them
“I just wish we had more digits.”
Those goal line fumbles with yall gave me PTSD flashbacks
Respect Superbowl Champion Melvin Gordon 🙏
Melvin “Sharing is Caring” Gordon
And they lost that game too.   Moral of the story: Don't Let Marvin Jones Catch 4 TDs for Your Team
as there's a drive into deep left field by Castellanos
It’s absolutely crazy because Gordon had a huge fumbling problem his rookie year and then went like 2 seasons without losing a fumble.   Goal line run in the last minutes against the Titans and he fumbled to lose the game and ever since then he hasn’t been able to hold onto the ball
Or just don't have a terrible defense. But yeah
No, that cant be it
Shang Tsung stole souls.  Shao Kahn was just the leader of Outworld.
Teams have won games with a terrible defense.  Teams have never won a game with Marvin Jones catching 4 TDs.  Draw your own conclusions.
Lol oh yeah. Been a minute
Fine. He’ll catch five!
https://www.nfl.com/games/jets-at-bengals-2013-reg-8  We won
Somewhere John Lynch just confiscated Kyle's phone.
Ekeler must be a masochist, cause he’s about to get punched in the face 31 more times
How is this new to what was reported a few weeks ago
Austin, you seem pretty upset at the Chargers.  How would you like to make $3M and play against them twice, next year?
Sean Payton should go get him. Ekeler is the perfect RB for his scheme
Funny how this morning the Chargers "refused" to discuss a new deal
Feel bad for Ekeler, but he’s probably not getting what he wants at this point. I would ask to play out the remaining deal so long as the chargers agree not to tag him next year. Then hope he stays healthy and has another great year. He got a decent chunk of change the first year when he was injured.
Ok he’s a great back. And I wish the nfl could do something for it’s running backs money wise so they could cash out during the 5 years their bodies last but when was the last time a running back threw a fit to get money and the team went on to not regret it. It sucks but the chargers are definitely in the right to not pay because paying running backs is almost always a terrible terrible investment.
Ekler deserves more money imo, but you don’t get paid for past production and the market for FAs just this offseason has been horrible for RBs. He’d be the best of the bunch (minus maybe Saquon who never really made it), but teams are not paying RBs, especially as they get tighter for cap.
Bears got their guy!
Wasn’t he allowed to seek a trade like a month ago
I then discussed, then she discussed, today there was a lot of discussions. Now, reports on Tua concussions. Rapoport Rap.
No one is trading for RB who wants a new deal.
wasn't this reported weeks ago? we have to stop letting journalists get away with rehashing stories
Future Bear Austin Ekeler  Future Charger Khalil Herbert
Do it, Dolphins.
Ill give you one Joe Mixon
He’s about to become the new Lev Bell.
Dude is a jabroni
Commenting just to come back and laugh at this entire comment section when Ekeler gets paid.
Come to Butt-Head
YES LAC pls trade up for Bijan
Hell yeah Austin, you deserve better. Most underrated guy in the NFL. Even if you don't get a paycheck this year, get outta that shithole city and organization.
He’s going to KC or the Bills isn’t he
I can see him getting a raise on his current deal but I can’t see anyone guaranteeing him more than the remaining years. If he’s pushing this hard for a long term deal then he probably knows something about his body everyone else doesn’t yet.
First time I am hearing about it.
Austin just text me he said he’s eating dinner at Kurk cousins house going over the playbook. I guess Dalvin said he never liked Kirk and he’s a dogshit qb so he’s leaving.
Josh’s elbow apparently struggled with short yardage
Come to butthead
Incoming 3 year 18 million contract from the niners lol
Now we're discussing. Discuss.
Worst comes to worst, Ekeler can sail away from Southern Cal using that man's ears.
Melvin Gordon drinking his coffee laughing… drops coffee.
Rapoport definitely doesn't have to worry about that guy hearing him.
That wouldn't stop him. Shanahan is currently driving to Ekeler with a contract.
First thing I thought when reading this was “some one lock up Kyle Shanahan”
“If we don’t trade for Ekeler, I promise we’ll let you draft a running back in the 3rd round. Deal?”
Ha that won't stop Kyle from using his burner phone to circumvent the rules
Unless Bengals or Bills decide to get spicy.
No! God no! Please god no! Nooooo!
Drue is whatever but Ekeler doing this would make me legit sad.
I want to start off by saying how much I hate this idea. But holy shit…ekeler on that offense would be pretty damn electric (and my nightmare)
I've got $4M here. Do I hear 5?
He is 100% gonna act offended by us offering like 7 mil a year and then go play for a rival for 5 mil a year once he realizes his market isn't what he wants
I would like to call dibs for the eagles
Hey, your friend Drew is here too!
He could lead the league in touchdowns in that scheme easily.
Please no, I’d really like it if we didn’t keep sending players to our divisional rivals thank you very much.
Ekeler got more targets last year in LA than AK has ever gotten by a substantial margin. It was also Ekelers career high by about the same margin, still I think the current Chargers system is the best place for him.
Use that 3rd on Ekeler? Seems like a deal to me tbh
Ekeler and Javonte would be the best 1-2 punch since I can remember, assuming Javonte comes back solid from surgery
didn't you get the memo.  Chargers bad, no matter what
Probably still doesn’t get the money he wants, but he’ll probably go anywhere else at this point.
Unless we see another AP or Henry, it’s not happening. They’re all too similar. No reason to overpay for a guy who’s just a little better.
RB was already a rough spot to get paid, but coming into this off-season, anyone who follows college knew that nobody was getting a bag.  This draft class is loaded with RB's and they'll ALL be cheaper and younger than any vet.
Yeah TE’s are all the rage now
They're unwilling to pay their best RB and arguably best WR.
It'll be a really weird offense where the QB mostly runs and the RB mostly catches passes
Right?
Gimme that Herbert-squared backfield
Will lead to a lot less confusion whenever I see a Herbert in a headline and everyone in the comments are talking about the Bears
I'd make the trade straight up, maybe bears also kick over a 5th or something.
In a heartbeat. Not a chance they take that though.
Jabroni sounds like a delicious pasta dish! 😋 yum
I forgot what sub I was on and just thought "Why would the Clippers want him?"
Either that or he’s pushing for a long term deal just like everyone else because he’s not a fucking idiot?  Also he only has one year left. He very likely can get more than just this year guaranteed from another team.
Dalvin would not be wrong
“Confiscated keys? No problem. I’ve recently taken up ultra-marathoning.”
Shananahan will find a way
No way we trade assets for a RB so we can sign him to a huge deal after orchestrating Mixon's deal to be caput when we re-sign Burrow/Chase and sold the damn naming rights to the stadium after never doing so, **EVER,** which was very publicly done to be able to afford Burrow/Chase.  I see the logic of what you're saying, but it's disregarding that we have a poor owner who can't afford to throw money at the salary cap until it gets bigger.
Not us, i think. We traded assets for essentially a lesser version of him in Hines and also restructured his deal to keep him this year, while also having a glaring need at actual receiver. We also signed Harris  Cook also started to look amazing as the year went on, and will most likely be eating the vast majority of snaps with Hines as a 3rd down option in clear passing sets and handling kick returns.
Bills already signed Harris.
I think the Bengals are much more likely to get a day 2 RB in the draft. We want to be able to keep Tee, Burrow, and Chase together and won't be able to afford the kind of contract Ekeler wants.
You think the chargers would ever send him to those teams?
Bengals already have enough pass catchers to pay.
Pls no.   Edit- playing him 4x a year sucks but he would be horrifying on one of those teams. Mainly the Bills although either way. Please no.
Think the dolphins make the most sense here, would fit their scheme real well
Yeah we can't afford him
Bills have low to no interest. We’re not in a position to be paying anymore RBs. We already signed Harris and restructured Hines contract. Between them and James Cook, that room is set.
Isn’t that exactly what was reported a few weeks ago?  https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/35858644/agent-chargers-grant-austin-ekeler-permission-seek-trade?platform=amp
They did before too, I think this is just more in depth look at the situation
You NorthEasterners sure do pronounce, "yes," oddly.
Imagine the fantasy potential
Goodbye Austin, it’s been nice, hope you find your, paradiseeeee
I very much doubt he will.  We can't really afford him.
Well now, it's sounding like a better and better idea the more Broncos fans talk about it. :P
We can do $3M, up to $5M with incentives.  It's on, Denver!
Waitasecond...I've seen that story before!!
Wait a minute. Does that mean that spiller/Kelley will be even better than ekeler aswell?
I'm not sure the players' association will go for it, but it's worth a shot!
Who wouldn't want to tackle Austin Ekeler in practice again?
As long as they keep on being irrelevant then pay them big bucks!
Yup.  And that system, and our fired O Coordinator are now in Denver
I think he will be cheaper than that he's 28 in a month and wants a raise.
I'm glad we get shit on without having any tangible success. Super fun lol
Offering what you think someone is worth is refusing to negotiate, didn't you hear? You are OBLIGATED to pay more than that.
Can DJ Moore throw?
Well, "Breaking news: Guy who could seek a trade a month ago still allowed to seek trade." didn't have the same ring to it.
I would do it for sure. Ekeler is a much better pass blocker and receiver than Herbert. And if he will sign for 3 years that’s doable. We have plenty of money.
He doesn't need his legs to coach.- John Lynch (probably)
The Shanana
Aren’t the teams each allotted money for the cap to spend? I would figure naming rights for the stadium has nothing to do with that, that’s just more money for the ownership to pocket.
>sold the damn naming rights to the stadium after never doing so, EVER, which was very publicly done to be able to afford Burrow/Chase.  I know the poverty franchise label gets thrown around a ton but goddamn
The NFL has a credit line that owners can borrow up to 600 million for their teams with low interest rates from their own lending arm. This is on top of the revenue sharing that each team gets. IIRC it was about 350 million per team.  If team owners really want to sign a player, they can do it unless they have a really screwed up financial situation.
Hines + 4th for Ekeler? Then you got Ekeler-Harris-Cook  Ekeler would help that receiving issue greatly.
Trade hines and a mid round pick for Ekeler. If the money can be manipulated...
If the alternative is that he sits out then walks, why wouldn't they?
Lol, like the “post Brady” patriots would be impacted by a contender improving.
TEN MILLION DOLLARS
Yea you’re probably right. Just kinda messing around with the Payton wanting a RB in round 3 to all the Javonte Williams dynasty owners
I’m not sure how I would feel to have all three of these players on the same team:  Khalil Mack  Justin Herbert  Khalil Herbert
Yeah i’m cool on paying an running back. You can get one in the 4th or 5th for way less money with way less mileage.
As interested as I’d be, I don’t think Poles would make that move
Kyle Shanahan is driving around LA, frantically begging for Ekeler’s address through texts.
What I've seen a few times in reddit is that they sold the naming rights to have the cash for the escrow for all those contacts.
I have never felt ashamed of being a Bengals fan until today, when a Bronco's fan showed pity on me.
The Bengals are known for not kicking the can down the road and playing the salary cap shell game (which is absolutely a valid strategy). They tend to front load or evenly spread out contracts so there's no balloon payments at the end of player deals.
I don't hate this. I like Hines.
We're not quite up against the cap yet (still lots of room to free up money), but I'd rather not with Ekeler. This is a stacked RB class, I'd rather just throw another dart in the 4th or 5th round.
Hines is a solid reciever, and a good returner
I’d assume based on his comments, Ekeler is expecting to get paid at least wr3 money which per him is 9M a year which was above the market for any free agent that got a multi year deal.  I’d assume Bills and Bengals might be cap scrapped if Ekeler wants a 3Y 30m deal.
He’s not going to sit out. He wouldn’t get paid.
Ekeler said in an interview that he'd play next year with LAC as worst case scenario and 'bet on himself'. i don't think sitting out = betting on himself
Doesn’t sitting out just not count as a year towards the contract?
I may act tough, but I got a lot of feelings, and you hurt, damn near every one of them.
How ironic coming from a Bucs fan lol
Gaddamn, Campbell.  Calm down, you can't spend on everyone!
Now we just need Justin Mack.
That's just people making shit up, it might be right or it might be wrong. We don't even *know* that the NFL still asks for guaranteed money in escrow, we only know that the owners use it as an excuse for why they don't give out guaranteed deals.
We’ve since discovered that escrow payments aren’t mandatory. They “may be” required which in legalese means they aren’t required.
Or signing bonuses
I get it, the Broncos suck but it's nice knowing that money isn't an issue for ownership
Yep seconded.  Hines keeps the backfield outlet open, and lets us find a more "traditional" bruising RB.  Plus we can solve our return game woes with Hines too.
We're not trading ekeler for a 4th and Hines lmao never gonna happen.
We didn’t use him in that capacity at all this year. Maybe because he came in late, but it was pretty basic stuff for him.
Probably right, but we heard the same thing said about Bell
Dinner’s gonna be cold tonight, asshole!
I'm sure that flair will change this season.
Yes he can! Watch!
Don't tell me how to live my life! You're not my real dad!
[MORE!!! MORE!!! MORE!!!](https://youtu.be/0wFHqFpZjJ8)
Sure. I'm just explaining OP's comment since the other poster thought it was related to the cap.
Cool. I'm just explaining OP's comment since the other poster thought it was related to the cap.
We've discovered reasons to suspect the escrow payments aren't mandatory, but it's far from clear either direction at this point.
Whatever, Empower Field at Mile High
NFL teams just don't spit off a ton of cash flow, especially compared to their open market value.
I remember reading a bills fan say in this sub that McDermott is weird about how he plays skill position players in their first year, he keeps it very vanilla for them. I don’t know if that’s true or not but I thought it was interesting.
Bell didn’t want to play on the franchise tag; Eckler is still under contract.
HE'S NOT EVEN THE GM, DAMMIT!!
*STAR WARS MOMENT*
Yeah I’m just providing context as to what that escrow actually means and how it’s a giant nothing-burger.
You mean when the naming rights were sold under the previous trust? The Waltons aren't going to need to hold a garage sale just to pay players.
That’s very true for almost all Bills rookies lately. CB’s and WR’s especially.  It can be frustrating when we see other teams have rookie success and be able to use that like the Chiefs and Eagles this year.
Eckler
You think silly barriers like "job responsibilities" are gonna stop the slab of BEEF that is MCDC??
No they just continue paying people minimum wage while employees collect welfare and allow our tax dollars to supplement their income. All while making billions and eroding small buisness. You should be proud. The broncos should be America's team since our tax dollars save them so much we basically bought it.
Chiefs are definitely similar with WRs, first year wideouts in Andy’s system just don’t seem to do much
That’s how he gets around the contract situation. Changing his name *points to noggin*
Hm.  That's a fair point.
Don't care 🤷‍♂️   Cry about unethical billionaires to someone else
Whichever of the top QBs we pass on.
BJ Ojulari. Good chance he goes 2nd round but he’s 1st round talent.
LaPorta.  He's the hill I've decided to die on.  I'm thinking he could be Kelce's heir.
Cedric Tillman, somehow the only receiver in the top 10 or so that’s above average height and wingspan. That’s literally all I’m basing this on, I’m mostly just upset that all the top receivers this year are short slot guys.
Dalton Kincaid could wind up being the best pass catcher in the draft
Jonathan Mingo
QJ, just cause everyone seems to think he’ll suck, like they grimace at the idea of him as a top WR prospect
Charlie Jones, WR, Purdue is going to be a 5th round pick and have a 10-12 year career as a starting slot receiver.  If Calijah Kancey's strength isn't an issue (didn't bench), he's going to be a top 5 player from this draft.   Zach Charbonnet is going to be a better RB than Bijan Robinson.  There are my hot takes.
Anthony Richardson   The more negative takes on this sub about a prospect (especially QB), the better they generally do.
All the picks my team makes
Charbonnet and Ringo.
Juice Scruggs. He’ll be a top 10 guard by the end of the season.
Mo Ibrahim
O'Cyrus Torrence will quickly become one of the league's best interior linemen.
Keeanu Benton out of Wisconsin. 308lb DT that can put pressure on a QB. Will probably go in the 3rd and will be solid as hell by whoever drafts him.
Jack Campbell
JSN
I think Will McDonald could have a better career than Will Anderson.
Lukas Van Ness, out of Iowa, should be excellent. He was paired against some stout O-Linemen in the BIG 10 this year (including Paris Johnson Jr.) and played phenomenal. The dude blocked 2 punts in one game.  https://youtu.be/UWAhd3NXo-s
Jartavius Martin. May be best S in the draft
Hooker if comes back from the injury well
Tank Dell
Kendre Miller is going to be the RB2 of this class
I think that jaxon smith njibgba could end up being that JJ of the draft where he could have been drafted alot earlier.
Dorian Thompson-Robinson
Kayshon Boutte will be the best WR in this class.
Stetson Bennett
Hooker. I think he'll end up being the best QB of the draft.
No one the Raiders pick <Raider Fan>
Mazi Smith
Mazi Smith. Dude has a ridiculous write up from Michigan.  If the Packers draft Darnell Washington, I could also see him exceeding expectations
Drew Sanders   He’s gonna be Micah Parsons 2.0. He’s a Swiss Army knife that can line up all over the front seven. Former #1 ranked athlete out of high school and only transferred out of Alabama because he got stuck behind Will Anderson and Dallas Turner (who will both likely be top 5 picks). Sanders is a relentless freak on the field   He’s a guy that will get drafted late first round and people will say “who?” and then absolutely ball out. Hope he makes it to the Pats 2nd round pick but I doubt it
Cody Mauch
Rashee Rice
Hooker, he'd be talked about going in the top of the first if it wasn't for injury concerns/age.  Some team could easily get a very, very solid backup for the next 10 years, and at best, a franchise QB for the next decade.  That said these NFL GMs know way more than me, and I imagine would prefer a 25 year old franchise QB over a 21 year old complete project.
Nice try Dave Ziegler
Darnell Wright will be the best lineman.
Whatever Day 2 WR the Steelers draft.  j/k but not really...  My pick is actually Brian Bresee.
Stetson Bennett if he falls to round 5
Justin Fields
Emmanuel Forbes. Same as Devonta Smith a few years ago. Just because someone is a size outlier doesn’t mean they can’t be successful
Keaton Mitchell
Jaren Hall
Will Anderson. He’s gonna average more sacks a game than The Waterboy
Trenton Simpson
Deonte Banks will be a top 5 corner in 2 years
Whoever Brad Holmes takes on day 3
If the Ravens take a WR in round 1: whatever WR is taken next. If they trade down and take one in early round 2: whatever WRs are taken between their original pick and wherever they traded to.
Anthony Richardson. I don’t know if it will be as a QB
I think that ekiyor, vorhees and Patterson will be a better class of lineman than skoronski, Johnson and jones
Marvin. When you dive into the advanced stats he’s way better than people realize. Also just seems like a cool dude.
Hendon Hooker, Vorhees, Charbonett, Sean Tucker,  G. Williams CB, Calijah Kancey, Sydney Brown,  Nathaniel Dell, Darnell Washington, Myles Murphy, Eli Ricks.  I'd guess most of these guys will outpace their draft position on their careers.
As is tradition. Any interior lineman we draft will be a probowl level player, any wr we draft will be released by year 4
Jackie Chen
RB Kenny McIntosh
Kendre miller will be the best running back in this class
Ji’ayir brown. He had the best coverage skills and ball instincts on the back end of a really good psu secondary. He’s a stud
AT Perry, Rashee Rice, Kyu Blu Kelly, Zack Kuntz and Jaren Hall
Hyatt
Riley Moss is destined to be the next Jason Sehorn
Johnston. Hoping the Texans take him with that extra 1st.
Stetson szn.
I like this take but hope they both do well  Stroud v Young SB 2024 who says no?!
Agreed, he's getting way underrated
I think the Eagles try to target him at 30 if we don’t get Carter or Nolan Smith at 10
I think he’s that guy no one is talking about that goes in the first round and then everyone says, “wait that makes sense”
Bengal
> Good chance he goes 2nd round but he’s 1st round talent  Runs in the family
I like LaPorta. I love Kraft. But Iowa is like Tight End U so I’m probably wrong.
I agree with you on this one, Laporta is getting slept on in this draft. I just hope to God he doesn't fucking get drafted by you guys
I 100% think the best pass catcher in this draft will be a TE.
I think he needs to go to the right place more so than JSN and Flowers who I would also put in this discussion, but I definitely agree
I think it’s just the back thing keeping him from having more hype. Back issues are a spooky thing and scare a lot of people off.
Any relationship to Barkevious, Hughtavious, and Hugh?
Huge Mingo fan here. He will wow a team
He's probably going to end up in Pittsburgh, so this is a great choice.
If you’re a huge X receiver that plays like you’re 5’8 on contested catches it’s easy to get written off.
Seeing Purdue next to Charlie jones hurts as an iowa fan. He’ll have an opportunity to return punts in the nfl too im sure
If that’s the case the answer is obviously Levis. This sub has a huge contingency of Richardson supporters
Week 1 I watched a gator game and was like who’s that dude? I want him on my team lol
Eh, the critics of last years' qb crop were accurate.  The majority of the fans and analysts trying to pusg them all into rd 1 and the top of it were clearly off base.
im on this train now
Thank you Mr Holmes
Ringo is the easy one for me from how far he has dropped compared to his ability.  Especially if he goes to a db whisperer and then it’s going to be a hard time for opposing teams.  Ringo next to Riq would be crazy
Not bad, but tbh, Rigotte would be a much better pairing.
With a name like that, how could he not?
I'm hoping the Saints draft this guy. A lot of teams have met with him already though, including the Saints.
You think his ceiling is that high?   I haven’t watched much on him but that’s kinda a big claim.
Him and rasheen ali
Yeah I have this weird feeling he's gonna almost immediately be a top 5 OG in the league for some reason
I think Jack Campbell isn't talked about because a lot of teams really want him and don't want to tip their hand.  But he'll go in the first round.
Please fall to 26 🙏🏼
Idk about that but McDonald is a good bet to be good.  Guy has among the best cornering ability around tackles and into the pocket that I can recall seeing.
Some have said this dude doesn't have a lick of pass rush moves to him. He's got a good stick and bull rush and nothing else.
This guy plays much bigger than his size.  I hope the Lions snag him mid round if he's there to play outside.  He has incredible ball skills and body control.  Its odd seeing him get no love during the draft lead up by outlets.  Is he a punk or something?  I dont follow college ball.  I dont get it.
Man I’m praying so hard that the packers take him
That you Kayshon?
I'm on the other extreme. I don't think he'll live up to his draft slot at all. He's shown literally no ability to rush the passer, despite being way more athletic than everyone he's lined up against. Travis Jones was better in every way coming out and he went 76th last year. That's the range that a nose tackle who can't rush should go
I think Mazi Smith ends up being a huge bust. .5 sacks in 30 college games for someone who is that athletic? Nah.
You’re assuming that Hooker is a solid backup or a franchise quarterback and not a project?      Hooker ran a super simplified offense while at Tennessee, and didn’t have much success until he was a lot older than his peers, so it’s not like he’s a sure fire franchise guy or even a sure fire backup quarterback from day one.
So hooker will be a franchise QB till the age of 35-36?  I’m not so sure about that lol
I dont understand how so many analysts rate Anthony Richardson as a better qb on tape than Hooker.  I dont watch college ball but from what I've found online and looking at stats Hooker is vastly superior as a passer, and the stats back up the eye test.  I dont get rating these never done it hyper athletes above players with translatable skills, proven records and resumes, with above average talent and skill sets.
Isn't he projected TE1
Bennett might go in round 7, but most likely UDFA and probably doesn't make a 53.
Forbes is 10 pounds lighter than Devonta smith.    There just isint a good comp for the guy lol, 166 pounds is smaller then quite a few highschoolers at the same position lol    Edit: Marcus Jones is the lightest corner in the nfl at 175 pounds, and he is 3 inches shorter then Forbes
Big fan of Keaton.
I bet Tune/Stetson/hooker have better careers than one of Young/Levis/Richardson
He’s gotten so much shit, he either needs to go on a Brady tear or suck and be out the league in 3 yrs
It would be pretty crazy for the top 2 picks to be traded to good teams but I guess not impossible
I do. I say no.
I think the Giants draft him at 25 if they don’t trade up to get a WR & reunite him with his brother.
I think he’s a “best player available” scenario if he ends up drafted in the first round. If not he’s easily one of the first people to be drafted in the 2nd round.  If the Giants don’t trade up to draft a WR or CB they should absolutely draft him at 25, reunite him with his brother.   An elite CB would be nice but if our pass rush is the Ojulari Brothers, Kayvon Thibodeaux, Dexter Lawrence & Leonard Williams our pass rush will be fucking scary.
I mean, we'll probably all end up with with our takes!
I agree with half your statements. :)
Almost every TE is more scheme dependent than WRs unfortunately. Some teams force their TE to block like an offensive tackle even though they signed a 6’4 240 guy. Other teams split their TEs out in the slot all day and let them attack vertically.
Among armchair scouts, I think it's the lack of a RAS score to go gaga over.
There's 31 other teams, the fact some people think a player 'will probably end up in ...' is mental
Oh I don’t like his game either, but I can’t accept that I’m right in my take on a highly rated prospect
He had double his iowa career receiving yards in his one year at Purdue. If he's at Purdue his entire career, he probably winds up a 3rd rounder, maybe a bit higher.   Unfortunately for Iowa fans, I think most people will associate him with Purdue instead of the  Hawkeyes when he succeeds in the NFL.
If that’s the case then let’s switch it up to Levi’s. I haven’t been super active in this sub this off-season so was going off small sample size.
As one of the few Levis Lovers, I follow the beatitudes.  “Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God. Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake (this one is Levis), for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.”
He has a decent group of supporters, but he’s also got a lot more haters than Levis at the same time. Richardson is just the more polarizing prospect, whereas nobody is really talking about Levis that much.
the QB actually has to be good AND be getting unnecessary shit.
I hope he goes to the Jets so they have Juice and Sauce on the same team
I don’t think he will fall past the Bills pick. He is a perfect fit for them.
He’s raw for sure but it’s easy to see the vision with him.
They are entitled to their opinions. I like him.  Edited the comment I see... The video doesn't lie. Lol
It’s just another one of those frame situations where people consider him as a red flag to take in the first round. if he was 180 then he’d probably go in the first round but he’s barely 160 so people view him as another Tutu Atwell.   It honestly is a good thing he slips because if your team really likes him they’ll be getting a huge value pick in the mid rounds.
I totally agree. Someone as athletic as he is should've gotten more than .5 a sack in 30 college games just by accident.
Hey it's a hot take
You and me both, brother. You also an ECU fan or just a fan of shifty and speedy RBs?
Tune?
What if Richardson moves to another position?
Are you guys trading up for a qb again?
The Ojulari brothers, Kayvon, Dexter Lawrence and Leonard Williams is pretty nasty
I think it depends on a combination of how good the offensive line is, how good their RB/FB is at blocking, and if the QB has a good sense of pressure in the pocket/ability to extend plays.  Not saying that Mahomes makes Kelce - he's almost certainly a HoF talent anywhere - but I suspect if Mahomes wasn't... well, Mahomes, Kelce would be expected to block more often.
Cool
And it's not as if he was a Jalen Carter or Dexter Lawrence type, not putting up sacks but clearly being a great pass rusher to anyone that watched. His PFF pass rush grade was 68! That's honestly worse than the 0.5 sacks, because it shows it wasn't just bad luck, he's just terrible at it
True, but your hot take would fit McKee way more than Hooker.
The QB from Houston.  He’s pretty good
I'd honestly expect him to play multiple positions, at least in his first season or two. He's too inaccurate to be a starting QB, but he's an absolute athletic freak. He'll play somewhere.
When Love has a couple MVP seasons and wants some help to get one more ring we probably will
My hot take is also limited by not watching college football, I just parrot things I heard
I want him
Based
Welcome to r/NFL_Draft!
Honestly most of /r/NFL as well, even people w/ very strong opinions on the draft
Can't wait for tomorrow where we learn from another reporter that the Panthers are "all in on CJ Stroud at #1"
Cool. I like Stroud.  Also, if they pick Stroud, I like Young.  We’re on to pick 12 fellas
Looking like a white snake music video with all this smoke going on 😭
Man, Mort seems like he’s really struggling, sad to see it.
I hope he's right. I like Stroud too, but I just can't shake the impression that Bryce is a savant.
FWIW, Breer, Jeremiah, Lance Z all think Bryce is going 1
11 of 12 executives for the Panthers love Bryce Young
This is all speculation. Nobody knows anything until the draft.
Feels like more insider types that connect panthers to young use more definitive statements like Mort did, or will straight up say that’s what they’re hearing like Breer. Where the insiders connecting panthers to Stroud just are making an assumption based on size when you dig into what they actually say. Could be wrong and, but I feel more of the insider smoke has been on young. The talking head smoke has been on stroud. I know the Vegas odds don’t reflect this, but I feel it’s Young
I really think the #1 pick will be Bryce Young.  Idk why, just a gut feeling and I feel like the Stroud hype is all smoke.  Could see a Baker Mayfield situation where up until I think the day of the draft everyone was saying Darnold, then suddenly it was leaked the pick is going to be Baker.
No risk if wrong, all the credit if they’re right.   Doing takes in the media is the easiest job in the world. Even easier than meteorologists lol.
Nobody can deny Young’s ability, the problem is his ability to avoid big hits and have a career arc similar to Tua or Kyler.
Stetson Bennett going first overall confirmed?
This makes the most sense. Bryce Young is the best QB in the class, and it behooves the Panthers to take the best QB.
Just pick the best qb and don’t overthink it
Right or wrong, I'm on my way to the nearest Walmart... One knee after the other
Only 22 days to go lol
Obviously they are going to trade the #1 for Malik Willis so they can get Cam to back him up…
I’m by no means an expert, but I believe that this will be a mistake. I don’t want Carolina to fail, but I am having a hard time seeing Young being successful. Hope I’m wrong.
Mortensen is notoriously full of shit.
Bryce Young will be in the NFL for 10+ years. Now starter v backup? Who knows, but what he can add for a QB room is impeccable. I have no idea what CJ Stroud’s football IQ is, but Bryce seems to be off the charts.
Can someone explain to me why the first overall pick holder wouldn’t just be completely transparent about who they are picking? They are competing with nobody; no team can affect their selection by picking that player first. What’s the point of smoke screening the first overall fucking pick. PLEASE. SOMEONE EXPLAIN WHAT THEY GAIN FROM THIS.
The "Frank Reich only likes tall QBs" crowd eating crow shit rn.  Edit: I know, I know. Tomorrow we'll be back to then drafting Stroud.  But on Friday it will be back to Young and they'll for sure eat shit!
This basically guarantees Stroud is the pick. Zierlein called this a week or two ago. The smokescreens are gonna pick up heavy, specifically Panthers and Bryce Young talk.  The Panthers are gonna see if they can bait a pick out of the Texans if the Texans feel that Bryce is their guy significantly more than Stroud.
Bruce muthafuckin Yung it is!
I’d be pissed if I was a Panthers fan
Heard somebody other than Bryce Young could be in consideration as well. Bit of a rumor at this point but maybe there's something there.
Waiting for the reports that the Carolina Panthers may be interested in trading back in the draft from #1.
I have no idea.  All I know is short QBs usually don’t work out in the NFL.
& 11 of 12 footballs were deflated Chris, yeah *okay*
he’s gonna be a bust. he’s 5’10 180 lbs ffs, why is he even on draft boards
Panthers fucked lol
Spoilers
Smoke.
It’s cj
I don’t think he can be constantly sacked. He might get injured alot
Shocker 😱
I CAN STILL SEE, NOT ENOUGH SMOKESCREEN!!!
They think he’ll be the new Cam Newton
“Jerk store is the line!”  ## “JERK STORE!”
They (Panthers) all love CJ Stroud
Friday: Sources say Panthers investigating how to fuse Stroud, Richardson, Young into one Machamp-like creature and draft it at #1
I thought we were all in on Anthony Richardson 🤔
Tony Pauline said today on Atlanta sports radio, “All I’m hearing is that the Panthers FO wants Stroud. The only hold out is Frank Reich who wants Anthony Richardson. Haven’t heard anything about Young.”
The next day “Report: Panthers infatuated by Aidan O’Connell”
Come draft day they select Anthony Richardson baby
Then draft day comes and they pick Stetson Bennett
Smoke SZN
At this point I don't understand why it isn't a crime to just lie and mislead people while claiming to be a journalist or an expert. They make stuff up, slander players, spread rumors, and shill for owners like Dan Snyder. When these Insiders are letting guys like Bruce Allen write their articles for them it's just a joke.   They even stoop to bribery and stealing medical records. Trust no one, question everything. Anytime you hear these idiots say the talked to, "team executives" or "People within the Organization" You know it's a straight made up story. When they are spitting rumors from reddit as gospel and they are stealing conspiracy theories from Youtube hacks it's just all so very pathetic.
As an old school ESPN fan it saddens me that Mort is seen as just another click bait reporter.
The chyron at the bottom is already saying that. lol
Kings of smokescreens
I cannot wait to revisit this draft in three years. Texans seem like they’re in a win-win situation, Bears are loaded with picks, and what if the Lions have another good or great draft? Two firsts and four picks in the top 55, if they nail those picks they could finally be a team setup to succeed for years.
I don’t think y’all can lose with your pick. Even if the guy that falls to you is just average it won’t matter because you don’t have a what if. Any sane person would make your choice.   The Panthers right now have to make the right choice. It’s Tua vs Herbert but with the number 1 pick this time.
In this scenario, take Stroud at 2 and JSN at 12. Now you have a WR1 that your new QB is already familiar with and has proven to be a successful combo. If I'm the GM, I can't think of a safer set of picks that still have amazing upside
You might be able to package 2 and 12 to secure 1 if you really must. Fritterer is arguably the best negotiator in the league though so you might have to give up more.
Except it's Frank Reich grinding on the hood of a car
“IS THIS LOVE?”
I never understand misdirection with the number 1 overall pick. Who cares who you're taking there. You're not gonna have some other team swoop in and ruin your plans or anything.
You think this is related to the cancer? I’d think throat cancer would just change your voice somehow, or take away your voice completely.  He seems like he’s struggling to form words and sentences.
Yeah look, I am empathic to illness…. But why would you want to go on TV like that?. Let’s remember the old Mort
I've fallen for Bryce too hard.
Bryce is the better QB. You’ll just have to protect him well. But is it better to a have a fragile good QB or a durable bad QB?
If he was 6’3 and 220 he’d be the clear #1 same as luck, burrow, or Lawrence. And guys with that talent eventually always prove those that over looked them because of a boomer hold out reason wrong. Like Brees and Murray. He’s not the exact same as them, he has other size set backs. But he has the talent. As a fan that wants to be excited, he should absolutely have you feeling over the moon until proven otherwise.
Stroud is getting overrated from the Georgia game. He weirdly had lots of space/time to make several key plays, was not exactly under duress for most of it.   McShay also said he had a guy he swears by tell him that Young is the Panthers’ guy. So I’m inclined to believe that.
Completely unrelated to performance, he also has that Cam-esque smile... y'know, one that has just enough confidence to not seem overly cocky but also brings a lot of energy and "yo, I got this."  Stroud, on the other hand, has a face with punch-ability similar to Sean Payton (both greats in their respective positions though, hence why this comment is more of a shitpost)
Ever seen that video of those old dutch falconers releasing a Kestrel near a motorway? [Err doesn't go well...](https://youtu.be/wkuo7-sefEQ)  Part of me worries first snap he goes careening head first into an on coming truck.  I'm sure he'll be fine but still just a little worry lol
I think the cat’s been out of the bag for ~2 weeks now. Word seems to have gone around that Bryce Young is the guy.
That is a nice deep cut, and I appreciate it.
I don't think it is. I trust Mort on these kind of things.
Don't some of the teams know?
Picking Young is a huge mistake. He’s small and not just in height but weight. He’s a very  talented and skilled qb but a 5’9” 180lb QB getting sacked by the full force of a 6’3 330lb Defensive Tackle is insane. There’s no way it’s sustainable. I know people make comparisons to Kyler but just forget about the measurables and look at them. Kyler is much stockier and muscular. Bryce young is just a very tiny guy. Watch this video of the two of them side by side https://twitter.com/ESPNCFB/status/1586080115984941063 Kyler looks taller and a lot bulkier than young.
How much credit can you really even give.  I think people would be more surprised if Young wasn't the pick at 1.  Like it's not guaranteed but it's not like they're making some longshot prediction
Tua is an anomaly. He may be concussion prone, unlucky, and also have been completely mishandled all in one. Looking back at it, was it really worth jeopardizing the kids career for a TNF game vs Burrow? Me thinks not and most people would have told you it was a bad idea before the game.   I think Young won’t have to rely on scrambling like Kyler does. IMO the biggest risk to young is that he gets hit in the pocket and his “204” pound frame can’t handle it.
But what if he isn't??
Yeah that is not his rep at all. He's very accurate most of the time
Talent-wise, he absolutely is good enough to play in the NFL for a decade. But his frame makes me doubt he'll last more than five.
The Panthers could be content with taking either so they are just doing their due diligence in deciding who to take. It could legitimately still be up in the air. The only reason that you try to shield your intentions is to build a smokescreen to entice a trade up. Clearly Carolina is taking either Stroud or Young so the only team they would be willing to trade down with is Houston. This only works if Carolina has no preference between Stroud/Young and the Texans do.   This begs the question of why didn't they just trade up to two instead of one in the first place. That answer is fairly obvious. The Texans are not willing to move down to any pick lower than two. The only way to get the second pick is to trade up to one and back down to two. Houston could have been interested in the first pick all along but from Chicago's perspective, they were never getting as much from Houston to move down one spot as they got from Carolina. Houston was not willing to give up as much relative value and Chicago couldn't count on getting the same haul trading down twice. Now you could see Houston and Carolina flip and Carolina recoups some picks and Houston gets their choice of QB. I think that's a longshot but if you're Carolina, there is no downside to trying.  What all this really tells me is Carolina is not completely sold on who to take. If they were unequivocally sold on either, they wouldn't be  interested in moving down to two and there'd be absolutely no reason for a smokescreen and you wouldn't get reports that contradict each other. They could tell their choice not to work out for other teams so he doesn't risk injury and they could start negotiating the contract.
I imagine the NFL would ask them to not announce until the draft to drive viewership to the show.  Ratings ratings ratings.
Nobody is eating any crow shit about this until the draft actually happens
Texans ain't moving
You don't pay a king's ransom for #1 to risk losing out on your prospect. Everyone in the organization should be fired if Carolina trades from #1 to #2.
I could be mistaken but didn't Lance Zierlein himself say that he thinks Young will be the pick at 1?
Because he has a fucking Heisman?
i heard they were crying over him
They create an abomination of Young's size, Richardson's accuracy, Stroud's Alma mater, and then somehow manage to throw in Levis' eating habits.
Human Centipede: NFL QB Special Edition
I heard from my cousin’s friend’s dad’s uncle’s coworker at Nintendo the Panthers are all in on Will Levis
I know Frank Reich *loves* Levis on Thursdays, so I guess Richardson doesn't come back around for another couple of media cycles
Have to see what the Madden ratings look like before we can know for sure
Tony Pauline also said that there were top players on the team that weren’t a fan of Reich and that didn’t turn out to be true sooo…
Got a link to that?
Reminds me of Jared Goff/Carson Wentz.  Hopefully, Young/Stroud goes better...
Putting aside how we actually ended up in out current situation, I'm glad we don't have to deal with the "what if" with the pick itself, and can take who is left.
As a Bears fan it feels amazing to have good draft capital for the first time in awhile
>Texans seem like they’re in a win-win situation  You need to learn more about Texans history.
I'm in an ongoing debate at work that the Lions could match or beat the 49ers this year.
They could definitely lose with their pick. There are rumblings that they don’t go QB if the Panthers take Young and then draft Levis later.
I really just wouldn’t care to. They’re both good prospects and neither is without flaw. No reason to give up anything to buy a choice between two relatively equal prospects IMO.
2 and 12 is already way too rich in this context, imo
Yo wtf.
Well there is a line of thinking that if they really are cool with either Stroud or Young, they can try to goad Houston into giving up some picks to ensure they get who they want.  But realistically I think the NFL just asks whoever picks #1 to be ambiguous so more people watch.
It's the throat cancer - it changes your voice, makes it much harder to talk, swallow, really anything. There's no effect to his brain or procession or anything like that, but it becomes a struggle to get your mouth around the words you want to say.
Because he loves what he does for a living and doesn't give a fuck about people asking and saying exactly what you just did, probably. Just if I had to guess.
Douche chills
Someone who is empathetic to his illness wouldn’t post this lol
It's empathetic, dillweed, and you are obviously the opposite of that. "Look, I'm am an empath, totally feel for you, but your disease grosses me out, could you not let me see it ever?" Bit late, but I just figured I'd tell you how embarrassingly idiotic you sound in your callousness.
Dawg, if Steve Smith is "salivating" watching him, then I'm goddamn smitten
Stroud is clearly better
Don't they have a decent line? Or is that Houston?
Not the question. Obviously A. But the real question is, do you think he’s so much better that he’s worth a greater risk for someone that was only a bit better in college? If the answer is you think the more prone guy has a significantly higher ceiling, you risk it and get your guy. If you’re comparing like qb6 in the league and qb 9-11 it’s a different convo.  Your comparison would basically be A top starter Vs. a backup. Obviously you go A regardless of risk. But I don’t think Stroud is viewed like that currently. Otherwise he’d go in the 3rd.
He was pressured on 43% of his dropbacks in the UGA game lol
What game were you watching? Dude was under heavy pressure and made some incredible plays to escape that pressure.
McShay said that and then came out with a mock that had CJ #1 today lol.  Who f knows.
Here's him in the Peach Bowl for reference: https://youtu.be/vsPHomKJiAA  I do think he had a lot of really clean pockets but also faced a fair amount of pressure and made some really nice plays to escape it. Outside of those few plays from both the O-Line and Stroud, they were both just fine when it came to handling the Georgia D-Line. I do agree that people are kind of overrating how he did in that game though.
Tell me you didn't watch the game without telling me you didn't watch the game.
https://youtu.be/oZmzYoJnHJc
Vegas still has Stroud favored to go #1 so...nope, not really.
That's what I don't get about them sending a small army to Stroud's pro day. Were they trying to talk some in to, or out of, drafting Stroud?
I hope Mort the person is doing well.   I hope Mort the reporter the very worst.
The only person who truly knows is Reich.
Sometimes we see the contract negotiation happen prior to the draft. Mario Williams had one set prior to everyone thinking the Texans would take Reggie Bush. The contract was revealed and then everyone knew he would be the first pick.
5’9 180? He was 5’10 1/8 and 204 2 weeks ago lol.
More people will likely say “wow mort called it” then people will look back and say “ha mort was wrong”.
The size isn’t just about injuries in my opinion. A lot of Young’s college game was being able to move in the pocket and find lanes to make the throws. NFL pockets are just tighter than in College and idk if he’ll be able to find those lanes in the NFL.
As of today he definitely is the best.  5 years from now it might be Hooker for all we know but for today it’s definitely Young.
But what if Stroud isn't? If Levis is the best? Or AT? Or some other dude. We really can't know. But that's why Bryce is the safest. His work ethic in the film room, pre/post snap recognition, and how he prepares. He actually helped the coaches gameplan every week at Bama. You bet on the smarts and work ethic if everything else is equal. Thing is, it isn't equal. Bryce is also incredible on the field as well. Best QB at dealing with high intensity situations in this draft.   He's a safer bet, but no one is a true lock to be the best.
He is absolutely the best QB in the class. He doesn't have the best build for it, but when it comes to playing the position he's second to none this year.
He's a mouthpiece of the league office. He just says whatever they tell him to say. He's full of shit most of the time and clearly trying to push an agenda the rest.
Here's the thing, no one eats "crow" they eat jackdaw.
I didn’t say they were. I said this is why you get reports like this. It’s a smokescreen to see if the Texans will get desperate for a certain guy
You never know if they don’t try.  It has been funny that since we’ve started putting out this Bryce energy out into the universe, the Texans have started to be like.  “Maybe we won’t even take a QB…”  If our front office is split or like them near equally, but the Texans value one way more than the other, it just makes sense to try and get a little something in return.
Let's appreciate how Love Smith fucked them well and good in the last game.
Idk, if the main goal is to build a contender with a QB on a rookie contract…. Trading up and trading back, and roughly breaking even… getting a top 2 QB in class is a huge win.
He did but that’s just his guess. Bryce is #1 on his board anyways. Not really related to why he was saying the Panthers will smokescreen though.
He also had a weird ass mock draft that he posted. Maybe the worst I have ever seen lol
That's why we know it won't be Young
And he’s the best QB in this draft class, lol.
I'm a Bryce Stan but that's a terrible argument. You know how many bad nfl qbs have won the Heisman, right?
No that's DJM they were crying about!
I heard they all went to Walmart and dropped to their knees over him
Good thing, the smokescreen is working on everyone including ourselves and we're going to be able to get Hooker instead
I guess it's pretty serious.
Meanwhile Jerry Richardson preferred Levi's on Fridays.
Oh I don’t doubt it - was just responding to the person saying they couldn’t wait till tomorrow when someone else says Stroud’s the guy
Don't know how Pauline is as a pro personnel reporter but his draft stuff I believe he's one of the more reliable
It was live on radio, so I do not unless someone posted the quote to Twitter
Well both of those teams ended up winning a Super Bowl so it could’ve been a lot worse 🤷🏻‍♂️
Both of them went to the Super Bowl to be fair
Or Winston/Mariota.
Sonics got this when they were gifted Kevin Durant instead of Greg Oden. It can work out really well with no regrets! (So long as your team doesn’t move)
> Putting aside how we actually ended up in out current situation  "Putting aside the 'what if' of the situation, I'm glad we don't have to deal with the 'what if'"
That's stupid. If the Texans are interested in doing that, there is no way they'd stay at 2 and select a non QB. The option is to take one of Stroud/Young at 2 or trade down. If they don't see much difference between Stroud and Levis then the only right move is to trade back. But what happens if they trade back and take a non-QB at 4 or wherever they land and then Levis is gone by 12. There's no way they risk that. The GM is done for in that scenario. They aren't going to risk it. They stay at 2 and take a QB
Whoever you get at #2 with a guy to help him out at #12 is going to be better than trading those two picks to get #1 and having the "better" QB but no help.  Young and Stroud are both prospects whose success will be determined in large part by the talent that surrounds them.
Kids.. don't smoke
Yeah, Morty was a bit of a douche, but let’s think of him differently
Your photo looks like you have Marfan Syndrome. Maybe that’s why you are so sensitive?
Should be good if healthy
People just make shit up don't they?
I mean just go back and watch the game. Did he get sacked/pressured at times? Of course.   But the majority of his big completions, he had a clean pocket with lots of space. And other pressures came from him holding the ball too long. That’s a theme I notice with Stroud, he takes a long time to get rid of it.
UGA blitzed him on like 50% of his drop backs lmao
I did say it was a shitpost lmao but yeah not my best idea
You do realize these types of reports are what cause Vegas to shift odds right?  We saw it happen with Hutchinson to Walker last year the exact same way. Hutchinson was the favorite since the Combine and once a lot of insiders started to connect Travon Walker to Jacksonville (and to a lesser extent Detroit) the money flipped during draft week.  Y'all got to stop acting like Vegas odds-makers are all-knowing being. They function a lot like these reporters where they make assumptions based on tendencies and when they hear new information they adjust accordingly.
Vegas odds are just based on people placing bets…lol
They had the same large group for the 4 QBs pro days.
I think it would be idiotic to give up what they did for the pick and not do due diligence all the way up to the last minute with these guys.  To just make the trade and call it a day on your evaluation process two months before the draft is nonsense.
I can only speak for how we handled things, but we sent a bunch of folks to every QB's pro day & a smaller group for Baker, cause Dorsey was totally set on him. Sending a lot of guys to a pro day doesn't necessarily mean they're all-in on that guy.
Due diligence
There could be a whole team of decision-makers at the Panthers who know who the pick is. Mort really isn't one to make things up, at least when it comes to Eagles news. I think he's plugged in with Reich as well since he was early on the Wentz-to-Colts story.
Right...3 people in that entire organization know what their thought process is, and they all get paid millions to keep it quiet.   No clue why people ever believe these media leaks on super high level stuff like this.
Weird how all the sudden he’s 25 lbs heavier than he’s ever been on the day that they weigh him. He obviously bulked just for the combine. And I call bullshit on 5’10 Kyler Murray is 5’10” and is taller than bryce young
He's not going to play anywhere close to 204lbs. He put on a bunch of bad weight for his weigh in
Counterpoint: nah.
You think the safest is the 5'10" 200 pound guy?  If you don't know who the best is, you are also guessing at who the safest is.
[x] confidently names the Best QB in the draft  [x] seen this before  [x] usually wrong
Ah I see you're mad he was the Deflategate reporter. How dare he propose the totally unprecedented idea that the Patriots might cheat to win games!
How are you a stan and you don’t know why he’s on draft boards? You must have seen some of his ability i imagine
Reports say they collapsed to their knees and wailed in sorrow when they told DJ.
I kinda hate that we're gonna get clowned on for years over a fanfic DJ's agent made up lmao
Surprise, another smokescreen. Yall are weirdly trading the #1 pick for Aaron Rodgers after he took ownership on an ayuahsca trip
found it! thank you  https://twitter.com/wesandwalker/status/1643797776575213568
And neither of them won it with those QBs, that's pretty funny actually
That's really vexing that two teams that sacrificed a lot to draft two QBs, ultimately won a Championship within a few years, without either one being their starting QB.
Subscribe
Because the other team has to agree? You can't just make some trade lol.
Because that’s an incredibly lopsided trade?
Mort might like what he does, but he hasn't brought anything great for about 5 years. Literally adds nothing. People might be afraid to say it.  He's not one of the best talents they can find. So then what are we doing?
What
Doubling down, bold strategy Cotton
Dude had half a dozen beers and remembers 2 plays where he had a strangely long time in the pocket and something memorable happened and that’s all he remembers. Make shit up? Yes. Intentionally? Not necessarily, memories be like that. If you really want to make smart takes you’re gonna have to look at the stats and then re watch every play and focus on one player.
Stroud  had an average time to throw of 2.77ish. NFL average is around 2.71   But yeah, he takes too long to throw it. 🙄
That’s how a majority of big plays occur  People be finding shit to make up about Stroud. I saw every snap of his career. You’re literally holding big plays in the natty against him. Lol  I’d suggest watching more than that game. You’ll find that he’s pretty much a fucking beast in every game.  Know who wasn’t surprised about the OSU game? OSU fans! The only thing different about the national championship game was that he ran. Everything else was just CJ being CJ.
Vegas function less on reporters and more on money. Even before reporters break something you better believe there are a bunch of people with inside info already placing bets. And since draft betting has limits, it's really clear who the people with info are because they are surely betting the limit everywhere they can. This happened most recently in the NBA draft when Jabari Smith was heavy favorite to go #1 until some guy literally just bet everything on Banchero number 1 like one day before the draft. It was the news media for Jabari vs. some unknown guy with lots of money on the line for Banchero. Guess who won?
Lmao Vegas has a better idea than we do on this stuff and only shift their odds "because of a report" to hedge their bets IE too many people betting one way, or because the report is official
Agreed, but they sent [11 people](https://www.sportingnews.com/uk/nfl/news/cj-stroud-pro-day-panthers-nfl-draft-pick/umpy8ig60ylitiyy5citrdan) to his pro day. That's a bit more than due diligence IMO. I think they're taking Stroud.
Our GM literally just did an interview with the Athletic where he said he doesn’t even know Reich’s preferred QB for sure, and Reich doesn’t know his. They won’t have fully made up their mind until a week or two before the draft.  Not two weeks ago people were assuming it was a forgone conclusion we were taking Stroud. Now our staff has made a concerted effort to talk up Bryce, and the media and fans think it is a forgone conclusion we are taking Bryce.  No one knows who the top pick is right now, they might closer to the draft, but they’re just parroting shit until then. Who knows what’s real.
I mean, that’s kind of the point of reporters jobs, lol. They have sources within organizations and use that to put info out there.  I can’t tell if you’re being sarcastic though, but I’m sure more than 3 people in the organization knows who we’re picking by this point.
It was an official combine measurement and idk if you know but gaining 25 pounds isn’t as easy as you are making it seem. Yes I aware he plays closer to 190 but he’s 21 and has plenty of time to build on his frame. He is the best processor and Stroud or whichever QB you prefer will never be able to process better than BY. But yeah “Big QB Good” is a great way to evaluate prospects. I’m sure you loved Brock Osweiler and Paxton Lynch coming out
Kyler obviously bulked for the draft too. Just go back and look at the threads of measuring in. Same shit different year. They were the same size at the time of the draft. I would not doubt if kyler is bigger than him now in that picture after 3 years in the NFL and having another half inch of growth considering some people don't stop fully growing until early to mid 20s. At their combines, they were both 5'10 1/8" and around 205(3lb difference). Only difference is Bryce is lankier cause he has arms that are 2 inches longer(important for height of passes) and has bigger hands by a quarter inch.
Yes, because he was the best at playing the position of QB in college, and the skills he has translate. ESPECIALLY his intelligence, preparation, how he doesnt wilt under pressure(both physical and mental), and how slow the game is for him.   Also, his weight doesn't scare me in the current NFL with the way they protect QBs. He got hit a TON at Bama and his only injury was one he gave himself on a noncontact play. Bama was 103rd in sacks given up in 2021, Bryce got hit constantly, but still played well enough to win the Heisman and dominated the best D in UGA(played better in that NC game than his stats show too). He also throws over the middle of the field more than the other 3 top prospects despite being the shortest.   I think Bryce has by far the highest floor, which makes him the safest. All 4 guys have immense ceilings, but I think AR's is obviously the highest with his physical gifts.
It's weird you're on your knees for a reporter that spread spurious, false information straight from the league office and then refused to retract.
The op is acting like he's a top prospect because he's a Heisman winner. That doesn't mean shit lmao.  He's a top prospect because of his talent.
Gnashing teeth and rending garments, casting ash upon their heads, etc etc.
Walmart has never been the same
Were they at a large retailer?
Having both of those QBs was incredibly important to winning their super bowls so there’s that at least.
That's true, but add a pick of two and I think we'd be willing to take that deal if it truly is 1a, 1b for us.
I didn't say it was rational. The media will definitely make a story out of nothing and force some talking point, though.
Legacy and he is friends with the people making those choices
OSU didn’t play in the national championship while Stroud was QB
>	i saw every snap of his career  I did too, he’s going to bust and i feel sorry for the team that takes the guy carried by 3 potential all pro nfl wr’s that couldn’t beat Michigan or win a big game in his life.
That kind of emphasizes my point. Vegas odds are fickle and it's weird to use odds that have historically changed close to draft day as a solid justification for why something will happen.
They sent that many to all the QBs (except maybe AR due to owners meetings)
Mort does, that's why he reported it
The sources these reporters have are pissed off assistant to the assistant linebackers coach making 22K a year for 80 hour weeks, or a security guard who overheard some chatter. None of those guys know what's going on, and none of the guys who know what's going on are willing to trade their million dollar salary for informing the public early of who the pick is going to be.   This is why the vast majority of this kind of stuff doesn't get leaked until it's closed.
Literally no one is saying "Big QB Good" or else it would be between Young and Richardson.  If Bryce Young wins the superbowl he will be the smallest QB to ever do it. Acknowledging that fact and taking it into consideration isn't "Big QB Good". And implying that anyone who's considers that only cares about size as an evaluator is extremely condescending and reductive.
Kyler Murray is an extremely good QB probably top 10 in the league but you’re ridiculous if you don’t think he has injury concerns. He playing weight is ACTUALLY around 200 so it’s legitimate that someone smaller carrying 10-15lbs less muscle is more likely to have injury concerns as wel
People made that joke about him taking a 10 lb shit after the weigh in and took it seriously lmao. I'd say he put on 5 lbs at most to get into 200 territory. Putting on 10+% of your bodyweight in that timeframe is really hard to do, especially with an athletic lifestyle.
My responses:  1. Colt McCoy (college performance) 2. Kyler Murray & Tua (size and injuries) 3. Josh Rosen (you just think his floor is highest)  If Bryce Young were there at 10 and I'm drafting, I'm trading that pick for someone who is desperate to draft a small QB.
Not sure you know but Heisman = talented. People that win Heismans get drafted. Tell me one that won one and wasn't on draft boards
Were they lamenting???
For real. Sure Wentz and Goff didn’t work out in the end, but I don’t think either the Rams or Eagles win their super bowls without having drafted them first.
It may as well have been the natty. Whoever won that game was beating TCU.
This. 100% I feel so strongly this way, since I root for the Panthers as well, I hop they take Young, then the Raiders trade up for the Texans pick, because I'd hate to see Houston take another brutal hit by drafting Stroud, and I'd love to see yet another bust for the Raiders. Not going to happen, but that would be my perfect scenario, since I am 100% certain Stroud will bust, since OSU systemically cannot produce NFL caliber QBs.
I see what he's saying though. They say the House Always Wins for a reason.
Considering the biggest reason people rank Stroud over Young is height proves the “Big QB good” take
Kyler’s injuries have absolutely nothing to do with his size lmao
I would say he put on probably 10-15 pounds and I think that is the reason he did not throw at the combine. His playing weight will probably be around 195 year 1, but with the right staff he could easily get above 200 and stay there for his career
He's better than Colt ever came close to being, in every aspect of the position. Murray hasn't been injured from hits, his have been soft tissue stuff. Tua was much more prone to injury in college too, despite being taller and thicker. Josh Rosen was smart and prepared fairly well, but couldn't make that apply in the game itself. He also wasn't in the same universe as Bryce under pressure. Bryce is an absolute dawg.   Bryce's worst overall game as a starter, is actually the game that convinced me he would succeed at the next level. It was the final drive in regulation of the 2021 Iron Bowl. That drive solidified him as a prospect for me. He had taken a beating all day. Had been sacked 7 times, and had been hit on basically every single drop back for 4 quarters. To start that drive he has an atrocious oline, no timeouts, 1.5 minutes, an extraordinarily hostile crowd, and the ball on his own 3 yard line. The only other recent QB that I think would even have a chance of pulling off a win in that situation is Burrow. Bryce is a stone cold killer on the football field.
That doesn't mean you're going to succeed in the NFL?
Chris Weinke, Eric Crouch in back to back years. Jason White didn’t event get drafted in the NFL, Troy Smith drafted in 5th round of NFL,
Oh heavens, yes
I wouldn’t say Goff hasn’t worked out. It wasn’t Goffs fault that McVay made him completely dependent on his calls to the point that Belichick exposed them for it in the Super Bowl by having the Defense adjust in 10 seconds to the play call. The Rams got out coached completely in their first Super Bowl. And Goff has looked pretty good for the Lions. I’d wager Goff gets the Lions their first playoff win this year and has been one of their brightest spots on offense.
So true.   That was definitely the real championship game in college football last season.
A guy being one of the shortest ever prospects for the number one pick is a valid concern. By succeeding in the NFL he'd literally be doing something no one else has ever done. It's not like he's Drew Brees or Russell Wilson. He's shorter than the best short quarterbacks ever.  I don't think a QB is better because he's bigger, but I do think that size might play a factor in the success of one of the smallest prospects ever.  That all being said, I'll be happy if the Panthers draft Young, but size is still a *significant* concern.
Bryce Young is about to be the shortest AND lightest first round quarterback ever drafted. He's really good but you simply cannot deny he is a physical outlier
He's also not top 10 lol
He bulked up for the NFL. Adding muscle mass can increase the possibility of soft tissue injuries
McCown mentioned it in his analysis video, but you can tell the kid is still strong as an ox. His core strength is pretty great because he was still able to shake off the occasional rusher. I wouldn't be surprised if he was only at like 10-15% bodyfat,
How many of Colt's games did you see?  Put some respect on his name.
Tell me where I said that. And also tell me a better metric that successful NFL players have in common in college
So all those got drafted except Jason White, thanks for proving my point... In general they all get drafted except for special cases, especially in modern times, I'd argue there isn't a better predictor for getting drafted. Can't believe we're arguing this
The NFL has changed significantly in the last few years to protect the QBs and I believe he will be able to survive the modern NFL.
Stroud is only 210
Maybe not in 2022 but he's not a bad QB by any means. Most of his shortcomings are from behavioral concerns anyway, of which Bryce certainly doesn't have. Kid lives for the game, he's a dawg
> How many of Colt's games did you see? >  > Put some respect on his name.  Quite a few. Was an excellent college QB, and a competent NFL backup. I'm 36, though I realize most of this sub was under the age of 10 when Colt played, lol.
A better metric? I'd say film? Someone winning a Heisman should be at the bottom of the list of why I'd draft a player. I'm not going to look at 2 players and go "yeah let's draft him because he won a Heisman".
Sorry I thought you were implying that winning heisman made you a top prospect since that’s what the person posted which you replied to.   Getting drafted in 7 rounds doesn’t make you a top prospect in my opinion
Stroud is really 210lbs though. Young is really at best 180lbs
All players have film in common lol including bad and undrafted players, I was talking about besides that
The original premise was about him being on draft boards. u/I2ecover made it about being a top prospect
Young will almost definitely be drafted #1 but even if not he's not going to be available at 7.  I'm assuming we're going to see Raiders trying to get to 2 at least.
RAPERport?
If the Raiders offered the Texans the 7th overall pick and Chase Garbers for the 2nd overall pick, how could they turn that down?
If Carolina or Houston take either Richardson or Levis, Arizona would almost certainly trade down, right? They could either get a haul for some team desperate for Bryce/Stroud or get the Colts to at least give up something and still get Anderson
[Jimmy G right now](https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/01eVRncJDQd2wr8xPoCTyzw/hero-image.fill.size_1200x900.v1614271530.png)
There is a world where Young is there at 3, and Vegas trades up. It's unlikely, but I wouldn't say it's crazy
Wtf would LV give up for 2? The Texans are taking QB no matter what anyone tells me.
Stroud goes 1 imo.
Almost definitely? He’s a +200 underdog atm
They won't get to 2.   Texans will get Stroud if Young is taken 1st. Best the Raiders could do is leapfrog the Colts and trade for 3rd.
Interesting that a giants fan knows more than us panthers fans, lol. To us, it’s pretty much 50/50 right now and will likely be that way until the moment that the pick is made. Actually I’d say it’s more like 49/49/2 with Anthony Richardson being the 2% lol  Also Vegas has Bryce as the underdog vs Stroud, so take that how you will…  But anyway I really can’t picture a scenario in which Houston even considers trading the pick away to anyone except Carolina. And I can’t really see that happening either
No chance that happens.
They'd be trying to get to 3. The Texans aren't trading out when they need a QB, *especially* not to a team that also needs a QB.
C'mon op. Yeesh.
Maybe something new we’ll learn about Ian?
They should offer the 7th pick and McDaniels
Texans need a QB, that's how they turn that down.
In this scenario, sure, but it isn’t going to happen. There’s a small chance one of Young/Stroud is there at 3, but no way in hell would both be there.
The Raiders going for Young at 2 or 3 would be a competent front office move. Which tells me they 100% would draft Anthony Richardson after moving up
There is absolutely no world where Young is there at 3 lol
Only thing that could make them question the pick would be if the panthers take Bryce and they aren’t high on Stroud.
It all depends on how you frame it. "We're giving you the chance to be the #1 pick next year with McDaniels!"
Obviously Chase Garbers plays QB.
That's not what he's saying. He's saying that it's possible that one of them is there and the Raiders can trade up to 3. Both wouldn't need to be there. It's also unlikely either are available. Stroud and Young will go 1-2 but the Raiders are just doing their due diligence just in case one falls
Is there not a really fast receiver with no other skills available ?
It's possible that Stroud and Richardson go 1-2. It's also possible I get my wife to give me a BJ. They both seem just as likely.
I suppose. Tanking for Caleb Williams is the only way it makes sense to me.
Ah, I must’ve misread it.
Hey you guys are being mean
Al Davis is nodding his head in approval
Which is what they'll do😎
Al Davis isn’t alive.
I always love when people say “this guy is the consensus #1 next year so teams are gonna tank for him” and then that player ends up not living up to that status before the draft and doesn’t go #1. It happens most years.
His son’s haircut finally killed him
Thank you for enlightening me
PF Changs sends there regards.
He's my number one, but it isnt set in stone that a defensive player or an offensive tackle or other QBs dont also play well  Like there's a legitimate argument for Drake Maye
