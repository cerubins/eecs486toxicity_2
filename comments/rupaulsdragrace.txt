yes
Rusponsibilty\* she stoned.. :D
When did she sneeze? I need to hear this now
Best one yet!!! Get that on a t-shirt 4 me stat! Looovvveee
If they’ve posted one, it’ll be on their twitter/insta. Personally, I’ve had more luck following venues instead. I know Loosey, Malaysia, and Salina will be in SF/Oakland later this month but Sasha’s not coming here until June.
I think Sasha has a show today tmr in LA. I just wonder what she will be doing and where she will be right after her crowning. Thanks for the info!
The fact that all these pictures are homophonic is sending me lmao looks like a lot of fun tho!
Why does Aquaria look like Pythia on the 1st pic likeee 😭
Aquaria looks like Acid Betty omg
Lmao gurl you're like a decade late! but it's still cute though. Yea at the time people were saying it was unfair for Raja to be on a show w/ other queens that weren't as established since she was already considered a veteran working in fashion, t.v and drag.

I'm not seeing it.
You need to get your eyes checked
No she doesn’t
It’s just the brows
Heidi's 💀
Yvies has me confused and then I saw her name and thought “nope that checks out”
![gif](giphy|26BRJpb4yopR9OcSs|downsized)
Yeah as a Sasha Colby fanatic I thought this was hilarious. Princess Poppy might be the comedy queen of season 15 for me
I unironically need more poppy in my life
She was amazing in season 1. Made it to top 3
real camp
I love her sm I hate that she wants to fade away 😭
She’s on fire today
too bad she doesn’t want to be in ours 😔
Is she really quitting drag? Or is it just a goof?
this is what she had to say in an interview: https://ew.com/tv/rupauls-drag-race-princess-poppy-interview-stepping-back-from-drag/
She specifically says she’s not quitting drag
Did y'all understand every reference!? It's so catchy - I've already listened to it on repeat so many times.
Girl and Shea still hasn’t put “Brand New” on streaming platforms
... other than Shea Coulee, did we ever find out who *was* after Peppermint?
I love you sm for this thank you 🙏🏾
This untucked episode was THAT bitch, a cultural reset etc etc.
I heard it was Farrah Moan
[Farrah Moan](https://mobile.twitter.com/farrahrized/status/852225883029069826?lang=en)
Malaysia’s glamorous furry vibes are so fun.
Her entire look was such a shoot. From the tip of her hair ears to her toes
I love the teeny tiny heart on her nose. It's very kawaii. I live!
okay but malaysia has one of my fave aesthetics / brands ever imo  the fox ears for most of the runways, also that MUG
whoever does these wigs for her is about to be so booked by the fursuiters, it's nuts.
We really need HOEtaku Realness runway.
Idk how she did it but the length and cut along with the hair ears was all so flattering and charming. Loved it.
Her face and wig was just eye candy to look at the whole episode. I love her and her looks so much. So vibrant and beautiful
i adore her fox ears
Absolutely stunning, her entrance look was my favorite of the season too! She’s so pretty
![gif](giphy|26BRJKtSmpQU0s0CI|downsized)  ^(this) is who i got :’)
Honestly, she looked very good on the finale, all of them did, but to me, it showed she probably did not have enough time to do her makeup for most of the runways.
Malaysia has THEE best wigs ive been looking forward to see her wig every single episode my god
I love her drag style! Full of joy and glamour.
Fox 🦊
side note, i noticed over halfway through the reunion that amethyst had a raccoon on her lap and i went 'what in furry hell is happening in that corner of the room'
*THIS* is the gay agenda  ![gif](giphy|4vUOpy8hx5OiKsvSD4)
I have no idea how it's so perfect yet so tiny, but I was looking at it every time the camera went to her. I wish they just kept the camera on her the whole episode.
Omg! That heart is so tiny!
Can you imagine a season full of shade from Mistress AND Irene combined? The world simply could not cope
Unfortunately she didn't showcase comedy in her chosen comedy talent show, so...
That elimination was so rough and unfortunate. She clearly had a ton of polish. But maybe should have worked that reformat out a bit longer. Eesh
I've said it before but Irene, of all the first eliminations of RPDR (at least during the time they filmed) is one of the (arguably *very*) few that didn't feel like "sis just wasn't ready for primetime".   If anything I'd say she went in a little too confident. Every queen should be, and it's what Ru likes (many is the queen Ru's shown the door as soon as she says she likes playing it safe or comes across timid and unsure), but Irene seemed to believe she had it more in the bag than she did, kind of kicking her feet up and thinking "I've got this, no need to break a sweat just yet" resulting in a talent show, runway, and lip sync that all read "I just assumed you'd let me slide through this first week."   In short, I don't feel she wasn't ready so much as she just made some very fatal missteps right out of the gate. I won't say I disagree with how things shook out, but there was definitely a sense of "wish I could have seen what she'd have given in *insert challenge here*".
It was her fault tho. She chose that talent to showcase. So if you’re gonna be mad then be mad at her.
I really want to see her on the runway in a future season I love her drag aesthetic.
would HAVE :)
The reunion felt like none of the girls were into her. It was weird. Every time she said something I thought was funny it would cut to awkward stares from the cast
I was on the fence on whether or not I thought they’d bring her back. She didn’t have the CUNT that Shangela did, and she didn’t set social media on fire the way Vanjie did as first outs, so I wasn’t sure what her chances were.  But after seeing how often Ru cut to her (and how well she did when she was called upon), I’ve no doubt she’ll be on All Stars someday.  The reunion was basically “The Mistress and Irene Comedy Show,” and strangely I wasn’t mad at it.
She didn't just go home first, she's also a bitch
She would’ve brought more drama to the season. Love her or hate her she’s good for TV.
She gets a lot of air time more than others in the reunion.
Irene / Season 16 🙏
![gif](giphy|KDbi6mOb2O73HHs0xg|downsized)
![gif](giphy|z7SQTGhPfXtLblEs0K)  Ohmygod
She scored 1/2 on her reads at the reunion, and one was so bad it could honestly have been a -1 instead of a 0.
Tom and Lorenzo said it best (about another queen, but it applies to Irene): "She did the one thing Ru always warns the queens not to do; she f*cked it up."
Salina especially. She seemed upset after the joke about the fake accent. Which is legitimate. I wouldn't make that joke unless I was really close with the person.
I mean, the editors can cut whatever reactions they want whenever they want. They definitely wanted to portray Irene as shady and speaking up a lot and reactions like that can fill that narrative.
Honestly, I do think she would be back for a regular season and not all stars though
Even the people in the shot with hers reactions and the type of laughter she was getting if any felt weird. Even a lot of the responses she was getting felt like the other queens weren’t feeling her.
does this also technically make her your favorite drag queen’s favorite drag queen’s favorite drag queen?
And people still think the other girls have a chance 😮‍💨  ![gif](giphy|zfhavrMEL7ViY5XXHC|downsized)
I usually want to go against the grain and not like the hyped person, thing, and place that everyone else does. However, I fell head over heels in love with Sasha. Gawd, when she performs it’s electric. Sasha knew exactly how to style herself and how to dance and act in the blame it on the edit and it was mesmerizing. She literally took me on a 90s fantasy. There has never been a queen that’s taken my breath away that sasha does. The only options are to queen sasha, or queen sasha.
No shade to anyone else, but it’s mother’s crown and no one else’s
Oh she’s gettin this
Yea after this aired, my friends and I all turned to each other and said “yea, she’s winning” lol
It’s what Sasha deserves!
Bring home the crown mother and shut the haters down!
Stop this making me emotional, she’s so incredible 😭
Sasha is the best case of a ringer that proved herself since Bianca. She damn well knew that her name was in the mouths of Drag Race alum and basically any studied bitch of this craft. HOWEVER, she challenged herself and tore this motherfucker up. That much is what culminated in RuPaul them-damn-selves to be amazed by her.
They need to give it to Sasha so Anetra can return for All Stars. With Aja. 💅🍿
This was shown during reunion I’m guessing?
I fucking love Anetra to death but Sasha deserves the crown
Why didn't they keep this in??
We know, bitch, we’re amazed too.
Best moment of the reunion.
Feels forced they say. That’s an opinion. Did her aired well done mama sound forced too? Maybe production is trying not to lay it on tooo thick that Sasha is going to take this.  All the queens have been fighting for 2nd place all season long.
I was truly gagged by Sasha’s movements, a master class indeed.  This is exactly how she earned her status in the drag community, seeing her perform is truly a blessing.
Idk, why they didn't put that in the actual episode?? It feels forced to me (although Sasha deserves everything)
Feels so forced lol
WELLL DONE MAWMA!! 🫵👁️👁️
Ru really did just cast her to have her own Sasha Colby meet and greet
Idk but spice is your 2nd favorite drag queens 4th least favorite drag queen!
This is waaaay too much math for me
Whose favourite drag queen is RuPaul?
It was the Sasha Colby meet and greet from day one but she also earned the fuck out of it. She legit could have been the first 5x regular drag race winner.
Yeah people are so delusional every time they get angry when someone mentions Sasha is winning or whatever when the production was not even subtle about the narrative they were trying to make. This season was Sasha's journey to the crown, it was never a competition. I'm just happy to witness iconic lipsync performances this season lol
No. Spice
I just don’t understand how sasha could have haters.
I literally shed a tear when I saw that, not gonna lie.
Omg they would be WILD to do this omfg they SHOULD 😂
i want an anetra x aja Lipsync NOW
yes at the end
Probably to not sway the social media “voting”
Agreed. Happy I sat through it so I got to see this moment
The whole “I was 2nd place” debacle actually makes a lot of fucking sense when you’re competing with Sasha Colby.
That actually explains A LOT of the arguments on the season, if the girls had already accepted they were going to lose
I think it would’ve been *too* much of an endorsement of Sasha to put in an episode that ended up being about how incredible all four of them are honesty. They like to keep it more even in that episode
i feel like it’s actually quite the opposite. ru comes across veryyy rehearsed most of the time but most of the unseen footage tonight seemed a lot more genuine
how is it forced?
You try emoting after getting all that botox
This comment feels so forced.
*One day in the late mid 80's I was in my early late 20's…*
A lot of drag queens because RuPaul essentially brought drag to the mainstream and made it a viable (and lucrative) art form for many
She could’ve won: - the musical - the house of Matthew’s visage etc design challenge - granny girl groups  - makeover   And it would’ve been correct.
Does she have the best track record in the herstory of the regular seasons? 4 wins, 4 highs, 0 bottoms, only 1 low
she could've had like.. 7 wins fairly (including the ones she actually got). 8 if they RLY pushed it (the design, which luxx ate the fuck out of)  now that's saying something ![img](emote|t5_2t3or|4812)
They did try to manufacture an opponent out of Anetra and LOTS of people are buying it
I love spice tho
its usually Anetra fans, they really want her to win
The underdog stans always turn in the queen doing the best because it’s “boring”  Why else would Crystal, Willow, Yvie, Sasha Velour, Kim and Pearl been the overwhelming fan favorites
Has Aja said anything since last week's episode where Anetra explained herself regarding ball culture and voguing/waacking?
I've been saying that from the beginning. They were fighting over 2nd because they knew 1st was already taken.
also last season cemented that second place *matters*, if they're all assuming there's a cash prize for it this season as well. third is the new first loser.
![gif](giphy|jqHwM7oSAOViBXt82J|downsized)
Exactly, but this isn’t a pure competition, and from a production standpoint they never would have wanted this to feel like a cakewalk. It will be nice to have the queen with the best track record win for the first time since S10 though
Luxx bodied that design challenge. Sasha could've gotten the head crack challenge, Rumix, girl group, interview, and she lowkey was the lipsync smackdown winner.
Nah, I don't agree with the makeover or rusical. And if we're fixing everything then it would be balanced out with no longer winning the ball.
I believe Sasha has the 4th best track record of all time (regular seasons), which is saying something
I think Bianca still holds the record but she’s up there.
Anetra has been doing drag since 2019. She is absolutely amazing and I love her, but she is not seasoned and refined on Sasha’s level (yet)
i hope she did because anetra keeps ignoring her and aja looks even more like boo boo the fool
Just because she *could’ve* won the challenge doesn’t always mean she *should’ve*  Production could’ve easily edited her into winning eight different challenges if she wanted to because she gave a win worthy performance
S15 is an enormous season, she didn’t only have a lot of chances to win challenges, moreso she had a ton of chances to fail and to be in the bottom. To only have one low placement in these many episodes is simply astounding. Sasha’s track record is absolutely the one that gags me the most
I know they said "could've", I was talking more about them saying "and it would've been correct". But yeah, I agree that if they wanted to they definitely could've lol.
First golden boot to not be a design challenge
LaLa really is in a league of her own, though. The doors she opened.
I think Jax's tie dye look was worse, but I'm fine with this because that means we get to see Salina again at the next reunion.
It's not just that Salina's was bad - it's the absolute absence of taste that sets it apart from other bad looks this season. Even with some of the crappier looks you can at least discern a slight sense of taste or style, but not a single good decision was made with this  I'm not trying to be mean about Salina or anything like I really like her, but this is real bad and if it wasn't this it should have been her money look
Salina’s has grown on me
Category is, color blocking
I love the lamppost look and I will die on this hill.
The signs are the funniest part of this look. Street signs have a very iconic style with the rounded white border. Having that element missing from all the signs makes it look like she’s just wearing words.
At least Selina had a concept though Jax was dressed as a mucus puddle
Icons only
I will not tolerate any slander of Salina’s look! I love it so much — unironically.
the way anetra should've gotten this award imo (love her tho !!) like i actually liked salina's look.. honestly my 3 nominations would've been anetra's sugar ball / tie dye, salina's money ball & jax's beautiful nightmare
Anetra’s tie dye or candy ball look could’ve also won
The holy trinity
It feels right ❤️
I think Salina’s money look should’ve been it
Crackers Hairkini 👁️👄👁️
Salina absolutely didn’t deserve this when the actual worst look of the season, Anetra’s tie dye look, didn’t even get a nomination  At least the street lamp is like iconic bad and not just bad bad I guess though
Salinas look is a toot and no I will not be taking questions at this time
Did Salina make that lamp look herself?
The way Marcia's tie-dye should have won it
I will NEVER get over Salina’s entrance look. I really couldn’t root for her because it’s all I could think about.
What even is the point of this award? It just makes the girls feel worse and they already suffer enough. Salina's lamp post is not anazing but definitely not the worse out of the entire season. Such an unnecessary segment.
Justice for Selina’s palm tree look
And the fashion photo girlies tooted this lmao
did raja and raven toot it too LOL
I hate this look but I still think Anetra’s tie dye look was worse. Even if only slightly.
The Unholy Trinity the Tuck Mattellabella Fifi O'hara Morphosister Mistress Madame Rupaul
The doors salina have opened and lamps she has turned on.
The fact that she paid for it, mawma
The bags she has glued.
Jax’s look has haunted me since the day it aired.
Tbh I see the arguments for both looks, but I think the reason this look was chosen is because it's more infamous. The Golden Boots have been outfits that weren't just bad, but *iconically* bad.
I didn’t like her beautiful nightmare look more. It looks like some low budget horror film character.
I genuinely don't understand why it's so hated. The orange and green slime was giving me Nickelodeon in a fun way. The hair was cute, idk I found it to be a safe look.
i wonder if the reason why jax wasn't chosen is bc there were a lot of sus outfits on that runway. we don't know exactly what prompt they're told, so if it was something that was easy to misinterpret the show might be more lenient on bad interpretations.  though yeah the look was bad overall.
i actually liked jax's look 🫣 but yeah i agree with the last part
Idk Jax tie-dye look was awful to me. At least this had a concept idk what Jax was thinking tbh
The wig. The signs. The shape of lamp. The body suit. The colours. Nothing worked. But i will remember this look for the rest of my life.
It has glowed on me.
And taste blocking.
You saw those signs and they opened up your eyes.
I wanted it to be styled differently (i hate the wig honestly) but i loved the concept and i don’t think it’s *that* bad. I think her palm tree look is worse and so are a few looks from other queens.
Very few streets have rounded edges in my city jsyk
The fashion triad
You mean the legendary food stamp palm tree.
Can we travel back in time and give her the award.
Jax's tie dye look is right there
It looked like she did lol.
She made the bodysuit, the signs were by a fabricator.
The fucking bucket hat, Mary
Wait do you mean Jax or Salina? Cause Salina's... Even the wig... I just don't have anything nice to say. I think Jax's was better by comparison.

The only true “Villain” this show has ever really had is Raven on S2   Every other season it’s been the fans
the real villain of season 4 is the one i won’t name but you all know who.
S15 is MistLuxEy LaDucaBelleNoir (none of them were the villain but they WERE the drama)
"5 minutes, Queens!" PA
Season 5 - this will be a controversial take but Coco Montrese. Most would say Roxxxy but her villainy really only took off in the last few eps. Coco also got away with a lot because one of her biggest targets was Alyssa, who gave as good as she got. But Coco is needlessly awful constantly, especially to Jinkx.
There are the one-note villains like The Vixen, Acid Betty or Brita that we really got nothing to see from the except the times they were "mean", so you know more like an edit villain. Then there are the storyline villains like Roxxxy, Phi Phi or Silky that were put against a "hero" that had to prove themselves or something, and now there's Branding Villains that know their "evilness" creates great TV like Kandy or Daya. Of course there are isolated cases  1: Rebecca Glasscock / 2: Tyra Sanchez / 3: Mimi Imfurst / 4: Phi Phi O'Hara / 5: Roxxxy Andrews / 6: Darienne Lake / 7: Ginger Minj / 8: Acid Betty / 9: Aja / 10: The Vixen / 11: Silky Nutmeg Ganache / 12: Brita / 13: Kandy Muse / 14: Daya Betty / 15: Irene Dubois

don't u mean always![img](emote|t5_2t3or|4821)
Yo, true though!
Roxxxy on season 5 wants a word
> 15: Irene Dubois  Icon. Eliminated first and the villain of the season from afar.
Sasha seemed like she wished the reunion was only 1 hour lol
My husband watches drag race with me now and he can’t stop saying shit like, “I’m serving bedtime realness. I’m in my sleepy era.”   Thanks s15
That’s the Robin Fierce screen time I was looking for! The Best Buy drag? Rhonda? Government name drops? Oh she’s taking Connecticut vs the World.
honestly all of it was a blur except anetra holding amethyst’s baby hostage
Ru quickly brought up Anetra’s merch, MIB as a sitcom, and touted the Sasha music video. Capitalism Ru moves like lightning
Did Jax say a single word?
Sasha wore those blue contacts thinking it would hide how stoned she was 😂
Come through Connecticut! That was pretty cool.   Not surprised that poor Loosey had a bad experience growing up in the lower Naugatuck Valley. Like a lot of states, the bigger cities are very diverse and inclusive, while many smaller towns are...not. Still, as a whole Connecticut is very LGBTQ+ friendly, and I'm proud of Governor Ned Lamont, Lt. Governor Susan Bysiewicz, and our state legislators for being proactive in ensuring LGBTQ+ and women's rights are protected as others seek to destroy them.
The Marciax3 opening line was hilarious.   "Come for me? And I will apologize immediately." Lmao. So relatable queen.
Spice just be saying things
I feel like the girls don’t like Irene at all 💀
I was not expecting the tribute. Ugh now I'm crying
wow Sasha and Anetra managed to stay out of the drama the entire 2hrs reunion lol. The fiercest 2 are also the quietest 2.
“I’m the motherfucking queen of drag! I’m amazed by you!” OH MOTHER IS TAKING IT
honestly i wish anetra had done baby hands for snatch game. there is so much she could've done and i know she was safe for gordina(?) ramsey but baby hands had sooooo much potential 😭😭😭
I was watching the most recent Very Delta with Coco Puru the other day and she just mentions off hand how she always does some random thing with Heklina, or sends Heklina certain things, when she wasn’t even a part of the convo and this was filmed before she passed. It’s really really apparent how huge a figure Heklina was in the drag community when the Coco Puru’s are name dropping you in an interview. So freaking sad.
Mistress was really funny but I would have liked to hear from the other girls more considering MTV cut the episodes down so much we barely knew them. I know the others probably weren’t giving as much but it was 90 mins….     Oh and STAN PRINCESS POPPY GLASSCOCK
Am I the only one that enjoyed the reunion? Lol
🧿👄🧿
Ok so my thoughts:  1.) Sasha is 10000% taking the crown next week. I just hope Anetra is second place.  2.) I adore the twins so much, I want them back on the show, possibly separately lol  3.) I love Loosey and I’m v happy she said what’s on her mind even tho she clearly still lets Luxx and Mistress get under her skin about what happened  4.) While I love all the queens, by no means are they obligated to be “family” and I’m glad they don’t seem to be fake when it comes to pretending like they love each other. Luxx and Loosey can respect each other but not fuck with each other either and that’s okay.
Is this the first time they skipped asking all the queens who they think should win in the reunion?
Did Jax even get a single word in
Also wow Irene's outfit was sooooo cool
Special shout out to Rupaul trying to goad Anetra into commenting on the whole opinions-about-vogue-online thing and Anetra looking her dead in the eye like "nope 💜"
"I'm the motherfucking queen of drag! I am amazed by you!"
Selina's only screen time was getting the Boot Award ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|cry)
From retail to Yale...this won't be the last we hear of Robin Fierce
The Jax erasure. I mean dang she had a strong talent show and good lip syncs...
people on twitter are already whining about “vogue-ish” lmao
I was super uncomfortable with the whole Aura-Poppy crush outing by Ru, followed immediately by sharing the news of Aura’s engagement. Yikes.
Im litterally so confused... what episode was Rebecca Glasscock eliminated?
**SEVEN INCHES MAYARI** congrats on getting married gorl
 I may have been first out…. But I’m also a BItch
They were being generous with the golden boot nominations. Marcia's tie dye look? If anything it should have been the dentist look or the bra and diaper. Anetra's candy ball and/or tie dye look could have made an appearance. I know people hated Poppy's metallic look. I personally did not care for Amethyst's pigtails and bows look. Salina could have had a few nominations tbh. The Leatherface look, the money ball look, etc. Those were some tame picks they had.
I am so into vogueish righ now!
Poppy makes me laugh. The whole time she’s been so flippant about being on Drag Race 🤣 Everyone’s so glamazon and she’s out here in Rebecca/ Nicole drag saying she quits 🤣🤣🤣 Hilarious
I think Rupaul had a lot of fun with this cast. I don’t think I’ve ever seen her so animated and excited
The ending of the unseen footage of Sasha was so impressive that it made me feel emotional, her movements were really a piece of art omg.  And the ending tribute to all the gone too soon legends had me misty-eyed, rest in perfection.
I’m surprised Salina had such little screen time
Loved how Sugar & Spice's looks referenced the Lizzie Maguire Movie concert with Lizzie & Isabella.
That comment from Ru to Sasha!
Was Salina in the reunion at all? Is this production’s response to her putdown of Ross?
Marcia just walking in there with the best opening line was not what I had on the cards but I'm down
Why was Amethyst a raccoon?
Jax looked so... happy... during her governments' message
Season 9 still takes the crown for best reunion
Irene Dubois literally came in and said "Ru, sending me home was a mistake."
That was a very un-dramatic Reunion which I'm fine with honestly. At least it wasn't TRAUMATIC like Season 10's, I'm always worried about that lol
The captioning on this franchise is the ultimate villain.
Selina and Irene tea 👀
Princess poppy was… there.
My favourite moment all night was Selina lip synching perfectly to a clip of Anetra’s talent performance.
I hope Salina is okay... She just [tweeted this](https://i.imgur.com/sz29oZo.png) She doesn't sound like she's very happy with the reunion.
Why did salina have less airtime????
I’m a dummy like Spice, what was the line Lux said before they threw to commercial?
And why did they let Aura say she's getting married and then immediately cut to break? Who is she getting married to? Was she joking or being serious? I don't understand what was happening, she didn't get to elaborate at all. And then that after they set up her and Poppy? I am confusion.
Selina's in her feels tonight. She was PISSED at the girls when they talked about her
Other than the top four sitting together, was there any logic to the seating arrangements? It seemed odd that Irene was in the front right by Ru
So Miss Congeniality announcement will come next week?
So you’re telling me that Anetra was gonna go full rpdr_nolimbs on that baby 💀
i just wish i could tell loosey how much a lot of us genuinely love her
Havent seen the episode as of yet (br) but the unseen extra footage sounds bittersweet to me.  Sweet because FINALLY EXTRA FOOTAGE but bitter because no Season 15 Ru’s Cut
I need a ss of Miss Roople when the Loosey/Mistress/Irene filler discussion was happening - she LOVES mess and I love it
Was Marcia x3's makeup line real or a joke?
what did someone say to salina during that reading challenge that made her mad ☠️☠️ i just heard “ok white girl 🙄”
The reunion was ....fine.  🤷
This reunion really was the MIB meet and greet. At least we got to hear some unaired reads that should've been included to begin with.
Need Irene on All-Stars expeditiously
Malaysia looked so good tonight 🥺🥺
We’re gonna get an Anetra and Sasha lip sync for the crown and I already can’t handle it
Welp I left that reunion feeling very bad for Loosey and Salina
It’s interesting- I didn’t go into this season really looking forward to Loosey but she’s really grown on me and this reunion really solidified it.  Also everyone keeps going on about how this was the MIB show- but no one is acknowledging the fact that Irene also dominated in a way no other first-out has. Ru seemed really tickled by her, too, so my hopes are high she gets to come back for All Stars. Because let’s be real: she was robbed and so were we. She would have been such damn good tv.
Malaysia is top toot this week for me 💖
I'm sorry but did rupaul hold the girls at gunpoint while they gave those introduction lines? They feel so forced omg at least princess poppy finally said something memorable tho lmao
That reunion was not as much fun as I expected it to be.
Princess Poppy's reads made me laugh so hard I woke my boyfriend up lol
I love how Poppy has like, 3 lines in the entire episode 💀
Poppy showing up in that season 3 wig is a gag tbh
Sasha's contact lenses were a choice
Sasha is a goddess among us but the intense blue contacts.... Mother NOOO 😭. I thought we left those behind with Trixies old makeup.
So Sasha is the winner, right?
MIB led the reunion for sure, and I'm glad the likes of Robin and Irene got some screen time. I'm a bit surprised at how little Anetra and Sasha were featured, though.  I wish the queens would just leave Loosey alone. If they don't care for her or her art that's fine, but it seems like they keep poking at her.
S14 may have been very sugary and sweet but even THAT season had a much spicier reunion..   For a season with so much drama and pettiness, this reunion was S T A L E. if Irene and Mistress weren’t there, this would’ve been unbearable..
"Can you put me in touch with the person who retouched this photo?" DAMN
I love Salina so much. I wish her makeup tonight was better. The contouring of the jaw and the darkness of the neck was so opposite.
Kinda disappointed that Sasha re-wore her lalaparuza look lol also the blue contacts were a choice
I needed way more Jax
I'm just here to say Luxx looked bomb + Poppy is fcking hiilarious, love a deadpan troll
Why did Salina not like it when Irene read her? Do they have beef?
Anetra and Sasha seemed to be reasonably annoyed by the whole ordeal while Mistress and Luxx were happy to cut up again
Salina seemed to say that “yt girl” line with contempt. Nobody laughed. Felt weird.
I loved and/or laughed at every Anetra intervention.
Damn are all of the winners being quiet during the reunion going to be a trend except for Yvie ofcourse
“Thank you for that” is Robin’s legacy on this television program
This episode is also known as "Mistress Reunited (ft. Others)".
I love Mistress, i just wished that she owned the fact that she does like to push the girls sometimes.
I’m surprised they didn’t talk about the fact that Jax werked her ass off during the lalaparooza lip sync. She deserves her flowers.
So Sasha clearly won the season.   Looking forward to the finale!
I love MIB but her getting extremely defensive & started reading everyone, when everyone was simply just saying Jax won the lip sync was a little much. But hey I do love me some good ass reality tv lmao and it did tickle me.
Did Anetra get her All Stars lips done early?  Or just paint differently tonight?  She looks amazing regardless, as always!
When was the reunion filmed? Before or after the finale?
Did they not go through who each queen's winner is? Did I miss it?
Of all Irene's unused looks I'm surprised they showed off that one when there were better options. Just give us more Irene, biggest let down of the season that she went home first.
Selena needed to put some makeup on her neck.   Yessh
I enjoyed the reunion and felt like all the girls got screentime lol  Sasha and Anetra were this quiet during the actual season, why would they all of a sudden start talking more cuz it’s the reunion? 🥴  MIB in her politician era lol she was deflecting some of those questions and had a response for everything! Great television lol
The way this season has been Mistress’s Drag Race 😂
This reunion is really entertaining 😁 thanks girlies
sasha... damn girl we see em
This was the mistress show. She was the only one ready to cut up and gather the girls. No one else for any or no reason had any opinions on anything, they were all aiming for miss congeniality, the mom Videos had more spark than most of these girls. The only part that was funny was how badly Loosey wanted to let loose and how her eyes looked ready to murder someone but she kept giving media training responses.
what a long two hours
Bro who tf is Princess Poppy? I don’t remember her AT ALL 🥴
Salina was so bothered by Irene’s read lmao
 was waiting for all that heat that people said was coming. Where were the fights people promised us?!?! Was it just MIB lying? Also say what you want about her, but Mistress was giving me everything tonight. Peak entertainment!
No shade, but why was Sasha wearing the same look from the lip synch lalaparuza? Also wish she wore a softer blue contact lens.
She finally got her second win --  Mistress Isabelle "Reunion Winner" Brooks 🫶  ![gif](giphy|RnoRQDcJXBQTvg99ig)
Well at least it wasn't season 13's reunion
Was the reunion worth watching? I watched the first 20-30 mins of it and it was giving cutesy meet up versus a reunion where we get to the bottom of things and I was not living personally!
My fav moments were M3’s tagline and kinda zoning out during one of the MIB monologues and watching Amethyst pet her raccoon behind her.
Like, I know production cuts out a lot to fit into a 40-60 minute episode, but they really have a **ton** of good footage that's left unseen.  They could make bank by doing what they do with UNHhhh and give WoW exclusive content/clips.
The first 15 times Mistress said that she was in her "______ era", I may have hee hee'd and ha ha'd.... but when she said "chaotic era", why was that the funniest fucking shit to me??? I laughed so hard I started seeing stars! She was definitely the highlight of the reunion.  The best part tho was the unseen footage with Sasha and Ru telling her "I'M THE MUTHAFUCKING QUEEN OF DRAG!! I'M AMAZED BY YOU!!" Winner winner, chicken dinner
This was the meh before the storm
MIB is a troll and I love that. But maybe she should make it clear that she was only trolling/joking, cause all the things she said about others she doesn't have receipt to back up and it doesn't look good tbh
Episode 15, The Mistress Special
Well that was a reunion that happened.
I know Mistress isn't everyone's taste, but if the producers are choosing to show her for a majority of a 2 hour reunion with a 16 queen cast, then I think that's on the producers, not Mistress. They are all there to create a show--Mistress included--so if she's one of the handful of girls trying to create something entertaining, I'm not mad that she was the focal point.  Sasha and Anetra are still my pick for the eventual top 2 (although who knows since it sounds like they are NOT doing a smackdown for the crown judging by Ru's preview at the end of the episode), but I wish they would've been more vocal. Mistress is one of my favorite RPDR girls of all time, and this season wouldn't have been anywhere near as entertaining without her.
Wish we got more Irene this season. We missed out.
Mistress ate Loosey up, Sasha got praised in a daze, Salina was unhappy, Irene had her moment, Poppy had the best reference, Lux stayed true to herself, Robin disappeared, Jax finally wore something nice, Anetra remains loved, Amethyst/Marcia/twins just seems happy, and Malaysia is stunning
Mistress is made for tv I really hope we see more of her but THAT PHONE CALL TO IRENE THO WE NEED TO KNOW 😩
Condragulations Mistress Isabelle Brookes, you are the winner of this week’s reunion
Yes Mistress is messy af but do we come to drag race to watch well-mannered and emotionally mature people come together to hold hands and sing Kumbaya?
Why has Amazon been so late this season?
did irene and mistress have a falling out?
I love Malaysia's pink makeup
Why is the reopening of the library during the reunions always so fucking awkward
What the fuck is Salina’s hair
Miss major intestinal blockage won the reunion for me 😂 also I loved poppy and THEE robin fierce getting screen times.. surprised that miss estitties was kinda in the background tho lol
The desperation to make people see Luxx & Mistress as “nicer” was so apparent. I get that there are trolls, but we wanted the truth. I wanted to see that wig measured. I wanted the dirt, not the “you were just misunderstood” show.
What a great day to be a Mistress stan ☺️❤️
Loosey was my favorite this reunion episode
Sasha seemed uncomfortable and just off...wondering if we are missing something.
Sugar and Spice were fun to have on the season! I loved their reunion looks too
If the reunion was a challenge Mistress won it.
I can’t say this reunion was bad but I do want those 2 hours of my life back
The look on Luxx's face when Loosey called Luxx out for wearing that wig that Mistress used in the night of a 1000 Beyonce runway.  It was deserved.  Loosey should have also called Luxx out for her makeover look.  I don't hate Luxx, but she is someone who dishes it out, but can't take it.
Honestly, for the first time ever, I would not be mad if this season is a tie. Both Anetra and Sasha are absolutely deserving of this season’s crown.
Loved Aura in this reunion, sad we didn’t get to see more of her bc of the short runtime
My god Mistress shined the most out of this reunion like if she doesn’t win this season she’s winning whatever future all stars season she does
Mistress was hella entertaining. But the way she straight up said she's a liar earlier in the reunion,, then said she absolutely doesn't lie when Irene brought up what MIB told her Loosey said...girl what's the story. She deflects soooo hard when she gets caught.   The way she also constantly referred to drag as "her career" and "what she does" felt unintentionally (or not) condescending toward everyone else, as though she's the only serious and authentic drag queen because she's a Texas pageant girl.
What time does the episode typically get uploaded to MTV.com, y’all? This information is surprisingly difficult to find
I feel like this reunion was Irene's screen test for All Stars.  I was really surprised how many times Ru kept going back to her and they knew what they were doing seating her right there next to Ru!  She's entertaining as hell
Well that was lame tbh
What was the "pretty kisses America" that Luxx said from?
Luxx's hair is sooo cute I love it
This reunion would have been boring without Mistress just like the whole season. Haters love to deny it. 💅
Irene’s read of Salina fully gagged me
mistress gathered and we stan
I feel like Irene’s comment about Salina’s accent was a touch far
Im going to get downvoted for this but as a Mexican-American with ties to the Bay Area and Los Angeles, no one from the bay has a accent like Salina. I know she moved to LA when she was 17, but if anything she’s been a little offensive with the strong accent. She was mad she got clocked because that wasn’t shade.
That was 1 hour too long it turned into MIB vlog half way
This was the Mistress Isabelle Brook’s Drag Race Reunited and I honestly was living the whole time 😂 if this was a challenge, Mistress would’ve gotten her second win because this whole reunion was basically about her and also hosted by her
So at the end of the day, Mistress is really the phony one. 😱 That lie she made up about Loosey calling Irene’s face saggy is so bizarre. She just likes to fuck with people. I’m not a Loosey fan, but even when she’s been shady, she was never that malicious.
Lets go down the list     Irene: I really don't understand the hype. Sure she has good looks but other then that She's Joslyn fox to Mistress's Courtney.  Poppy: Amazing look  Sugar/Spice: It's them what else is there to say  Amethyst: Was There  Robin Fierce: Again same with Irene, I see people hype her up all the time and maybe in real life she gives but in the show I don't remember her really at all.  Aura Mayari: Was there, a little more then Amethyst  Jax: one of the best looks she had  Malaysia: Looked like she was just having a good time honestly  Marcia X3: Great look, and had the best like entrance line  Salina: I know she has been going though it in the past few months but I think she needs a thicker skin. Loosey had no reason to apologize for choosing her back then to go home. At that point Salina was the worst contestant. And the fact she got that pressed over Irene calling out her fake accent. Like girl....  Loosey: felt very in her "It is what it is" era   Mistress: I love her and I think she can do the shade and jabby comments better then anyone but it's starting to feel like she needs to shove herself into every situation and make a comment on everything.  Luxx: I think this really showed the best and the worst of Luxx. Luxx really has that special something and could win any season hands down. I think what holds her back is that her confidence is very "Im going to brag" and can turn people off. Sure it's alright to be proud and all that but I think she still needs to find that sweet spot.  Anetra: Was pretty quite the whole time but seemed like she was just enjoying the show. I wish she would of said more about the voguing stuff since everyone on the other side of that conversation can't keep their mouths shut on it.  Sasha: When the season first started it took me a while to connect with anyone but from the start I was like "I guess Sasha should win because everyone says she should. and now Im fully 100% behind that statement. She is what the winner of drag race should be. Not to discredit anyone else but there is a reason there was so much hype around Sasha. At the end of the day Sasha should of been on years ago and would of won hands down. But because of how Drag Race viewed Trans back then that never happened.
CAN WE TALK ABOYT MISTRESS CALLING OUT LOOSEY FOR BEING FAKE. I DIED. Also loosey should have won the makeover.
God, this episode really is the Mistress meet and greet,  isn't it?  ![gif](giphy|W3yN23DGXxE8mD4tt7)
Love Luxx Loosey & Mistress for serving us good tv
One thing you do NOT do is try mistress. Cuz she will SHUT. YOU. UP. I lovedddd her speaking up and telling the tea  . . . . . .  (unless you're bobbianna)
Irene 🤨
They really shoved Mistress down our throats, sometimes less is more, towards the end of the reunion I found myself hoping to get more of the other girls’ inputs but nope…..so much Mistress.
Irene carried this, for me. I wish Anetra had had more air time and MIB a lot less, frankly.
Honestly….I think “bully” was the right word to use. And it’s sad that Loosey got bullied into taking it back. Mistress and Luxx were straight up Regina and Gretchen. Sugar and spice are Karen.
I noticed Salina was awfully quiet in the back and finally got the recognition she deserves for her god awful runways. I would have died if she had won with her glove runway! ☠️😂🤪
This is the second week in a row that prime video hasn’t posted the episode when they normally do. Last week it didn’t show up until Sunday morning, and by then the elimination hd already been spoiled. It just sucks because even though I paid for the whole season up front and have sucked it up with the terrrrible video quality, I know that I’m probably going to have to go even further and watch tonight’s episode on YouTube which will inevitably be poorly cropped, have muffled audio, and yellow subtitles lol
I’ll say it. I’m tired of Mistresses salty vibes and shade can we hear from the other girls more please?
I can only imagine the power Mistress will have with a few years of hosting and dealing better with involving those around her in her spotlight.  Don't get me wrong, she's a STAR. But even those need good chemistry with a support cast to keep the dynamics fresh and elevate the whole final product.  But the whole top 5 and Irene were meant for tv.
Anyone else find this “drama” boring? It’s about as unoriginal as some of their drag…  People keep saying it’s “good TV” with all these “fights”. Some of y’all like to cling onto the reality television of 20 years ago. Shades and reads are hilarious, but some of this extra drama, yawn.  These queens are so talented, I would have loved to just see more of what everyone is up to, how they have grown, etc.  Congrats to Aura who is fighting the good fight in Nashville, and great to see CT legislature showing how it’s done. Also Kevin Bacon.
This was the Mistress show; if you love Mistress this will be one of your favourite reunions, and if not....get some taste!
I will say the reunion reminded me again why I fully love Mistress. She is so fucking funny and just such an easy to enjoy personality. I would give her the praise the judges occasionally give where they're like "if I were to walk into a bar and see you at the mic, I'd feel safe and know I was about to have a good time" or however it goes.  I was a bit disappointed in her showing the last few episodes of the season (and honestly from all angles I was so tired of the loosey vs her and lux jush..like literally all angles not pointing a finger at any of the three), BUT this fully reminded me of what she does best. She's a fantastic and hilarious queen and even though I'm rooting for Sasha to win, Mistress is my #2 and I hope she gets to showcase some excellence next week.
I think its funny how in reunion Luxx and Mistress had to explain they aren’t the problem every 5 minutes 💀. Yall two are the common denominator in every incident! Speak ur tea!!   This reunion really shed light on how terrible these two were.
I watched this episode at my friends house. My bf didn’t know it was the reunion, and asked me who won when I got home.  I answered Mistress, obviously.
Mistress is such a TV gold!!!!! She won this reunion!!!!
Loosey's look is so confused
A lot of the comments I’m seeing are talking about how certain people got half the reunion to talk while everyone else got 4 to 5 sentences IF that.  I understand season 15 was a huge milestone and they wanted to bring in a lot of queens to celebrate in a way, but this is what happens when there’s such a large group. I kind of wish they’d go an AS7 route with a main season, where it’s 8-10 contestants, no one is eliminated, and each have a point system, and on the last episode, you add up the points and we have a top 4. Wishful thinking, but some of these queens that have amazing drag were heavily overshadowed by edits and runtimes.
Mistress made this really hard to watch.
Me any time Mistress effortlessly gathered the girls  ![gif](giphy|26AHR023WFqiDRHZ6)  >!Otherwise...not a very eventful reunion!<
I have been watching and it is ENDLESS! Omg
When mistress was talking about how some queens were speaking up over fans coming for them (MIB and Luxx) and some queens weren’t, was she implying Loosey? The camera panned to her after she said it.
Loosey is doing her darndest to appear likable and unbothered
Mistress really owned that reunion lmao also I think Loosey came off even faker in this ep AND the production was trying to sell her, I'm tired
Holy fuck. I was iffy on mistress from the start of the season but after this reunion... woof, girl. That's not it. She literally got called out on TV for lying and claiming Loosey said horrible things. Like that's beyond being "messy" and "dramatic" that's actually incredibly disgusting behavior. Honestly she really showed her hand on this episode and I personally didn't like it.  I don't understand how some of you still support her after that, but to each their own. I really would not be surprised if in a couple of months it comes out that she has done way worse things.
Reading this, I can see I'm good to skip it, because I'm okay skipping an episode of MIB's drag race.
I feel like there needs to be a PSA exclusively for Salina's name. It's Salina EsTitties, no? Aka the equivalent of Saline Tits (maybe...roughly...?) in Spanish.  I can only tolerate so many "Selina"s in the comments babes, though god bless y'all.
It’s so weird to me how a lot of u like to paint Loosey as a helpless victim. During this reunion especially I noticed how y’all were trying to keep up the “she gets attacked for no reason” narrative while loosey would give harsh reads at other drag queens. she is just as shady as luxx and mistress… but..she’s white so therefore she isn’t “aggressive” or a “bully.” She has also been involved in most if not all of the gates… so don’t act like that’s why u all don’t like MIB and luxx. You think it’s okay when loosey is super confident and is adamant that she won a challenge but when MIB or luxx do it they’re “annoyingly cocky”… so many double standards
Wtf is Poppy wearing???
Love how Irene tried really hard to make herself the main character and none of her queens laughed at any of her jokes, Ru chuckled here and there. So glad she was gone the first ep, downvote me away, she’s got zero charm or charisma.
this was lit rally mistress' episode. she really brought so much to this season luv her
Well we got 13 boring flops, MIB, Luxx, and Loosey. At least some girls remember that this is an entertainment show  (This is only about the reunion. Sasha and Anetra are drag goddesses but they were boring flops here)
salina is out here looking like a ping pong ball with contour trying to shade everyone like giiiirrrlllll..... youre an AFTERTHOUGHT lmfao
Irene really fighting her 15 minutes …
Spice should work on her speaking skills
I'm all for free the nipple... but MIBs nipple was so distracting
About halfway through miss thing's indica delta8 gummy kicked in and she was like alright I'm gonna win, how many more questions do we have
I can relate to her 😂
We were eating dinner and watching tonight and when we finished eating I said it was time to enter our dessert era
Girl, your husband is correct, this reunion put us all in our sleepy era.
That is so cute. Anytime I watch drag race my husband says "ohhhh that Trixie" and is so proud he knows... something 🤣
Can you two adopt me, I love this.
Ru was BEAMING at her when she was talking about her time at Yale. 🥰
I enjoyed coked up Spice
Just like Trixie said, Always Be Closing A Sale.
I’m curious what cut she makes off the merch 🧐
Boot.
A juicy question to ask Jax would be what she thought about losing the lipsync to Mistress, especially given the shocked reaction from the girls in the workroom (which Jax wouldn’t have known about until after the show aired). Instead Ru gave Mistress even more air time by asking her how she felt and she offered nothing new!
She was just happy to be invited
*Terrible* idea. My eyes never look bluer than when they’re red af.
Ooh I didn't think of that. She seemed off her game tbh, that would explain it. Every time a question came to her she was just *"Oh! Uh.. well.."* then Ru would answer for her and laugh and she would just go with it.
we stan honestly. imagine how nerve wracking something like doing the reunion is, so many of the girls seemed nervous and i fucking GET it and i would’ve been high af too lol
I peeped that! 🤣
It was sweet to see how genuinely touched Loosely was by their words.
that moment got me. while it obviously sucks to hear about loosey’s experience growing up there, it’s encouraging to hear that things have changed and leaders of the state are supportive of the community.
I thought that was the best opening line.
Lol it literally happened with her and Spice (Sugar?) on Twitter. Spice was pissed about something Marcia said in a confessional then Spice tweeted some hate at her. Marcia replied like "sorry girlie I didn't know you felt that way."   *Maturity? In MY drag queens? More likely than you'd think!*
And Poppy omg "I'm quitting drag. You're welcome." 💀
I wonder if she’s ever had an original thought
I loved it lmao
RuPaul was the only one laughing at her jokes it was painful.
Can’t relate cause I was living for her.
They seemed so disinterested in everything she had to say.
I honestly couldn't tell I really liked seeing more of her! I think she knows what kind of drag she wants to do / is confident and it made the other girls insecure (like sugar and spice).
Wait what did I miss
Them bishes let their talent do the talking, and I live.
Ru has never praised any queen on the show like she praises Sasha.
EXACTLY WHAT I THOUGHT. Plus, why would they air that if they aren’t crowning her next week?!
They probably wouldn’t let her do it for copyright issues or whatever, but I’m dying to see her impression of it.
Heklina was legendary and really took drag in a new direction. It’s because of her that we have challenges like the daytona wind on drag race. If you go on the YT channel for Oasis SF, you’ll find a ton of plays she helped put together and starred in✨🤍
I had the same sort of thought when I watched that interview. Such a loss.
I wish they let Poppy host the episode
I loved it dw
I was entertained!
Spicy or not, I enjoy a drag reunion 🤷‍♀️
I laughed a lot!
I did! It’s no S9 reunion, but I felt more engaged with this one than the past few. I think I just really like this cast.
I personally found it rather boring but am glad to hear some people enjoyed it
This made me cackle
Hi Sasha! I just saw Sasha, girl!
I’ll never see this emoji the same ever again
The girls are still obsessed with second place 😂
I dunno it kinda felt like Sasha got zero airtime compared to the other queens.
They didn't in 14
Because they all said Sasha and no one could even lie to root for the other girls without looking foolish
She booted her look and that was pretty much it
Yes, when she booted her own look 😂
yes. one single word.
Is it me or the whole time she looked.... displeased ?
Straight outta Mortal Kombat
She's that bitch
Ya'll will roast this man for "goading" her if he brings it up at all, or you'll roast him for not bringing up the whole drama at all. I think they both handled their part flawlessly. Address the controversy so that no one can say they avoided it. And then shake it off and move right along. I loved the approach.
And NOT having a joke about a fake accent 😬
She also talked about Anetra's fans bringing her rubber 🐤 at her meet and greets which was cute
And on top of that you spell her name wrong.
this whole time i thought the best buy photos were edited but THEYRE REAL😭😭😭
Ru literally went "Well the first good lipsync was Sasha and Anetra" 💀💀 She said fuck everybody else's drag right off the bat
IKR, they even did a whole segment about the good lip syncs this season and I don't think they even mentioned her then?
They only featured lipsyncs where the two contestants were standouts. Still, they should’ve mentioned her… Her Sweetest Pie lipsync raptured me.
They said “good lipsynch? If we mention that we might have to mention the other crumbs we didn’t give her”
Ugh it just feels like she can’t win because if she says it’s vogue then they say it’s noguing and if she says it’s voguish then it’s disrespectful??? Whatever happened to being inspired by some thing, and combining it with other art forms, ( ex. martial arts and vogue )
Right?? What was with that timing?!
and also, poppy is literally in a relationship. weird moment.
Episode 47 in season 13.
She was in the top 3 so she made it to the last episode but Bebe and Nina lipsynched for the crown.
Anetra's tie dye look should have been the golden boot definitely.
I wonder why Ru didn't directly say Aja's name cause that's clearly what she was getting at when she said some call it noguing
The “you’re welcome” killed me 🤣🤣
Thats the coffee enema talking
And she didn’t seem to enjoy Irene’s library read.
It was so good
Is that what they were doing? I am too old to catch the reference lol
I love that they grew up watching disney channel as much as I did.
all the shots they showed of her was either her getting roasted or her looking sad lmao
She won the challenge! 🥇👢
She probs wasn’t in the mood. Her mom just died so I wouldn’t be that excited to be there if I was her.
Loved Marcia's but I absolutely lost it at Poppy's lol
wait was she ? how didn't i notice💀
I thought she was wearing a trash bag and the racoon aws an accessory.
she was holding one, i didn’t get raccoon out the look tho. i loveddd that grey velvet tho, it’s one of my favorite colors.
![gif](giphy|WMde39zkaZPLE8Srt5)
What happened in S10?? Idr shit.
Poppy is a low key troll with her Rebecca Glasscock look and Ru’s Project Runway look for press interviews. And I love it.
Her reads were absolutely *hilarious*
There was an EW article recently interviewing Princess Poppy and she was very open about wanting to be completely forgotten from the drag race universe. She was half serious when she said she was quitting drag in her intro, it seems like it’s gonna be something she does occasionally from now on. That’s why she wasn’t really bringing much attention to herself, she doesn’t want to be famous.   the is the article: https://ew.com/tv/rupauls-drag-race-princess-poppy-interview-stepping-back-from-drag/
I mean there was a lot of queens just there, this was the Mistress show.
She seemed really offended by the joke about her accent
Definitely seemed like she was not having a good time tonight. Irene's read cut her DEEP.
Let Salina be, shes in her feelings and deserves her time alone to reflect and absord what happens
Honestly there might have been some drama that they didn’t air, the producers have been pretty kind to Salina so I wouldn’t be surprised if they cut it for her sake.   She had suspiciously no airtime the entire reunion beside that one extremely awkward moment (in which to be honest she was totally justified)
I don't understand what she's upset about.
Thank you for bringing this to my attention, I sent her some love.
What about it is bothering her?
I think Salina is just a bit too thin-skinned for Drag Race or being a public figure, she gets upset and lash out very often.
Probably because what she said about Ross
The captions said “Pretty kiss, Miss America” which must be a reference I don’t get
Ru has been saying “Prissy Kissness” instead of “Merry Christmas” for years… I don’t really get it, but Luxx was quoting Ru  [See here, for example](https://www.tiktok.com/@colbertlateshow/video/7176830038384364846?lang=en)  [Or an even older instance here](https://twitter.com/rupaul/status/281142307787505664?s=46)
If you’re not watching Roscoe’s viewing party you’re only getting 1/16th of the story
Yeah I was wondering why while watching it but I think it's fair because she has just lost her mum 😭
Her consolation for being the first out
Production was gracious enough to let us view Irene's full regalia.
It would have made more sense to have the top 4 all in the front row IMO
Yes!
I'll admit she flew under the radar for me for a long time but I am a Stan now. And Let Loose full out slaps
If you have Twitter, Insta, or TikTok, go let her know right now! Just comment on her most recent video!
When she started crying after the Connecticut caucus vid. I just wanted to give her a hug 💖
Bittersweet is the word indeed. It left me wanting to see the rest tbh. Happy we got it, but just sad on how much footage we lost.      ![gif](giphy|2wrCEs4kgstg2QWAr9)
It’s real, but also a joke. She’s selling chapstick
a lot of hispanic fans say salina’s accent is fake and ig Irene picked up on that and decided to say it to her on national television 😭
That her accent was fake
That she has a fake accent
They were not going to create the usual drama in this drag hating moment in time
Malaysia always looks good.
Per usu 🤭
YEAH
Honestly to me Loosey comes off as very genuine, which has it's problems but overall makes her a very endearing person. I feel she grew on most of the Fandom
Agreed! She won me over the closer we got to finale.
I would not be surprised if we saw Irene in season 16.
She looked so cute!!
She looked perfect
Also Poppy was iconic!!
That wig was perfection, one of the best-styled wigs ever on the show.
Did Jax have any lines? Cause I don’t remember any.
I hate that artificial blue contact color. It's not even natural - it just looks crazy.
Such a strange choice. I will never not hate those contacts
It was giving Coco Montrese S5 confessionals 🤣
Yes.
The edit too. They kept shadily cutting back to her when something more negative was said…
Like how did THIS cast have such a boring reunion??????
It was the wig for me 😬😬😬
*"Let's see what Sasha has to say about this!"*  Sasha:  ![gif](giphy|3o7WTQ7cLUxb9nhI1a)
You'll be happy next week when she put all that budget into her finale looks.
she didn't, it's a crystal gown version of that look, you can tell from the intro of the show.
I'm not disappointed. She's stunning!
I really thought it was the same look too, but when they were both on screen at the same time I saw they were, in fact, not the same. Still a shame she wore something so similar
It was a different look, very similar tho. This look was a dress not a leotard. The sparkly things went up and around her next here, on the leotard they ended awkwardly at her clavicles. Maybe she wanted to do a redo of the look? I agree it was a missed opportunity.
I was disappointed they didn't give Jax her moment when they were talking about the best lip syncs of the season! Jax should have been in that conversation for sure!
right! also she looked so fucking good my god ![img](emote|t5_2t3or|4822)
Because it just sounds like a white person being ignorant about code switching.
Probably stoned
salina is the cringiest queen of the season and that's saying a lot with aura right there
i mean a white person coming for a latine persons “latine” schtick felt weird and im glad she didnt let it slide unaddressed
No it’s good she stood up for herself - like did y’all not see her family’s video in untucked? her sister straight up as the same accent lol
Why would people laugh? Did it seem like something she was making a joke about? 😕
To be fair, 2/4 of the finalists are the quite kind.
Except she did say it? She said it to Loosey actually when Loosey mentioned she added fuel to her fight with Lux about the musical role Mistress mentiond " thats what she does" an giggled. Even Malaysia mentioned it , for drag queens is part of the "bantering".
She and Luxx can dish but get VERY defensive when anyone starts levying a meaningful criticism.
She also so obviously lost that lip sync
I couldn't believe how much she still had her back up about it.  I got that it must have sucked in the moment to not get your flowers, but I thought that by now she would have landed on something between "I can't control the judges decisions" and "I know I'm a winner and we both did great."  Instead, she got so defensive and started lashing out.  That's wild to me -- there's no shame in being outshone in a lipsync by Jax
the day before
They did not. At least they didn't air it.
i think that’s her contour, her face is painted a little lighter than her skin tone but her contour is WAY darker and it’s not blended in that great
just noticed that’s how she’s been painting all season (i think) but it looked so bad this episode bcs she was seated in the top row. i really dont understand why she needs to paint so heavy on her neck!
What show have you been watching?
Honestly she’s coming off so fake and produced here, it’s passed into cringe for me
i already made a comment about her earlier but she doesn’t WANT to be remembered, so it’s working!
Her talent show act (the duet with her deformed conjoined twin) was possibly my favorite of the night but yeah she went home real quickly after that
help why dont i remember her either LMAO 😭
People say Loosey is sensitive but nah, Salina NEVER takes reads very well.
She’s in her coco montrese era
I would rather her keep that budget for the finaleee
Yeah that was an… odd choice. It wasnt different enough to feel like a fun reference. It was visually just a repeat.
It was the dress version of the look. Also why does it matter why she wore it?
" she should make it clear she was only trolling/joking" , you want her to mention it on every sentence?Mistress has said it constantly since the start of the season,you are finding reasons to hate and it doesnt look good tbh
… we didn’t start the fire!
Not sure why Selina was unhappy. We didn’t hear much from her but the Golden Boot she seemed happy about lol
Aura: "Fuck my reunion"
I dont even like Loosey but that absolutely does not seem like something she would say lol, she doesn't seem mean-spirited.
My theory is that Irene made it up so she could be at the center of some Loosey/Mistress drama, but neither of them seemed to care much.
Did Irene say she didn’t talk to Mistress for three months after that phone call?
But Loosey was high safe
Ugh I wish she would be winner of the season too :( I know I'm in the minority though
it’s a reference to Chi Chi from “to wong foo” at the end of the movie
i've heard she's going through a rough time, so as much as it sucks she probably didn't 'make good TV' as Ru would say lmao
Agree! I love that she's sensitive but also a joke cracker. She was very honest this episode as well. She has so much heart that she really doesn't have to try to put on for the cameras despite what Mistress said all season.
I love Loosey
It taped the day before the finale- possibly just anxious/nervous
Stoned girlie
I talked to her last night at a meet and greet and she said don’t expect much from her this episode she was quiet. Said wait for the finale lol
Stoned + Anxious + Mentally preparing for the pageant of her life that was happening in under 24 hours
Is this not always Sasha? Literally, watch back anytime she talks with Ru during critiques, it's like she's stuck in thought.
The prize being $200,000 which means each girl would get the traditional $100,000 seems sus to me to be honest
…until Ru fully bowed down to Sasha Colby at the end lol (and Sasha deserves it)
it was “prissy kissness” quote ru said on the stephen colbert show
She looked so good!
Yeah, and for a diaspora girl feeling very between cultures I see why it affected Salina
my god pleaseee get off the internet 😭
Her sister had an accent though, didn't she?
Im not hispanic but i live in the bay and grew up in the ie, she def sounds like a southern california latine, i dont think shes trying to be bay area specific
I'm a LA native and, yes, I have heard that accent my entire 45 of 47 years in LA. (The other two were in SLC.)  Go to Boyle Heights, Van Nuys, the San Gabriel Valley, Santa Ana, and other barrios in SoCal and you will hear that accent from a lot of gay Latino males. Not all gay Latino males have that accent, but many do. And some Latinas have it, too.  This native Angeleno is proud of Salina EsTitties.
Appreciate your comment and the context. The inconsistency of her accent was what rubbed me the wrong way. She was playing it up for the camera when she was trying to be funny
She talks about being latina a lot to a point that it feels like overcompensating. Salina comes off really insecure and when she got called out she had a sour attitude about it rather than just laughing with everyone
They sound like all my cousins and tias, like what are your ties? Did you have a layover and stop by a King Taco in Santa Ana and think oh yeah I got a feel for these PAISITAS…  Also I have for sure heard that accent in SF and Oakland. Good grief.  Edit: Accents even vary from region to region. Dudes from Boyle Heights speak differently than folks from Riverside or people from Vallejo do it differently than those from San Jose. Y’all tripping.
Nah, as a Tejano her accent was fine. Miss titties code switches and it’s a blend of her experience. You’re not wrong for thinking it’s offensive, but consider that there’s a lot of us Latinos all over the US and not just in California.
I feel like no one else had anything good to say!!
But I would subscribe to an MIB blog so it’s all good.
Off topic but that post about your mom having gay porn on her pc is wild
Based off the reactions from Mistress and Loosey, it seemed like they were both hearing this story for the first time??? Is it at all possible Irene was trolling for fun and more screen time?
They didn’t resolve who lied though, so why assume it was Mistress and not Loosey? 🤨🤨
How do you know it’s a lie… cause Loosey said she didn’t say that. Could it be that Loosey is lying instead?
I stopped reading after you disrespected the absolute sanctitty of the name of Joslyn Fox.
And it would've been so boring if it wasn't
But she obviously lied about Irene’s sagging fillers.
Truth. 😂 Bob did a lyrical curb stomp.
And not because she will talk over you in all interactions before you can make a valid point?
Philo
or go to brokensilenze
Must b so fun to watch with u
Right? Irene literally called MIB out for spreading lies about Loosey. I'm sorry that's really not fucking cute. It's immature and vindictive on a disgusting level. I was willing to cut her some slack throughout the season because she had some funny moments, but seeing her in this reunion really cemented my opinion on her. She's the type of mean girl that will say Horrible shit and smile the whole way through so she can claim it's just a joke. Bully behavior.
ive been ranting to my partner about how they've been mean girls since heavy metal gate, they're talented but i hate that mean girl behavior
You’re that fan
look no further everyone we found the racist ru fans they were discussing during the reunion who hold so much misguided hatred for two confident self aware drag queens
Well hell, she’s got people who think she’s a cunt, people who genuinely like her, and people who only ironically like her. She’s a viral sensation and she’s getting shade from left right and center. She’s too traumatized from being marginalized and mocked in suburbia to have a healthy sense of humor about herself though she’s well aware that’s what she’s supposed to have. She is trying so fucking hard to do whatever it is she thinks she’s supposed to do. It must be fucking exhausting and confusing as hell. I love her.
It was the Mistress show with 15 guests definitely. But don’t blame it on her, if the other girls were boring that’s not Mistress fault.
Then the other queens should have given anything
She was the only interesting one
Get some taste.
Whether that’s who MIB was referring to or not, we won’t know. We can definitely blame the camera panning on the edit tho.
Literally what choice does she have?  If she expresses the fact that she is bothered what do you think is the resulting outcome from the other girls?  Or from the "fans"? Your comment lacks empathy; do better, gay.
?
Poor Loosey, she is not fake, she's polite repressed & perfectionist in grand Connecticut tradition.
Yeah, I was expecting for her to come in a little bit more in on the joke even with let loose it just felt like my girl needed to truly let loose
y'all just hate loosey, like just say it atp.
I'm gonna agree with you and welcome the downvotes for doing it lol.  That attitude she has in general turns me off of people.
And Mistresss said she did not say it. Just cause Irene said it doesnt mean its true . If you believe Irene when she was clearly thirsty as hell to do drama and be seen thats your problem lol
MIB bas been complaining that Lucy is not being herself and i can see that. Lucys replies are always politically correct but the girls say she is fun behind cameras. So i dont know if she said it or not but it could go both ways.
You don’t think Loosey would lie?   Hrmm something about that seems qwhite off… hrmmm… interesting
I've heard it's salina STDs
Yeah I think the playing the victim while taking swings was the biggest red flag for me from her this episode. Saying luxx was “punching down” implies that Luxx is more skilled and performing better in the competition, which given track records is objectively untrue. Similar to how she moved the goalposts of the argument when she admitted that she had been wrong about the beyonce look “but never wore a corset.” If Karen of the Season were an award, she would definitely have earned that trophy
This!!!! I know I’m biased buuttt you have perfectly articulated what I feel
Exactly. Its soo weird how the fandom victimize this sucessful 30 something drag queen. Its just very off putting
The real T was her talking shit about Irene’s filler and then being miss America saying she would never…   double standards isn’t the term you’re looking for, it’s racism, and they’re gonna downvote you to hell and back for speaking the truth but that’s how it goes.
Interesting.  I think production made all three of them look like assholes.  But I do believe that Luxx, the specific things she said and way she said them, made her come off like she was entitled.  I think she has been raised to be confident and she's talented and knows it.  Bully is a little strong.  None of those things are because she's black - it's because she's young.  Loosey came across like she was not self-aware enough to see that, despite being clearly talented, it still didn't equal what Sasha or Anetra were bringing - and that IS some White Privilege at play.  And MiB, just looks like she likes to read.  And that's because she spends a LOT of time with drag queens.
Loosey being white isn’t why I have the feelings I do. If there was any kind of queen of color in her spot I’d still think the same.   If there was a white person instead of Mistress and Luxx. I’d still think the same.   The way the two are acting is unlikable to me. They are constantly instigating shit and it’s hard to even say or react to it in a normal way. People are saying they’re bullies because they do act like it. I know from personal experience how shitty it is when people like this gang up on you and no matter what you say, OR STAY QUIET, you always get the short end of the stick.   I don’t mind if people don’t care for Loosey. But stop making it a racial thing when the issue is the attitude.
Rebecca Glasscock
it’s a reference to an infamous drag look from rebecca glasscock
It’s giving Nicole Paige Brooks
as you wish ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|downvote)
Thank you for not retracting your comment again. Speak your truth. ❤️
Bitch you’re a boring flop
Or them Coco Montrese contacts started bothering her
Will was secondhand exposed to drag content through me for years, but then All Stars All Winners happened and now he can’t miss an episode and he’s on this subreddit more than I am.
My husband says “yes, I will take you as my child.” Welcome to the House of Pajamas.
Ru really did seem proud of Robin's activism.
Sugar def seemed more subdued. Her voice even sounded deeper, like she wasn’t trying to sound as hyper as Spice.
At one point while Spice was talking, I thought to myself, "Am I having a stroke?"
Spice just gives me unmedicated ADHD
For her own look too.
![img](emote|t5_2t3or|4811)
jax did answer that she felt her and mistress were pretty even!
I’m a little bit very gagged that Rupaul did ask this very question to Jax AND she answered but no one remembers bc she was that invisible in the reunion ![img](emote|t5_2t3or|4805)
Who's to say Ru didn't ask Jax? The editors clearly loved what Mistress was giving throughout (and who can blame them) but they didn't make any effort to hide it in terms of how unbalanced the screen time was lol.
So many? Who seemed nervous to you? I didn't get that
I personally loved hearing Poppy say she was quitting drag. Not as a joke, but just as a statement.
They're original, but nonsensical lol
Oh they're original.  They're VERY original lol.
Oop
At the very end of the episode they had an image of four queens that had recently passed, including Heklina.
At the end they had a tribute screen for legends we lost this year: Heklina, Crystal Woods, Lily Savage, and Darcelle XV.      Edited Waters to Woods, should have paid attention to autocorrect before hitting post 🤦🏻‍♂️
Krystal Versace was LITERALLY BORN TO DO DRAG THO?
Poppy desperate to be forgotten from the world of drag race only for Ru to appoint her as her successor 😌 love that timeline
Yeah I feel this was one of the more dramatic seasons we have had in a couple years , yet this reunion felt like they sorted it all out lol
yeah but i feel the same thing happened with sasha velour too
The winner is often not a huge feature of the reunion. Especially since the biggest fan faves often arent involved in any drama.
This is why this season is obsessed with being 2nd place
Quite a few have publicly said Anetra, so I think it's probably the opposite -- Sasha has been 100% winning since day 1, and they can't have a reunion full of girls say Anetra and then crown Sasha lol
Mortal Kombat x H. R. Giger tbh
It would have been cute but then the engagement news happened and I was like 😬😬😬
Drag Race fans realise that most queens are not monogamous challenge
Honestly it seems kinda shady that Ru didn’t say her name. Like, no bitch, I’m not giving you publicity.
I wonder if she was off because of the backlash she got from her Ross video and the loss of her mom? She’s been through it the past couple of months.
![gif](giphy|KdIt7mzbeUQrC)
[removed]
It took me longer than I'd care to admit to realize it was a Rebecca Glasscock look lol
Her read  mentioning covid had me rolling.
Her mom died two months ago. It can’t be easy going through all this without her.
Yeah I dont get it at all. We saw on the show that the way she speaks in drag is not how she speaks out of drag sooooooooo….?????
I'm assuming it's Irene's joke and/or the golden boot but otherwise i can't think of anything else
Oof the sad part is I did watch but I don't remember anything Aura said except who she doesn't get along with. I was too mesmerized by Robin Fierce and her chicken tenders.
This got a big cackle out of me
She was just trying to get through it. Her heart wasn’t there.
For me to.   The moment she said "I'm fucking pissed"   I was all in for miss DeLuca
And wispy lashes lol
Lmfao amazing
Do they? Cause I’m Hispanic from the east coast coast and her accent would not be out of place here.
okay yea that is kind of dumb lol. a lot of people can switch their accent on and off.
No truer statement has been said  ![gif](giphy|rUHPv7oVmJ4s1xNKxk)
she talked about her look with the snake and said a couple nice things, thats all i remember tho
RuPaul: Robin, you're from Connecticut.   Robin: I am.  RuPaul: Mistress, what are your thoughts on Robin being from Connecticut?   Mistress: Listen, at the end of the day...
Because of social media. Everyone (or some) already hashed out their issues publicly so there's nothing spicy they can talk about at the reunion.
I was shocked
Was it..a mullet?
🧿👄🧿
Jax v Robin was a great lipsync, it should have been acknowledged!
I was honestly thinking the same thing. None of the girls were being rude about it either. They just were giving their opinion and she just shot back with “well I’m in the final and you’re not” 💀 like damn sis it’s not deep
Didn’t they used to film after the finale? I always thought that was super weird to film the reunion afterwards. Does anyone know why they do that?
I figured her neck was her natural skin color. Her face was lighter from the highlights but her neck seemed forgotten   It was very distracting and all I noticed when the camera turned to her
The season would’ve literally been so boring without her narration though…
Girl, please. Her entire schtick is over production. She literally gives you a wink, nod, nudge, and eyeroll to communicate it.
Omg same I found myself actively wanting anyone but Mistress to answer questions 😭 The “eras” the canned heeheehee’s…cringe.
Not me trying to reread the comment to the tune of the song
I mean her mom only died two months ago. Those mom videos must‘ve been *rough*.
Yes because loosey said she never said such a thing about Irene's fillers so who's lying lol 😂
Her and Luxx battling for second ✨✨✨
Loosey definitely had a something amazing with the political moment!
Mistress is a powerhouse, wish she got more fan support cause she made s15 her bitch
Yeah but the execution, lord have mercy
Oh damn when did they start filming reunions BEFORE finale? I’ve been watching thinking it’s being filmed afterwards
Ah okay, thanks!
Agreed. Like I wouldn’t want to talk either if someone made fun of how I was speaking
Thank you for reading my comment and understanding what I meant. I also understand some will defend the accent and say they hear it but it wasn’t about that. I think if more people went back to Salina’s own statements they would understand more of what I’m trying to say. You don’t pick up an accent like hers after admittedly saying you used to be embarrassed by it, you pick it up by watching over characterizations of latin stereotypes on tv. Hence why I mentioned in another comment the Chi-chi homage.
I love a confident Latina queen and I love that she turned around and embraced her latin side after saying she used to be embarrassed of being, but I kind of agree that she is overcompensating. Maybe overcompensating with a little bit of guilt. It’s a little bit of inception to me, she’s a drag queen that wears a costume of a character. Salina feels like John Leguizamo in drag, including the accent, ironic that her reunion look just happened to be chi-chi. Inspired by? Maybe. A little Too Wong tho. Pun intended.
I dunno man I grew with uncles that have Florencia tattoos on their shaved heads. Going to the motherland in Michoacan, where I drank soda in bags with a straw. Then hanging out with my gay mexican aunts back home in SF while they took me to drag shows because I was their token gay boi.  PS King Taco sucks, the original TACO KING(not the same) in Upland was better, but it closed. Don’t go all jabroni on me foo.
Lol yeah being gay and having a homophobic closeted preacher parent is kinda insane.
Or Irene.
I wonder why 💭…
Mistress’s reaction gave it away. The giggling, “I don’t remember that conversation”, and “let’s move on”. She got caught and deflected.
Exactly. Or it could be Irene? But noo the fat latino has to be the one lying..mmm..
I full enjoyed it!
![gif](giphy|gf6R79O7aviK7UFwea)
i still like mistress, but that moment was… 😬😳
Either that or Irene lied about the whole thing to snatch some airtime while she had the chance, which wouldn’t surprise me either
Why are you believing one and not the other
I just wanted them to speak their truth like they say they do. We saw Luxx BS through that excuse why she singled out Loosey. Lets be fr
I mean, they literally just stated facts.
I'm a perfectionist and it can be so intense to feel like your entire self-worth is tied up in a single thing (game, test, performance). I suspect Loosey has that tendency as well so I feel very tender towards her.
That's a lot of emotion for "confused" and I love it.  I love Loosey! I just think her reunion outfit is WILD *Bob voice*.
I mean Ru kept Mistress front and center of the dialogue for a reason.  Irene meanwhile kept butting in
She's not polite though lol
I don't hate her (IDK her) but I definitely don't vibe with her actions on the show. She comes off as disingenuous and I am not a fan of her drag either. I think that's obvious from my comment lol.
Agreed, there's a line that gets crossed.
????? Tamar did you watch the show?  All the bitch said was " *giggle* lil old me? I -I don't even remember. Omg. All I can say to you loosey is that I'm not a liar and that's all I'm gonna say. I don't even remember this happening omg"  She def did not say she didnt say it. Don't embarrass yourself defending the undefensable.
If you believe they didn't CLEARLY put her front and center for the purposes of being SPICY, then I have a very tall, strong beverage for your thirst.  LOL   As Alaskas says, "We haven't see the last of Irene".
Really don't understand where this narrative that Lucy is fake is coming from. If anything Loosey was way too sincere and wore her heart on her sleeve, sometimes to her own detriment. MIB on the other hand spent the entire season saying bitchy defensive shit through her little grins but yall are calling her 'real' for it? Like yall are free to like her, my comment is just my opinion on her and she's just not for me.
Her name has layers sweetie
What does age even have to do with anything? So stupid
Okay but why???? Lmfao
The flair ☠️
Lol what’s this referring to? Not liking Irene? Yeah, I don’t get why so many are hoping she gets cast in all stars or does a vanjie next season.
You’re beautiful. ❤️
Her eyes were super pink for sure
You’re in your adoption era
Absolutely. Robin had said in the show that she was playing it safe and now what she's doing is the opposite. She could stay at home or stay at her home bar being confy but instead of that she's doing things. Ru loved it.
RIGHT LOL
Nobody would say that because she asked Jax on air lol
sugar and spice, aura, jax a little bit. it’s not a bad thing at all just an observation, like i said i’d be nervous too it’s basically snatch game but ur playing urself lol
Crystal Woods* Crystal Waters is very much alive
Ru called Sasha a spiritual leader and “mama” last week, and this week said she amazes her.   Yet there have been more than one “born to do drag” contestants on the show, according to Ru’s commentary: Jorgeous in addition to Krystal.
you spilled
Wasn’t aware her mom passed. I hope the fans can be kinder to her during this time
The Vixen walked out
>That was when Vanjie walked out and we had Asia vs RuPaul (which was honestly a serve)  I think you meant Vixen 💀
Vixen*
Wasn’t it Vixen who walked out and had Asia step up and speak out for how the situation around the Vixen was handled?
It was The Vixen that walked out. And yes, Asia and Ru had quite the intense exchange. I can honestly see both sides, but Asia's emotions were raw and touching.
The vixen not vangie
You the mean the Vixen walked out
Vixen was the one who walked out.
miss vanjie...
*The Vixen
vixen walked out, not vanjie  ◡̈
Wasn’t it Vixen who walked out?
Vixen***
Vixen
Vixen not Vanjie 😅
Vixen walked out not Vanjie lol
The Vixen
*The Vixen
It was vixen who walked out cause rupaul kept going after her
*Vixen lol
Vixen not Vanjie
Think you meant Vixen lol
Now I gotta watch S10 reunion because that is some tea
And I believe she even discussed this on a podcast or during a show or something. So she's acknowledged it.
The 👢 didn't come with money this season?
Omg that’s hilarious
It would also be normal for someone Hispanic in Stockton where she grew up, but there are some folks weirdly obsessed with Salina being “fake” for whatever reason. 🤷‍♀️
Her accent is fake and she’s not from the east coast
Yep lol I understand where Salina comes from. I’m from a border town in Texas, live there and in San Antonio on and off and my accent fluctuates depending on the area. Too Mexican for San Antonio, yet too “white” for Laredo. Can’t please em all.
There’s wi difference between code switching (done for survival) and doing it for a character
Or they know they're in danger of their insta getting reported and taken down right before the finale
Exactly. And like when Ireme was (correctly) explaining how Mistress was amplifying the conflict, she cut her off and was very dismissive about the statement.
They definitely filmed after the finale for season 9 and 10, and you can tell because Shea and Asia were not holding back even a little because both queens knew they'd already lost. Maybe that's why, because it was kind of possible for people to guess a week in advance who was possibly going home (even though it made some amazing TV)
Probably because the final 4 need to focus on getting ready to compete rather than doing a reunion.
She was definitely wearing a foundation darker than her skin color as “contour” in her under chin, looked a little weird from the angle she was being shot from.
Yeah the season was amazing. She didna great job most of the time. It only really got stale in the final 20% for me, mostly just too many repeated catch phrases. Basically canned bits ironically lol
I’ve had it with the heeheehee’s even more than with the eras.
Gurl I do NOT believe Loosey would say that lol. Loosey seemed shook hearing what she supposedly said.
Amen! I grew to love her so much this season! And her 'eras' thing is stupidly iconic! Among other iconic moments she's had... she's all over this season, in the challenges and elsewhere!
Then you would have heard the wide diversity of accents. There is no one accent. The Bay Area for example has a lot of Mayan folks from Southern Mexico and they speak one way. There’s a lot of folks from Guadalajara in LA and they speak another way.   There are also people who are pocho and don’t fit neatly into category A or B, they exist in the in/between and their accents vary significantly.  So “I dunno man”, sounds like you need to just acknowledge that your lived experiences can contradict those of others. Boxes are great for packages from Amazon, terrible for people.
Mmmhm 👀👀
And not 1 person in the cast is brave enough to call her out lol.
Girl you're desperate to make this into something it's not. You can be fat and a horrible person too.
Irene clearly wasn’t lying. Mistress or Loosey would’ve said something if she was. Instead, Mistress giggled and quickly tried to end the conversation.
Hum because I have eyes.
You know EXACTLY why they’re doing that
You're entitled to your opinion love :)
You mean you just wanted them to speak *your* truth.  Diva, you’re that fan.
The Mistress stans are out in full force.  Like, embrace that she's a bitch.  MIB owns it most of the time...when she's not straight up lying at least.
Opinions are *literally* not facts though :(
that's fair !! i personally didn't care for loosey at first, but then i started loving her, honestly i don't get anything disingenuous from her, like i feel like it's more the perfectionist side of her coming out? idk it just feels like she's not like a "haha someone made fun of me let me join in on the joke" type of queen which is completely fine imo, doesn't make her disingenuous. i get ur point tho
RIGHT like IMMMMM a fuckin liar sometimes and i’ve PULLED. THAT. she’s just messy😭( but maybe so is irene for bringing it up)
" im not a liar"  " she def did not say she didnt say it" LMAO thats the same thing xD. Drag race fans are the worst xD
idk, id trust the contestant who is with Lucy instead of a viewer who is only seeing an edited version of reeality
Because it's campy and comfortable?
Why not?
Bc it’s funny
Nothing but respect for my S16 winner ❤️
Great looks and messy TV doesn’t always equate to good TV, so I understand. Whereas Mistress can navigate messiness while making it entertaining, there’s something about Irene that just misses the mark for me.  Edit: don’t know if you were asking what my flair refers to, but it was you saying “Loosey being the child of a cop checks out” and refusing to retract your comment after someone said your comment was disrespectful. I respect a Bitch who stands firmly in what they believe in. ❤️
You’re riding a fine line of being my next flair. Tread lightly, handsome. ❤️
yea you nailed it basically
Holy shit I am stupid.
I logged off of Reddit for a few hours and saw that I had 24 notifications and they WERE ALL comments correcting me 😨
Her three-chapstick-and-wispy-lash set may be the first thing I buy from this season’s girls cuz that’s actually genius lol
They are OBSESSED with policing queen’s speech patterns, but fail to understand that it would be a completely normal accent in a large urban area where Spanish speakers, Asian language speakers, and African Americans lived intermixed sharing the same community, going for the same schools for one. In the east coast it’s combined with a heavy Caribbean influence as well. These redditors live in a magical world where you can live in an multicultural multiethnic world for decades but none of these groups every intermix or influence one another in any way, I guess that’s the America republicans want.
Oh damn I forgot about that 💀 it rlly was the MIB reunion tonight. I think she just needs to let loose ✨ and breathe for a change
Her congeniality era starting every day was my favourite thing. And when she said she was tired of being at the Sasha Colby meet and greet. Icon
I don’t know why I have to keep saying that I never said the accent doesn’t exists.   I agree with you, I’ve, “heard a wide diversity of accents”, therefore I have formed an opinion that keeps being misinterpreted, the accent Salina uses is overdone and or fake. HER ACCENT that she is using, I’m talking about her, Salina Estitties.
![gif](giphy|l4JyX3V0yydvPHNBe)
Loosey said she didnt say it, Mistress found it funny and said she doesnt remember saying it and shes no liar. There is no "clearly" about Irene is not lying.You have any proof  that mistress said it aside from Irene's word? Exaclty there is no proof and considering how Mistress has always said everything she says in confessionals to the queens faces I find it stupid to say shes lying lol. She has always been very vocal to Loosey, why lie now? It doesnt make any logical sense xD
What you have is bias. All the girls in rosoces said lucy is fun behind cameras so she may or not have said it. MIB has been brutally honest, she does not need to lie now.
Yes we know your faves. For so much drama this season they didn’t really wanna talk!
Ironically enough, I love Mistress. She's a bitch and she's that bitch. That doesn't mean you can't address it.
MIB and Luxx being involved in all the drama isn’t an opinion though?
Did they or did they not have to explain themselves every 5 minutes that they didn’t mean it like how it was aired…? You can tell by other queens reaction no one was buying it lol
I honestly don't mind her not liking being made fun of, ita you don't have to "be in on your own joke" or laugh at yourself. Some of my fave queens were super uptight and in their heads lol (Miz Cracker, Miss Fame come to mind). My issue with her is that she sees criticism as an attack, and freely insults other queens in the process. She can never be honest about her intentions and calculations, but at the same time victimizes herself when others are. I'm personally sensitive to it bc ironically it's a dynamic I experience a lot as a black woman from white women. They aren't women but I found it fascinating to see it play out through this season.
Oh right, I'm a disgusting liar too. But I can guarantee you if someone confronts me about my lies I will either come clean or lie even more. You won't catch me going "uhm -uh? What? No I don't even remember", that's literally the only way you could tell on yourself lmao
Did MIB's delusion pass on to her fans too? Baby girl, stop it. Love yourself.
I mean, I agree but everything we're seeing is edited. Including the other contestants. By that metric everyone is fake because the person we're getting on TV is a very condensed version of the real thing.   I'm sorry I just don't think MIB is the most trustworthy source. Earlier this season we literally had contestants talking about a certain tantrum being thrown and her later denying it. You're free to like her and believe her as much as you want, as I said on my OP, she's not for me and I have the right to dislike her.
You know how people talk about toxic people in this fandom? Found them.
it’s been a bit 50/50 with Mistress too tho, her reads don’t always hit. who’s to say if Irene was on longer she wouldn’t have had some iconic moments?
Omg I remember !!!! I said what I said!!! ❤️ 😘  Edit: ooff that comment made these redditors pressed, but Loosey is still giving kid of cop energy, except in the reunion it was giving internal investigation realness with her agreeing to everything everyone said while her eyes were boiling with rage.
Thank you! Irene just comes off rude and as a try hard trying to be “shady.” Mistress knows she’s being messy but it’s always with a wink and nudge,and her jokes land!!! Clearly Irene couldn’t handle the heat or she would’ve not stopped talking to mistress.
I've honestly been looking for just a simple lash and chap. Girl knows her brand!
It’s honestly wild to me. The Stockton area is exactly what you’re describing, very racially diverse and a plurality that identifies as Hispanic/Latin, and if Salina’s channeling her aunties, who fucking cares? That’s her culture and experience.  Plus the video they’re using as a “gotcha” is an audition tape where she’s speaking formally about her drag experience. It’s almost like people talk differently depending on the context!
My mom has the absolute strongest accent, to suggest that “no one” and that a strong accent would come across as “offensive” is just wild.   I also have a strong accent and let me tell you, there are many more of us who are proud of her. I am proud of my accent, I don’t try to hide it any more. She represented well. The Hot Cheetos was art. The street signs were amazing. That’s my hood, I am very proud.  With that said, if you were misinterpreted, that’s on you.   I’m just here to say that there are dissenting views because you were leaning hard on your identity with that and I wanted to add a bit of nuance so non-Mexican people don’t run with your views as a fact. There are probably many more of us who would disagree with you. And that’s all I wanted to add to this convo. Cheers.
Because Mistress’s behavior gave it away. Anytime Loosey was “being fake” on the show, Mistress read her down.  But when Irene is directly calling Mistress out, all of a sudden she’s all giggly and saying, “let’s move on”.  No, girl, let’s talk! Tell the class what Loosey said.
Thank you for your unbiased approach 💀
Yep.  The funny thing is that the people calling out MIB on her behavior are overall being way more civil about it than the fans responding to them.
That’s not what the poster said. What you are doing is making an inference. Don’t get off track.
They answered questions they were literally asked??   You’re also excluding parts where Luxx specifically said watching parts back she saw how things came off.  You hear what you want  Last time: you’re that fan. Enjoy the finale!
" by the other queens reaction" they are all friends stop it. You are of those toxic fans the queens were talking about and they all hate. Get a grip and get over it.
oooh i completely see that. i have to say tho that a few of the times she was criticized on the season, it was rly hard to watch cause it was clear that they just didn't care for her. i get ur point tho!
Hi, it is me, Toxitina ❤️ you’re giving cop kid vibes too
Gurl, these redditors must come from some flyover suburbs, from the 1960’s or some shit. My high school had students from 136 different countries, we all spoke a jumbled word salad, and yeah that’s your formative years. It’s different than making a video years ago trying to portray a specific image. And guess what? My “professional” speaking voice has changed a lot in the last decade as I’ve felt more comfortable being myself, and less afraid to be discriminated (cause it’s gonna happen no matter what I sound like, we lie to ourselves thinking that if we sound “proper” it won’t).
Okay gracias.
Side note for anyone defending MIB after this: you cant call her real if she's only real sometimes. That's phony af.
Lucy is being politically correct in front of cameras and shady fun behind them. The alleged read is shady fun. MIB is shady in front of cameras, she can own another shady read. As it is it could go either way but OP chose to believe Lucy who is known to have 2 faces one on one off camera.
Lmao alright girl
Thats why I specifically mentioned the incident of her putting Loosey on the spotlight. Which is not an opinion but a fact. She stated it was not premeditated but lets be fr.
They respect each other thats a difference! Spice said it best, they are like family. Issues and all.
Y'all will call anything a "shady read" even though it's just "shady behavior", but go off love. Your entitled to your opinion and nothing you've said has changed my position or shed any light into this subject :)
![gif](giphy|JJQVvdx2eVF4Dwg7yp|downsized)  Glad to help you learn more about the words “fact” and “literally”  I’m in my educational era
Ngl, your need to respond to every comment to defend Loosey and say that MIB is a liar seems unhinged. Maybe take a break from social media for the night.
Damn you’re seriously bothered by other peoples comments. I think you misspelled Karen in your name
Haha, gather her. 10/10.  These are the same people who complain about the toxic fandom and then come on here and spew hatred instead of just admiring their favorites and moving the fuck along.
You replied to me not the other way around lol.  Who’s bothered?
Just based on this particular post I got that vibe lol
a few choices for top 10, however all eats as looks
I understand your opinion , but I do not have the same opinion
I loved Loosey’s babadook realness unironically
I forgot that Anetra look. She looks so good!
“Do you specialize in makeup artistry? Is your face a canvas for bold, colorful statements? Does Supermodel of the World RuPaul Charles tell you on a weekly basis she’s happy with the amount of makeup you’re wearing?   If so, these products aren’t for you.   Marcia Marcia Marcia from Season 15 of RuPaul’s Drag Race has formulated a line of luxury cosmetics for those of us who choose to highlight, and enhance our natural beauty. “  Three chapsticks that are the same shade (clear) and a pair of wispy lashes. She really knows her brand.
Lmao I thought this was a joke.
This is camp and this is CUNT, I live
Has anyone checked on Courtney?¿?¿ is she in Marcia’s basement.
It seems to be a real product, but it’s definitely a joke on her makeup this season. Which is why it’s not that expensive.
Brilliant way to sell merch and be in on the joke.
Wait, what’s todays date again???
The fact she's selling 3 lip balms and a single pair of lashes for 35 bucks is kind of brilliant... it's such a stupid joke but it's going to make her so much money and I have to respect that
I'd fucking love it if it's all empty packaging.
I desperately want an all white t shirt with her her eyes and makeup from her last lipsync   I need it in my life
New merch idea: Tammie Brown inspired used makeup wipes but they’re just blank
I can’t😂😂😂. There is more makeup in that box than Marcia has ever touched.
M3 is the secret self-aware comedy genius of the season and I love her. Unapologetic M3 Stan and I can't wait until she competes strongly but remains mostly unappreciated in All Stars.
I have never been attracted to a guy on the show. Marcia is so fucking sexy to me. I hope he has a lifetime of success.
"cosmetics"
I’m a sucker for a good joke and a good chapstick. Take my money Marcia!
brilliant product and marketing
what??
I fully thought it was a joke. But you know what, she finally found what to do with her crazy ass Stans, sell them bland make up (before you come for me it’s in the actual product description).
It’s not a joke??? 💀
is this real??
Barely there makeup.
April fools was last week?
HER MIND
Take my money bitch
*It feels like I’m wearing nothin at all, nothin at all, nothin at all*
The beauty brand for Chapstick lesbians.
Coming soon: Milan launches wig glue line
I legit thought you were just reading her lol. That really is the description
I’ve never laughed so hard in my entire life by this statement
Same. The fuck?  Edit: ok looking at the site I think it is a joke but maybe the product is real, like it’s just another merch item and not an actual cosmetics line
Bitch is smart.
marcia uses they/them, as a note
Yeah it’s def just white-labeled, not something she actually developed.
Yall too quick 😂😂
Not best buy barbie💀
This barbie runs a best buy like the navy.
This Barbie gets her screen time from speaking at Yale fucking Law 🤩
Honestly that's pretty cunt she worked at best buy in drag. Glad she got some moments during the reunion!
That’s where Salina and Gottmik got all those MacBooks from?
Cardi B looks great
Life moves fast but Reddit moves faster.

i was really grooving until she said “we’re fucking until the room stank.” please get right with god
Canadian Heritage worthy
I guess her and Brooke Lynn see the same doctor?
Cryingggg
The bottom anthem of the century
This.  Is. HOMOPHOBIC.  Somebody call Justin NOW
Well that fucking sucks.   If I subscribe to outTV through Prime does that mean I can watch it on the website at 930pm, anyone know?
It was on time with Crave
![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sob)
The technical issue: Loosey ended Luxx and Mistress live on television with a live rendition of Let Loose
Is this for Crave as well?
Oh this works for me. Having no electricity or wifi I have to wait till I get to work at 11:30 to watch lol
So far it’s not on Prime yet. I’d say give it til 1030.
I'm in the same boat 😩 It's 8:30 PM MST here and no episode yet. We are 2 hours behind EST so who knows when it will be on.
Please tell me this isn't you meeting, I unironically love that song
I'm currently an hour in on Crave Live.
Only half of it! I’m pissed
It's up on Crave now
If you come for me. I will apologize immediately. Lol Marcia relatable queen
Salina was PRESSED about Irene’s read lmao
It was nice of Coco to let Sasha borrow her contacts
ugh imagine having a short fling after a one night stand & then it ends, not dramatically, just fizzles out, then a year later u see that bitch on a reality show & the producers keep asking u to spill the tea but there is literally NO TEA so u just gotta look at the camera and smile mischievously and pray they don’t ask follow up questions
"this song went viral" *shows 2 clips*
"The only thing shorter than those heels is your life expectancy."  💀💀💀
Let me guess poppy’s read “the rumors are true, I did give someone on set covid … it was (insert queen). That’s why she has no taste”  Edit: got it!
WHO PREDICTED POPPY’S JOKE, you are the winner of this week’s challenge
Maddie ate her screentime
WAIT ARE SUGAR AND SPICE SUPPOSED TO BE LIZZIE AND ISABELLA FROM THE LIZZIE MCGUIRE MOVIE
The switch from Aquaria’s mug to Derrick’s is tragic
salina was not into it 😭
Even if Sasha didnt win, she had an extremely positive, near exceptional edit this season. I cant remember the last queen so openly praised like this!!
Sasha in the back just unbothered looking at the queens with her Mayhem Miller eyes
Hilarious that the previous two golden boots were for design challenges but all three of this years nominees were brought from home haha
Omg Princess Poppy showing up in Rebecca Glasscock’s entrance look?!
#WHY WAS THIS READING CHALLENGE CUT OUT FOR TODRICK?!
The way Sasha and Anetra are getting the Robin edit this reunion lmao.
I can’t believe Ariana is SheDevilByNight
how the *fuck* did they not air "I'm the motherfucking queen of drag, I'm amazed by you"
Aura: I want to fuck Poppy  Aura: I'm engaged
I have whiplash from Aura saying she has a crush on Poppy, and then immediately announcing she’s engaged
toot = fart = fluff, I got you twins
The unseen footage is giving so much context as to each of these challenge wins, which is really fascinating. Dammit MTV get your shit together!
NOT LOOSEY GOING AFTER LUXX FOR WEARING THE PUPPET'S WIG!  SHE'S DOING IT!  SHE'S LETTING LOOSE!  IT'S HAPPENING!
Spice why did you say Aura should have been in the bottom?  *Random hot girl noises*  Alright thanks for clearing that up.
MADDYYYYYY UGH FATHER IS FATHERING
Ok yall tonight are so hot and cold  "WE WANT DRAMA TONIGHT THIS IS BORING"   Then drama gets shown and yall go "no.....this is so awkward and cringe I cant turn it off"   Im happy Loosey got that off her chest
Not me crying at Connecticut
“You’re gonna become a millionaire with that phrase”  Ru IMMEDIATELY sniffed out a money-maker
Malaysia slamming the door in Mistress’ face is on constant replay in my head.
“HEHE i still think jax won” fucking hell i love Salina
Salina thanked Luxx bc her monologue was the first compliment Salina got all season omgggjsuduwbvwhr 💀⚰️
Yale doing what Drag Race didn’t, gave Robin time to talk
"Who the fuck has my baby" was not a line I expected to hear today
Spice has an unlimited supply of the most powerful edibles known to man
People who don’t understand Poppy’s look…. Do you watch the show?
So Ru couldn't get Joan Rivers corpse to make an appearance?? Disappointed
oh good we're going to bring up Amethyst and Robin's relationship again because that's been such a riveting storyline
Ok Luxx, that "my mother made that wig, it's a family heirloom" was legitimately hilarious.
is it just me or does salina just seem pissed/checked out
Please also keep in mind, Biqtch Puddin' is hosting a Twitch show called METAMORPHOSIS tomorrow and Race Chaser is hosting a show on the 13th that will *also* benefit the ACLU Drag Defense Fund
I’m sorry Sasha’s fucking contacts are taking me out
NOT SERVING CUNT IN THE BEST BUY
Salina's streetlamp is about to win GOLDEN BOOT
salina is already upset and i feel a golden boot is unfortunately coming her way someone help my poor girl 😭
And Tennessee just getting worse, ousting black delegates for no reason that are speaking for the people..  These old perverted gun loving fucks will not win. We will fight back
Anetra talked so little they turned off her mic lmao
![gif](giphy|3o72FaKt5kTvpJUnXG|downsized)  FUCK, Sasha looked good in that aerial shot
The unseen footage of Ru staning Sasha is mindblowing how much Ru loves her
The twins really do share one brain cell and don’t even know how to use it lmao
"can we talk about the international implications" of let loose??? i fucking live for the twins
holy shit the accent read
Mistress: I've never met a drag queen with a fake accent  Max: ám I a jöke to you
KEEP MY DAUGHTER’S WIGS OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MOUTH
I will forever blame Todrick Hall for robbing us of that reading challenge during the season.
WHERE IS THE USER WHO PREDICTED POPPY’S JOKE I CANT FIND YOU
DADDY MORPHOSIS IS BACK!!!!
Lmfao are they airing entire Luxx’s dissertation and making Loosey watch 💀💀💀
I love how they’re airing the entire thing all over again
Sasha’s contacts make me jump every time
I'm gonna need a Vanity Fair Lie Detector video with MIB and Loosey about that filler comment.
[prissy kissmass for those who didn’t understand](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRcccXhg/)
i love all this unseen footage, and I swear MTV will RU the day !!
Rupaul should have really went for it and brought out Aja
“I’m amazed by you!!” 🥹🥹🥹
I'm glad we got to see Sasha's alien outfit in the music video itself without the black and white filter
Love sasha’s Reality star vs Pageant girl internal struggle
Heklina😭
Oof, and then they just punched me in the fucking heart there at the end. 😢
The amount of people completely missing the Rebecca Glasscock reference is making me feel ooooooolld.
We really missed some gems with Irene going first episode
Maybe I'm in *my* congenial era but like... I really hope that Salina's okay and that she can come away having had an overall positive experience 'cause she's been kinda breaking my heart post main season.
Princess Poppy is giving contestant on Next energy
this is gonna be 30 minutes of content 1:30 of commercials at this rate
Irene is like "I will get my fucking screentime tonight bitch"
I got a little crush on Poppy oh btw I'm getting married!!!  Girl what
Poppy as Rebecca Glasscock was not on my bingo card, but holy fuck do I love it.  &#x200B;  Edit: [For anyone who doesn't get the reference.](https://imgur.com/r3h6xRG)
It's All Coming Back to Me by Selena
aura flirting with poppy right before announcing her marriage what is going on
Whats going on in Spice’s head while attempting to talk  ![gif](giphy|5x89XRx3sBZFC)
Spice sounds like my brain first thing in the morning before I take my Concerta lmao
Every time the twins speak they ramble on and they don't quite realize it but the others all do and it's cute to see them just smile at the twins and not get mad at them for it.
NOT THE LIFE EXPECTANCYYYY
WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN IRENE AND SALINA?!
Irene went home first and I still remembered her over Amethyst, Robin, or Princess Poppy
[removed]
salina's metallica runway... it's BAD, but i really can't bring myself to hate it. the lamp hat really pulls it all together in a campy way
tbh Jax’s moldy swamp oompa loompa might be the most offensive thing I’ve ever seen
Aura is actually so relatable... she's so awkward up there and I feel SO seen
hi moderator arianna grande
RuPaul speaks so well when it comes to shit like this. Gets her point across while still smiling and acting unbothered. I love her.
CT has come a long way. Even the rich and conservative towns are leaning more blue now and I see so many pride signs around those neighborhoods and schools now
Spice just talking about whatever whenever she feels like it lmao
Loosey and Mistress  ![gif](giphy|sanoHrtWDN5ew)
I hate Chris Pratt, I hated everything about that effing weird commercial  ![gif](giphy|A0Sa3PL1AhVn4iVdJp)
Anetra did one of the best talents ever
I miss when they asked the eliminated girls who they thought should win
Ru saying “I am the queen of drag and I am amazed by YOU” Sasha should’ve just been crowned then and there
**BUT** credit to Marcia for speaking out against said trolls/alleged fans
As much as I love Sasha so much and she’s been my pick from day one can we please retire those terrifying contacts… do you think she wore them because her eyes were red? 😭
Princess Poppy as Becky with the Glasscock is gay rights
don’t get me wrong i love sasha colby but those contacts are giving me miley cyrus meme (you know the one)
"What's less prison time?" I fucking love Mistress' TV capabilities
“Nice to see you, Eileen” perfect
Not them dressed as Lizzie McGuire and Isabella I love them 😂
I love Irene
 Let loose as a lip sync song when
NOT GIVING NINA WEST A TV JUMPSCARE JESUS CHRIST
Race Chaser and Dipper's inability to cue that sound on time is the reason LeT LooSE I SAID LET LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSE went viral
The next presidential debate must feature a question about the international implications of Let Loose
Sorry I'm late why the fuck is Sasha 🔵👄🔵 rn
If I were on this show, I’d invent a compelling romance with another cast member to assist our longevity. Entirely fabricated.
Oh werk, Aura's getting gay married <3
You know what, poppy has the nerve to come to reunion like that. Truly a camp queen. Truly a queen of culture. Iconic behavior
Robin’s mom about to have more screen time than Robin.
Aura asking if poppey wants to sleep with her then announcing she is getting married 10 seconds later is WILD
#I BLOCKED HER  LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Derrick what is this mug girl
Derrick - filming mid-paint?
what the fuck is spice ever saying
Loosey’s reply to the ‘blame it on the edit’ question was handled well imo
Omg “so spice are you speaking English?” got me good
Aura’s mom ate her up I fear
omg production is lowkey stalking us… like they’re bringing up all of our topics of convo: Poppy’s fake covid test, Let Loose, Loosey’s blame it on the edit era
Fuck MTV for those edited episodes cause this wouldve been such an amazing reading challenge
Fat cabbage patch 😭😭
SALINAAA
user who predicted poppy's joke: you are the winner of this week's challenge. you win a cash prize of $5,000.
has a top 4 ever had less screentime in the reunion than Anetra rn that was the second time she’s spoken
YOU ROUND TO THE NEAREST TEN
love how the Golden Boot is becoming an official title that requires a step-down now hahaha
conspiracy: eliminated queens know their original looks aren’t going to be aired so they can improve them over the months between filming and airing hence why they always look so good
"I will tell my grandchildren that this is drag." Ru please she's already dead
She’s taking it better than I thought
Yessss Maddi, oh how I miss u
Salina is happy to finally get some acknowledgement and reunion screen time
Salina sniffing the boot  ![gif](giphy|uJsPctwwIh9sKCXgV0)
i really don't think salina did that bad with the metallica runway, jax had green slime going on 😭
First Golden Boot winner who brought the look from home.
i feel like jax (who i love) had the actual worst look out of those, that oompa loompa look is just something i don't even wanna look at 😭 and marcia's dentist look was worse than her tie dye for me!
The fact that all three Golden Boot nominees were looks they brought from home is sending me
NOT THE REDDIT CALL OUTTTT
mistress “now why am I in it” brooks
Tbf to Danny’s daughter I’d also be mad if my dad went on Drag Race and didn’t tell me  And very confused
ARIANA REVEAL YOURSELF
Ariana thanks for modding tbis sub it’s a thankless job but you let us let loose
Damn every feature of Salina has been backhanded 😭 that Ali wong part
YES! That is an amazing achievement for Robin Fierce. Yale fucking LAW that's a big deal
It’s the Connecticut Era.
NOT WHILE LOOSEY'S CRYING LOL
Irene said she’s getting her screen time one way or another
Not Anetra keeping the baby closeted smh
ANETRA YES  ![gif](giphy|3o7TKEPO1bjPaOtGSc)
This segment is lowkii weird going from Mistress probably lying about the filler going to social media...damn
spice is just happy she has a drag family that's not only sugar 😭
Proud to be a Connecticut-ie right now!
I didn’t get Luxx’s comment either, can someone explain it 🤣
Not me getting an ad for “The New Conservative Alliance” while watching DRAG RACE. MTV APP READ THE ROOM
Breaking those boards will never, ever, ever get old, ever. It’s always amazing
I knew this was coming lmao noguing
Anetra is so pure
Ru giving Six Flags old guy
Amethyst lovingly petting her stuffed raccoon in the bg
This unseen footage is making me so mad that the music video wasn’t in color!!! Sasha’s outfit is perfection!!!!
Sasha loves the camera and it loves her right back!
The little tribute at the end to 4 pioneers we lost. Good job editors
i’m still not over sasha’s performance in the music video. she really slayed
Love that rest in perfection ❤️
Glad we had that memoriam moment
Sugar x Spice genuinely have nothing but tumbleweeds up there I’m obsessed
I don’t think sugar or spice can form coherent sentences and I kind of live
The Twins are making NO sense rn but I’m living for the cringe
Sasha over this lmao
WE'RE ALL HOT WE'RE ALL SICKENING WE'RE ALL TALENTED.   Getting it tatooed
Me forgetting we had short episodes at first: Wow there’s so much unseen footage this reunion.
I think Ru genuinely likes Anetra, even without the duck walking, he smiles easily at her
**CROWN SASHA THEE COLBY GODDAMNIT**
NOTHING on poppy’s statement?
Ru telling Anetra she would become a multi millionaire because of walking the duck is equivalent to Simon Cowell telling Carrie Underwood she would sell more records than any other American Idol winner
Aww they’re all celebrating let loose
“Do a trick pony” is one of the worst joke adlibs I’ve ever heard, the twins are so fearless 😩💀
derrick looks busted
I can’t tell if Ru loves the twins or despised them but it’s definitely one or the other with no in between
You know Luxx and Mistress lived for that covid Loosey read.
That settles it moms only next reunion
Thank god that lamp will be immortalized
Honestly I'd rather be memorably bad than somewhere in the middle
I'm glad Salina gracefully accepted them golden boot award! She seemed to genuinely be in high spirits about it. All lighthearted fun
ARIANNA SPOILERINAAA
Salina looks so mad
I love how we're finally seeing a glimpse of the edited out deliberations
Sasha is so hot. Am I a lesbian?
Thank god they’re bringing back solo numbers and then a final lipsync
i was not ready for the tribute 😭😭
Hearing RuPaul’s laugh consistently through the reunion just kept reminding me of Lawrence Chaney mimicking RuPaul’s laugh 😅😂😂
“I will apologize immediately” 😂😂 felt that
REBECCA GLASSCOCK'S ENTRANCE LOOK OMG
The twins feel like so long ago
SASHA SAID “THESE TWO TRYING TO FUCK”
"let's talk about both those challenges and who was number 1"  mother reminding everyone who mother is
This reunion is so fucking good so far.
loosey please let loose girl, throw a damn wig
![gif](giphy|OiuvzYYBXmx9bCf7FN)  I need more Anetra! 😭
is anetra in the room like 😭
 Not Heaven’s Gate
Maren Morris having to apologize for country music as a whole was so moving and sad at the same time

Omggggg Ru is amazed by Sasha!
Nice touching tribute at the end of reunion to queens who have recently passed, including Heklina.
Bring Irene back for next season COWARDS!!!
plz can we let the robin and amythest thing die i'm so uninterested
The question is not “Will Selina get it?” Its “which one of her outfits” lol
Ru you just summoned Aja like beetlejuice. With that noguing comment.
Marcia had the best intro
If Danny Trejo isn't a guest judge on Season 16, we riot.
Why does Ru say era like that lmao
irene!!!!  get her on all stars please!
I would turn Drag Delusion into a drinking game, but I'm in my pajamas and don't feel like going to the hospital in them
LMAO that’s the smartest thing Spice has ever said
Luxx being like “now don’t just do it out of nowhere” took me OUT 🤣
Fuck Robin’s wig, BRING OUT LUXX’S “40-INCH” WIG
Oh no, not Heaven’s Gate 🙅🏻‍♀️
Fully expecting Salina to get up and walk out the room in a few minutes
From inside the mind of Sugar and Spice:   I can see for MILES in here.
REDDIT SHOUTOUT
We could have like 5 hours of unseen footage at this point because of the beginning season shenanigans
WHEN MICHELLE SNEEZED I DIED “aaahhh!!!” 🤣
CT showing what it means to be a leader and advocate for their residents, we love to see it
The state of Connecticut making me cry over here.
They just took a commercial break to explain it to Sugar & Spice
Finally some airtime for Anetra
Ru had her coffee enema before filming Daytona Wind
Yayyyyy. That was an amazing reunion
So you’re telling me that Anetra was gonna go full @rpdr_nolimbs on that baby?
*I may have gone home first, but I'm also a bitch*  -Socrates
Ru really said let’s skip over the first few eliminated
I remain shocked that they did the twinsynch so early in the season
my bf and i always lose it at “I prep because I’m easy”
That was NOT Rosie!! You didn't say cutiepatootie once!! Not once!!
they’re really giving us what we want with the let lossification
I feel like Loosey consulted with a PR person before this episode lol
Salina about to cry lol. The girls did say Salina was the most sensitive.
I will say that Irene does NOT let shit go lol
Omg I can't wait for the Golden Boot. I hope it's Salina for the sign post because she already looks super pressed.
SALINA IS SALTY SITTING IN SILENCE
loosey getting real bold when she wore the same blonde hair almost every runway 😭 it was funny tho
watching this in connecticut right now, all i can say is :,)
Clock the flair, etc., but Sasha Colby truly is the winner this season needs and deserves.
This Connecticut bit is camp I’m obsessed
i live in ct right now for school and haven’t found my way here yet, but this made me realize i may belong here more than i thought 🥹
did Anerta say anything this whole reunion besides talking about that baby doll?
Ru is LIVINGGG lmaooo
I have such a crush on Janelle Monae, she’s perfect.
*RuPaul's Drag Race: The Reunion: The Feature Film*
Every Sasha moment was amazing  Music video, Neck Crack, Lalaparooza, Karl in the musical, the Golden Girls challenge, lile SO MANY MOMENTS
CROWN SASHA
Clock the flair… but I really need Sasha to win this
This is honestly turning out to be one of my favorite seasons!!   Idk *who* said it but the multiples-of-3 seasons are just…*correct*
Marcia’s entry line was stellar  “If you come for ME, I WILL apologize immediately”
Not Ru asking for itemized lists of stolen items
Era? Tired  Epoch? Inspired
Ru’s getting a kick out of everyone tonight
I love “It’s all coming back to me now” by Selena
They look so uncomfortable, why do we need to revisit this?
LOL MAMA FIERCE HAS QUESTIONS
Not Robyn’s mom having more screen time than Robyn
Even robins mom is itching to see someone fight
SO SPICE ARE UOU SPEAKING ENGLISH DHDHXHSJSJDHD
NOT THEM TEACHING MOMS HOW TO READ
Don’t let Aja see this ballroom Burger King commercial 😨😰😰
ITS ONLY ONE GAP lmao
A family hairloom
They officially stalk Reddit. The amount of references they are making. We see you girls.
I cannot believe Irene was in one (1) episode and has been featured SO much this reunion
Do they really not understand the twins’ rambling? I’m from Jersey so I speak Long Island but still
Damn the twins are crazy.  They need to get out the house more
I understand the twins but I live in NJ, it’s a very tri-state way of speaking for youngsters, fumbling over their words and then going back and starting again and getting faster and faster.
Wow. Luxx's speech really was like 10 minutes long 💀
They see! They see us!
MTV robbed us of ALL that content yall
Cause if you didn’t watch the reunion, you’re only getting a third of the story!
Jax is just not gonna talk this whole episode 💀
Ok Connecticut bring out ur gays!!
Why Jaxx look confused? 🤣🤣
This is gonna be the systematic breakdown of Loosey I swear
Ru neverrrr. Lol I quote that all the time
Salina lip syncing the burning part is all of us
Rupaul looks like he’s going to explode in this Mistress unseen footage omg someone help him
We’ve barely heard anything from Salina
THE PURPLE
WHAT A COMPLIMENT!
Just realizing Sasha's doing the eye-o-graphy from Missy Elliott's "The Rain" video there.  so cool
Purple Robin, Poppy, and Jax. Survivor fans understand
OH and the tribute to some of the fallen fore-mothers of drag T_T
mistress CARRYING this reunion
People in this thread not understanding Poppy’s look are really telling on themselves tonight🫢
Ooh the fake accent AHHHHH  **IRENE**
Salina was bothered lmao.
Maybe let’s not call it “Heaven’s Gate” specifically lol
I'm glad they're actually addressing the toxic fans
Aja  just choked lmao
Sasha Winner Colby, Ru loves her so much
Someone get Sasha some eye drops
Just found [This video](https://youtu.be/4cSTUCjN-AY) of Monica Munro doing the Diva's song from 5th Element Amazing!!
sasha’s contacts r making my eyes water
I so badly want Anetra to just be like "Speaking of receiving hate, I had one person make a four hour video about me...not sure what she said, I didn't watch."
Can we bring back Danny Trejo though
I don’t want money on Sugar or Spice to win a competition…but do I want them at a party? Oh yes
Screen time era 😭
I almost forgot to let loose
Loosey’s energy is like she’s on a job interview for AS9
why they keep zooming to loosey like she is a ticking bomb
I’m not liking Sasha’s blue contacts
Selina “it’s all coming back to me now” - Ru’s face in response to that just cracked me up
Loosey wants to punch MIB.
This date storyline would mean more if we knew literally anything else about them lol
Not poppy getting up to leave after hearing Aura is getting married.
Aura is getting married?! How sweet, good for her
When you need someone’s mom to come in to start drama tho 😂
it feels like so many of these girls are holding back
COVIDGATE OH MY GOD ITS HAPPENING
A brick gets laid LOL
I blame MTV for not blessing us with this footage
Heavens Gate challenge /s
Luxx’s heavy breathing before the 40-inch gate 😭
40 inches of heirloom!
Salina is not feeling it and she’s prob gonna get the golden boot
omg REDDIT
Omg hi Ariana thank you for dealing with our crazy asses
Daddy 🤠😷😍
Amethyst gives good reaction shots.
Luxx "The Block" London
The cameraperson was shadyyyyyyyy
REPRESENTING AFRICA doesn’t get old😭
I would really love just an hour and a half off unseen footage from WOW we missed SO MUCH
Sasha omg 🥵🥵
Sasha certainly has pluto in 1st house or similar placement
Yeah Sasha getting told “I’m amazed by you” def means she’s winning.
I know everyone saying Mistress is talking too much, but like... almost everything has been direct, specific questions to her.
Princess Poppy wins the reunion looks I'm sorry like she's so mother for that
Come thru Drag Defense Fund
Sasha “who’s number one tho” 😂
Mistress’ nipple is getting more screen time than Robin
Sasha is humble but knows she’s a fantastic performer.
Lmao Marcia in the corner looking like this emoji 😃
Come on Ru boldly not listening to Judge Judy and still speaking Yiddish
Not Robin in drag at Best Buy, werk bitch!!!
AURA'S MOM WENT IN
Was Salina just yawning?  ![gif](giphy|NGPZlKXBWBu958ln5v)
Not using ballroom culture to sell Burger King. Did Aja approve this??
Fuck some of these reads were good.
SUGAR WITH A 2-FOR-1
why was that funnier than the real reading challenge
LOOSEY  ![gif](giphy|C7jNVT8CMDTbWnTCKi)
As a gap-toothed gal myself, right on Luxx 🤩
Malaysia is such a sweetheart, she’s warming my heart so much rn
Why are they only using Jax for her reaction shots?? Let. Her. Speak
THE FAMILY HEIRLOOM BYE
OMG MADDYYYY
Salina's life is flashing before her eyes
Jax had the worst outfit but they knew Salina was a powder keg and gave her the award
Sasha and Anetra have gotten barely any screentime
what the fuck was that sneezs
Irene is getting a lot of screen time on this reunion!!
My home state doing us proud! Go CT!
Come through Connecticut.   Proud of my home state!
Well shit looks like I’m moving to Connecticut
Connecticut vs the World bitchhhhhh
Connecticut doing what FL can't rn. at least one state has it together
Go season of Connecticut!!!  Next season, I want a bunch of queens from Maine or Montana
Irene putting in the work
Anetra, a bitch that Tae Kwon Does the most <3
I don't know if I smoked too much, but rus eyes while she's laughing is killing me.
Oh I love this footage, Sasha looks amazing
But come on, Sasha's motherfucking musicality is otherworldly
Sasha is winning for sure lol
Aww the pics at the end 😔
Irene is so funny and quick, she has to come back
MTV entering the infinite commercial era
Marcia was definitely better in the Snatch Game.
This is literally the Mistress show
This is the Mistress Isabelle Brooks reunion featuring the cast of Season 15
Not Aura flirting with Poppy and then announcing an engagement  ![gif](giphy|RjZKyL6VejXwiK9w5a)
![gif](giphy|HRz44Z2pmFfjO)  Salina is doing Chi-Chi Rodriguez and I think she's doing it well 🤷🏼
Salina looked so annoyed by that comment hahhaha
Salina seems over it this whole reunion
I just don’t, in my opinion, get why everyone eats up every tiny thing Irene does.
For all the shit Irene is dishing, they should really bring up her ‘making ice water’ skit
I actually believe they shouldve this political conversation earlier in the show. Lots of people checkout after a while.   But its so good theyre leaning into this. All the people at home enjoy queer art, and they should be active allies
Sasha got those coco eyes 👁️👄👁️
Oh MIB fucking lied
not calling out Loosey while she's sobbing about inclusivity
Luxx saying “i block them” after her Twitter rant
Unseen footage of Mistresses adlibs rly make her win make even more sense
Getting slowly upset that we missed all these clips because of fucking Fraudrick. I can't
Ending the reunion with an outpouring of praise for Sasha feels correct
Has Jaxx said one word?
Poppy's look is iconic
Irene looks amazing
FIFTY SEVEN MINUTES? Their poor mother
I really want to see Irene on a full season
Go to bed at 8pm era, Ru gets it!!!!!
One degree of Kevin Bacon
The minute any single former drag race queen is shown on this show I get so emotional
THE TWINS MADE ME LAUGH ?!?
This is a very congenial reunion  I want more  ![gif](giphy|DkLhjxi5em1qw)
Malaysia’s wig is so good
Sasha trying to figure out how to deny it but she couldn’t. 😆
NOT MAMA FIERCE CALLING MIB OUT 💀💀💀
Loosey will not snap back like cmon *READ THE BITCH*
The lighting for these Vegas girls is homophonic
Are Sugar and Spice cosplaying as Lizzie McGuire/Isabella?
Have a blessed night, that’s that southern “niceness”
When the moms bring more drama than the queens did
OH MY GOD finally getting some extra reads!!
What’s with Salina and Irene?
Luxx didn't take that hat off all season tho
Withered
Anetra being all of us 💖
ANNA DELVEY STANS RISE UP
Trying to make up for everything cut out of the 60 minute airing slots
I want Jinkx to star in every commercial.
I just noticed Amethysts racoon
Thank god there were so many people speaking during the Nashville segment
NOT ME CRYING AT THIS CONNECTICUT VIDEO
Connecticut gays maybe small but they are mighty
I love RuPaul wheeze laughing
Ru as the director looking like Charles Nelson Reilly up in here.
The director was the lucky one that day
![gif](giphy|cFgb5p5e1My3K)  Aja watching the vogue discussion like
Luxx was right about the pregnancy look
Robin really needs to speak up or even interrupt other queens because even Poppy outshined her tonight
I dont think Luxx has ever uttered a "I'm sorry" in her entire life
Luxx:  “I didn’t take joy in answering the question”  3m prior as the recap gets shown:  Luxx smiling bigly
Not the glasscock reference
Lol Marcia’s line was great
man I'm sorry Sasha but I don't think I'll ever be a fan of those colored contacts
Salina does look like Chi Chi. Work little Latin boy in drag!
nice to see you aileen😭😭😭
I forgot how fun the twins were
WELL ITS NOT HARD FOR YOU TO IMPERSONATE A MAN
Kevin is reading off a damn script
LET LOOSE!!!!
Is Loosey serving Minions on purpose?
We were so robbed of Irene it’s painful
Malayasia said the longest lie.
Robin getting screen time?? 😍😍😍
It’s Jack Antonoff’s time!
LMAO WHAT JUST HAPPENED
I came in late and I just saw who Poppy is dressed as. That takes NERVE.  (She's dressed as Rebecca Glasscock's entrance look)
I don’t want anything for my wedding just send money to [ad read]  I mean it’s for a good cause but it was  awkward.
Oh my gosh bringing in the families for pointed questions is WILD
I’m thinking to myself “Aura and Poppy haven’t said a single word yet” right before Ru asks Aura to fess up 💀
OMG WAIT ROBIN WENT TO WORK LIKE THAT
why was Aquaria emoting so much lmao
Also aura’s mom ate
I *love* the mom’s revenge, this should be worked in to every reunion somehow
"Are you speaking English?" stoooop
Spice sounded like she was doing Twin Speak by herself.
Some of these reads are better than the ones that made it to air
Robin catching strays!
I’m an old ass bitch I’m Joey Jay
I feel like my old ears need UN headphones to understand the twins
I mean you knew it was gonna be the lamppost look. Nothing was worse.
They chose the correct bottom 3
The minute Bob shit on this look for Watchery, that's when we should've known...not even Jax's hideous tie-dye look was winning Golden Boot
This Pink Ladies show looks awful..
ARIANNA?
Omg a call out! Hi gayyyys
Michelle said WAAUGHHH
Connecticut's Next Drag Superstars: Robin, Amethyst, Loosey and Jax
Anetra Baby arms Mcgee
PRISSYKRISNIS
Robin just doesn't exist, does she?
How did I just realize at 9:57 MIB's look is based on her confessional look?!!
![gif](giphy|2DtKnzH3nRX7wXweNe|downsized)
Rupaul: "I'm unbothered by what people say"  Courtney and Pearl: You sure about that?
Sasha being verrrry quiet so far 👀 It’s giving “Sasha Velour knowing she just smashed the finale” vibes  Edit: “knowing you’re GOING TO smash the finale” vibes 🤭
Loosey seems kinda nervous but I would b too if I watched a season of everything I said being cut out of context 😫
Ru’s “okay” after Sasha didn’t name her as her favorite drag queen sounded very pointed.
Irene jumping in is so awkward 😭
Luxx’s thesis defense 😍
Luxx’s dissertation lives rent free in my (and Loosey’s) head
Anetra say something challenge
Are we not going to ask Salina about telling Ross to eat her ass omg
Mistress straight up telling him they all want to fuck him ~~(except her, she'd just give him head.)~~ 🤣🤣🤣
viacom really trying to make drew barrymore happen huh
Sasha is the ambassador we need
I LOVE IRENE LYING TO MAKE DRAMA ON PURPOSE
my mom asked why she can't be as confident as luxx ): yall i was already crying about connecticut now my mom is making me sad
damn I was really hoping they addressed Anetra vs Aja especially after the last episode where Anetra professed her love for ballroom and voguing     I might be reading too much into it but her blocking and not engaging with Aja is probably a way to still hold ballroom dear to her heart without having that negative interaction with Aja blemish it. She could also just be a mature ass ho idk 👁️👄👁️
*Aja has left the chat*
They edited out so many good parts from Mistress acting challenge
Yeah, sashas winning.
Anetra vs Sasha lip synch for the win
The episode ending on Sasha Colby as it should be
The real housewives intro is A+ lol
“I May have gone home first, but I’m also a bitch” 💀
Lizzie McGuire omg my heart
Glasscock!!
Poppy had me screaming omg
This season has been so long I forgot half of the challenges
Not those 10 seconds making me cry
Holy shit Sugar's makeup looks really good tonight
If you're not wearing nails...you're still doing drag
Irene looks AMAZING
god Marcia is so adorable
Loosey getting her flowers before they crush her spirit
# LET LOOSE
Aww I’m happy for Loosey getting the Kevin Bacon stamp of approval
It’s time to let loose
Is Sasha wearing what she wore at her lip sync tonight
“Do a trick, pony” yikes
I just need to say that Malaysia looks absolutely amazing tonight
Malaysia def looks AMAZING in this pink, and this hair? 😝
I feel like they're all trying to be extra sweet to avoid the wrath of the various online fan bases
Jax Robyn and Poppy haven't said anything yet
Jax won that.
NOT ROBIN’S MOM COMING FOR MISTRESS LMFAOO
Amethyst letting goddess Robin Fierce get away 🙄
Please welcome to the stage, Rhonda Fierce!
Hacked 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
MOMS WITH QUESTIONS, PRODUCTION IS GOING TO *HELL*
Why are they sending the mothers after these girls!!!! Dying
$200,000 prize for “working at best buy in full drag” generously provided by CashApp RIGHT NOW PLEASE
OH my god they're about to address the covid thing lol  for the record I believe Poppy when she said recently that she didn't even actually do the chapstick thing. Some people are saying she's backtracking, but I think she wanted to seem like a cool and edgy queen at Roscoe's so she just kinda hail mary'd a fake story thinking it would hit and it missed hard
it’s just one gap 😭😭😭
Ah yes a reminder of the cursed shortened episodes
Okay, Malaysia, we love to see this self awareness!
The Gate breakdown is sending me. Again this is my Superbowl and I'm gonna need a play by play
I can’t get over Luxx’s beat
Damn I busted out the guac late in the game, but it's here now and it's delicious
If Selina doesn't get the Golden Boot...
Irene about to body the unseen queen looks category
Malaysia so quick with the comebacks lol
This isn’t a fart, it’s a fluff  Pardon?
SALINA IS TERRIFIED HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Robin is so beautiful.
MADDYYYYY
Oh who was that pit crew member? Asking for a friend.
Lmao the ted talk
That sneeze?! 😆
As a redditor i feel so seen 😢
Yessss robin 👏
#brushitofftheback
Ru's creeping in on her Star Trek era
Ru loved that duck.
Selina giving her best lip sync of the season during this segment
Love all this unseen footage
Oh I’m wet
This was basically the Mistress Isabelle Brooks show, and I lived for it
The twins and MIB are stealing the show here. Ru seems to like them quite a bit.
Loosey girl pls fight back, why is she letting her self get dog walked again
Is Selina okay? She seems so bummed
I don't get what Luxx said either. What was that?
I will never ever ever get tired of that fucking talent show
Ending on Sasha again! Winner.
#TeamSasha
She finally got her second win --  Mistress Isabelle "Reunion Winner" Brooks 🫶  ![gif](giphy|RnoRQDcJXBQTvg99ig)
I did see a lot of people comment that Salina had a blaccent so I dont think Irene was wrong for that.........
I’m entering my separation anxiety era once this season ends in a few weeks… :/
![gif](giphy|J1G7rIvoyz4cwaqXWo|downsized)
Thank god for mistress and the twins cause everyone else is in their congenial eras
Irene’s getting a lot more airtime than some of the other queens who were there all season.
Omg i’m living for Loosey clapping back.
Okay this reunion is great but it's looooooooong
i wish amethyst was better this season. she’s really funny
Omg Anetra as Doonese (?) would have been amazing!  ![gif](giphy|3o7TKEPO1bjPaOtGSc)
Ru is unbothered, until you mention sweatpants
So Sasha’s winning….?
god I love that giggle they do   **TEEheeHeeHEEheEHeeheeHeEhEEHEeHE**
Good evening!  So who do we think is winning the- well we know who let me rephrase  Which of Salina's looks is winning the golden boot?
What in the Real Housewives taglines
Irene cracks me the fuck up
They need to keep this Housewives tagline bit, this is great
Love that all the girls had one more prepared tag line 😂
\#FreeWilly
Ru was not kidding about that bill
Someone took Salina's light bulb from her street lamp look. The homophobia is real y'all
Is Sugar and Spice’s look based on the Lizzie McGuire movie?????
i missed the twins together and their bits
Go to bed at 8pm era. Ru speaking to us olds out here.
Screen time era 💀
poppy is ready to just go tf home at this point
Loosey's smile watching herself back looks so forced.
SHOUTOUT to bfedrag, dragracefantasia, dragnexus and all the bitches making stats about the show on IG
I can't stop staring at Mistress's rogue nipple
KEVIN BACON?? Loosey’s one degree separated now!
Did they edit out Robin’s response?! This is wild haha
Is this really 2 hours? I don’t know how they’re gonna fill that much time
LET LOOSE I SAID LET LOOSE
Loosey cannot let loose
LET LOOOOOOOOOOOOOSE, I SAID LET LOOSE
I hate that Amazon commercial
Marcia looks damn good
I liked how Ru asked Marcia what happened out there like a sports reporter!! This is MY Superbowl bitch!! Lol
ru be on Reddit getting our tea, we been knew
Sasha is just sitting and chillin, that’s either a very good sign or a very bad sign of things to come
Thank you Salina for joining in with that cackle, I've missed it
Salina looks like she’s wearing a mask and that wig is not it
Omg they actually let Jax speak
Poppy?! I thought Aura wanted to fuck Jax
wait the message from the queen’s family members asking the questions i lOVE THAT
I’m sorry was Poppy’s only line on the reunion so far about the size of their dick?
Ok robin’s Best Buy story is very endearing
Aura's mother is out for blood
I'm gonna start using my eras to excuse my insults
I did not come to this reunion to relive my pandemic PTSD
Can QCare+ release a new ad? I can quote that entire ad after this season
“getting my twinks mixed up”
I cannot believe that Todrick deprived us of these reads
Spice...you need some!
THANK YOU MALAYSIA
Sasha’s face when Loosey brought up Mistress when she wasn’t even involved in the question …
I wish Luxx had the 32-35 inch rounded to 40 wig so we could see the measuring live.
Golden Boot is definitely Ms EsTitties 😔
i feel like salina def has worse looks on this season alone. they should give her a cash prize for some new looks!
How did MTV give us *those* 1 hour episodes and then make this amazing reunion
Ope, time to BeReal
"I had to go to jail dressed like Liza Minelli"  Gurl, same.
Get it Connecticut!
absLOOSEly not
Loosey <3
PLEASE PLAY MUSIC THE SILENCE IS AWFUL
Wait what's pretty kiss?
Anyone feel like the twins look different in the face now?
Why are we all Salina right now?
Luxx’s wig is so cute
Omg Rus laugh face is scarier than Skinamarink
once you know me you're never gonna NOT KNOW ME HONEY
That verse is still everything
Loosey getting dragged when she's going to make more money on Let Loose than any of these hoes make from their shit.
I don’t care who gets the crown. Mistress really won the season. I’m sure she’ll be back for allstars stat.
A sugar tangent in a stand up comedy challenge was something we never got to see bc it would have been too iconic
Mistress is still out for loosey 💀💀
Lmao I love how this is basically Irene’s audition tape for another season
Salina is ready to go home
Salina is starring daggers into the back of Loosey’s head.
Ru turned to MIB and said, “hey can you salvage the last 4 minutes of awkward ass footage?”
MISTRESS MAKING ORVILLE BLUSH SLAY
this jinkx monsoon bubbly commercial sends me every time because it really is straight out a drag race challenge
Irene taking over this reunion with one whole episode HOW
Sasha fucking crushed that. I was definitely seduced.
THE TROT IS BACK
I missed the twins. Such a breath of fun, dumb fresh air
Irene is not as good at reading as I...hoped
“Ok white girl”
I think Irene is just….maybe not great in drag race format for anything
very confused why mistress is “going too far and being a bitch” but y’all are living for everything irene says  edit: especially when irene was the only one who got a visibly annoyed reaction with the “fake accent” comment. while mistress is just having fun
LOOSEY GET HERRRR (I love Luxx but I’ve been dying to see Loosey let LOOSE)
Yess Loosey is about to get LOOSE finally!
NOT THE SAME WIG FROM A PUPPET
Luxx is MEAN but she's great TV tbh
Luxx was saying Loosey is being very exceptional at being generic, and she thought she was in her congenial era.
Mistress Isabelle Brooks needs to be the next Pit Stop host. Fuck All-Stars we need that to happen
OOP SHE SAID IT. Louder Mistress, from the mountaintop
Mistress is eating this episode up!
I don't have a problem with Luxx, but telling an artist that their work is generic feels very intentional. You could easily say it's just not your taste and move on
This is the Mistress reunion show
I bet the twins were expecting to explain the dolls they're carrying and the editors are like "yeah no".
Aura missed her reign as cringe queen
Hahahahhahahahahaha GET HER LOOSEY
Mistress will be under Loosey's skin more than moisturizing lotion
Drag her, Loosey
Luxx’s TED talk on how to bring Loosey Down “unintentionally” will never not be funny.
The Luxxgina Monologues
this is so AWKWARD
Imagine this reunion without mistress lol
oh Loosey :(
On a side note, has Ru’s head always been so pointy?
Cannot wait for the reunion to start  ![gif](giphy|y7Yhe5hAoSVRS)
Who’s ready for two hours of the queens against Loosey?  ![gif](giphy|tyqcJoNjNv0Fq|downsized)
Marica quote 🤣
Same Marcia
Fine. I LOVE these Housewives taglines. Let's have them every year!
marcia in her best look yet let's go
Didn't realize Sasha's eyes could look any crazier. And then everything changed when the blue eye contacts fire nation attacked
Gonna miss this cast😭
a lightbulb?? 😭
Sugar & Spice fucking up Snatch Game royally was iconic...in all the derogatory ways but it did lead to one of the best stunts in a lipsync ever.
What’s the under over for how many words Robin says tonight
I kind of missed the twins
A chihuahua OR a Rottweiler lmao
"Eeeera"
Ru was so real for the going to bed at 8 PM bit
They should do an All Stars season featuring all those queens eliminated first
I almost forgot how much they wanted to be second.
"That's *MY* verbiage" is STILL one of the best lines of the season
Marcia really just happy to be there
these girls were really walking off stage and going “first is the worst second is the best” like please 😭😭
Omg the Kevin Bacon message to Loosey!!
Kevin bacon Omg
ROBIN STILL BEING TREATED LIKE THE MIDDLE CHILD IS SENDING MEEEE😭😭😭😭😭💀
I can’t wait to see so many of these girls on All Stars. I don’t care how delusional she is or I am, I’m such a Loosey stan at this point
Anetra is my favorite but I don't think hot pink is her color.
Irene DuBois you’re all of us
Salina!!!! My shit starter
*Scissor Sistas*
You can even see the look on their faces that they’re just not into talking about this again
ROBYN'S MOM OMG THIS IS WILD
I'm happy for Aura, but the timing was so freakin weird. I know the show was filmed a bit ago, so obviously that's time to get engaged, but the ad placement was so strange too. Aura just seemed a bit nervous and embarrassed ):
Not Coco coming for Marcia's makeup with that nose
DeJa with the All Stars level up
“Thank you for that” werk
Derrick look a mess
ru said loosey you are NOT getting out of this question
not them having the moms read out reads looool
poppy quit drag and has nothing to fucking lose anymore
They still trying to make Loosey crack into pieces
Has Salina said anything at all?
KURT LODER?????? Wow what a blast from the past
"It's only one gap"
YASSS Sugar! 😂
POPPY
SUGAR 😭😭
Salinaaaaa is done!
Sasha needs a break to powder her face
Jax’s makeup looks great
Where was Irene keeping that tape measure? She came prepared!
we need two golden boots, one for jax’s slime green whatever, and salina’s lovely streetlamp couture !!
I’m not convinced Spice is speaking English
Salina is not feeling it. She knows. She knows.
The terror on Salina’s face
Not the box hair dye !
Damn nothing nice about Salina before the boot😭
A well earned award.
this is so fun.  Of all the casts to have everyone go home on schedule, they picked this one with great chemistry and people who can dish and take it where I'd actually have liked a fuller room longer
Finally some good fucking food
Ru loves a good poop joke
Michelle expelled a demon with that
Yes Robin Woods!
Did they even show Robin’s face in that Connecticut taped bit? Jax looked unphased haha
Why are we talking about whether Irene did or didn’t get filler?  What a silly topic lol
Such a talented cast. My favorite season (nit counting all stars) in a long time
Salina taking it personally agaaain.
So mistress definitely lied lmao
Luxx made PANTS. out of an ugly rug of zebra print. Werk bitch
Mistress carried this episode I LOVE THIS QUEEN
I'm still mad about the 200th episode having a Lil Nas X song as the lipsync. IT'S YOUR SHOW, RU. USE ONE OF YOUR FUCKING SONGS.
How do I remember barely half of these moments, was I catapulted into another dimension?
I feel like the social media response has definitely pushed Loosey and Luxx to both not speak on anything and it’s really sad. Sasha and Mistress noticeably stepped in to redirect Ru and it was nice to see the unity there.
MISTRESS IS CARRYINGGGG
Mistress must be so tired from carrying this reunion
Yikes Irene
Malaysia’s mug looks gorge
Oop MIB cut Irene off QUICK
Sasha has barely talked. Wow
mistress is that GIRL and she spoke real to mr peck
Sasha is truly mother
oh they’re addressing EVERYTHING
Sasha is effortlessly amazing
Nah Mistress genuinely doesn’t like Loosey like her cuntness to her is so targeted and doesn’t give “fun read” vibes
Now Luxx, the revisionist history girl
Mistress really is a star. She could probably make a conversation with a broom be entertaining.
This top 4 really was such a serve. All of them deserve a crown but regardless, this is Sasha’s season and anyone else winning would feel really anticlimactic imo
I can’t get over Mistress’s mug tonight truly in her stamped era
Gosh I really want to see Irene again on a season. Main, All Stars, I’m not picky.
I like Mistress but we’ll see her in the finale! Let’s spread out the screen time
loosens face after MIB said that to her
Jesus H Christ, Poppy is a full on agent of chaos
Imma need Loosey to read Mistress at least one good time tonight. Home girl has it in her
oof without MIB this would have been very boring
Ireeeeeennneeeee is on my screeeeeen
These taglines are awful, give us more
We get the alphabetical order realness
Not Sugar and Spice being put together 😭
THE LIZZIE MCGUIRE REPRESENTATION
Of all the things to steal I didn’t expect a lightbulb
Omg my mind had already forgotten the hammer and now it’s back 😭
Ru giggling at the twins lool
Does anyone else think Sugar kind of looks like Derrick Barry?
The twins are proving the lighter makeup after drag race theory
I'm entering my Era-era. And I won't be leaving anytime soon
Kornbread having cans instead of curlers in her hair in this Olay commercial will never stop making me laugh
Living for Irene!
Bitch, those House of Love cocktails look about as strong as a 1 pound weight
LET ROBIN SAY SOMETHING 😭
I can see MIB’s whole left nipple
KEVIN BACON WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE
Not them only talking ti amethyst & Robin in relation to loosey 💀
Kevin Thee Bacon??
Let Loose - we have Hollywood royalty approval
Omg Kurt Loder on this yellowjackets promo
Marcia’s such a theatre kid bc u rly take critiques and keeping them in mind at all times
Im really enjoying Irene’s high quality screen time! I hope they ask her back!
LUXXXXXXX
Salina’s hair and makeup is roughhh
Not this..,.
I would have had the biggest crush on Amethyst in middle school lol
Irene is giving it all. Love it
I am living for Poppy’s 2002 look
 not robins moms getting more screen time than her 🫣
Asia! Good question too.
Asia!! 😍 miss her on my screen
THE BEST BUY PICTURE
THE BEST BUY PICTURES
Not going to work in drag lmao, that’s so camp
Sugar looks so beautiful
Daaaaaang Mama Robin is pretty
I love how you can tell the producers wrote these questions
Rhonda for Season 16
No one believes you, Loosey. Just embrace it!
oh these moms are shadyyy
Aura’s mom speaking facts
These moms are a vibe!
I need to know how Aja feels about this Burger King ballroom commercial
not this ballroom burger king commercial 😭😭😭😭
oh poppy... this preview aint making you look good 😭
Salina was good too!
Am I the only one that felt RuPaul expected Sasha to name her as her favorite drag queen?
We get to see the lost footage?? I'm officially eating
Michelle's catching strays
Did Ru just slip into an exaggerated southern accent for half a sentence?
RuPaul is living
Finally we’re addressing the 40inchs….
The tape measure! She has props!!!!
No change anything but Salina’s lamp or Jax’s tie dye get the Golden Boot
Why are they actually giving us what we wanted?? Is this an apology for the beginning of the season butchery??
Salina looks scared af rn
Salina please don’t get upset 🙏🏻
Hahaha yas Salina!!! Golden boot!!
LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO WE KNEW IT. Also, the SuperJew pit crew one with longer hair, yummy
JINNNNKXKKXKXXXXX
YAS CT! I’ve lived here my whole life
I just teared up a bit LOL
Yes mother!
Luxx, you wanted screen time. Just say it. For someone always complaining about people who don't say what they're thinking.
If the Reunion was a challenge, Mistress would have it on lock. She needs a show, stat.
Mistress has a natural talent for getting under Loosey’s skin I live for it
I have to admire MIB’s laser focus on destroying Loosey’s psyche. She can read her so effortlessly. There’s gotta be more to that situation than we see.
Salina was not amused! I like Irene but those weren’t great.
Irene ate Salina up I fear
I love Mistress but I’d love for someone else to talk….
The way luxx is so unserious but ppl will still try to make it into something.
Irene will definitely be on all stars
Kind of getting burnt out by this Mistress and Irene reunion
Sasha and Anetra barely talking makes me believe they are the Top 2. As well, most people expect.
I still can't believe Danny THEE Trejo was on this stupid fucking show
Anetra and Sasha are very quiet. Definitely getting top 2 vibes here.
Give Mistress a producer credit at this point lmao
Oh, Mistress said it.
True Life: I'm Addicted to gifs  ![gif](giphy|2wrCEs4kgstg2QWAr9)
Here's an idea: Season 16, we have Kornbread *and* Irene return
sasha is in her white walker era 🥏🫦🥏
"No not this I'm embarrassed" Aura you asked the question lmao
Mistress is commanding this reunion but I guess she was involved in almost everything that happened
Irene...
Ru rolling her eyes when Irene started talking about the wig and ending up cackling will hopefully make her consider inviting her back.
I think all the nominees for the golden boot are actually interesting looks at least with some thought behind them, even if they are chaotic.
didn’t Raja and Raven toot Salina’s street signs? justice for my girl
Malaysia is the prettiest queen this season imo
Anetra was going to be Dooneese?? Crown her!
No AS8 promo teaser yet?
I’m sorry but no one cares about a situationship between two twinks that are a shared 10.
Loosey is deranged and it only makes me love her more. I love her the way I love Marnie in Girls. Marnie doesn’t mean to be a cunt. She wants to have a sense of humor about herself but the pain is real.
Ughhh I feel like this season could've been much better had Irene lasted
Who is holding Kevin Bacon at gun point for this cameo
Jax won against MIB. Period.
call Orville my bedsheet and pillow cuz I’m ready to give him some head *and* ass 👀
I don’t get why ppl praise MIB for traditional drag and dog Loosey for her style??
I will die on this hill. Sugar and Spice are great.
Luxx: You said I messed up the choreography, and all I did was mess up the choreography. how dare you.
Irene just makes me cringe every time she talks
loosey about to let loose on luxx
Why would Luxx doing "bad" in rehearsal matter if she did good in the challenge 💀
wow I love the Mistress show 😍😍
Loving all the love for Robin
Thank god for JetBlue having stable enough Wi-Fi for me to watch the reunion on my flight lmao
What is everyone having tonight?? I've got my Scented Stretch cocktail ready and my vape is as hot as Sasha Colby's pussy.
Loving this Real Housewives of Drag Race intros lol
Sasha’s tagline was great
Holy shit, look at Irene!
These intros are better than some of the entrances on Day 1
LOOSEY IS THE NEW WINNING
Sasha's gown looks like her LalaParooza outfit but with a skirt on it. Am I wrong?
The Twins makeup looks so good
Sugar and spice with their matching dolls. I love them so much
Sugar and Spice with matching dolls I can’t
The obsession of being 2nd this season girl....
Wow my mom called me as the commercials started and we just hung up…still commercials
FINALLY SASHA SPEAKS 👏
KEVIN BACON?!
Kevin Bacon is the winner of season 15
Oh hey sis! It’s Amethyst
LET LOOOOOOOSE
Watching on Philo, SO many commercials 😭
I hope when they talk about crushes it’s just everyone telling Sasha how hot she is tbh
My v gay cat and I are living in my mother's basement 🤦🏼 he's not clicking with my mom's cats so when I'm upstairs hanging out with my mom I find myself saying to my cat *Hutch, why are you down there? Girl, you better get up and let loose!*
The halftime show is for us 😂
anetra was only in two of the best lipsyncs of the season 🤔 how about five of the best
you GOTS to get that leg in the air!!
Damn Loosey was gagged
Just say, "Bitch, I'm a motherfucking Brooks-Davenport. 1980s pop music is what we learn in our first pair of heels"
I'm all for ANY Robin screen time but nobody gives a shit about this fake nothing drama lmao
I’m in love with Jax’s drip 🖤🖤🖤
love how it’s so silent, I didn’t know it was only 5 girls on the season!!!!
Honestly forgot about Amethyst and Robin
Aura/Poppy? Didn’t see that coming
Rhonda Fierce for S16
This isn’t a marriage it’s a ✨mirage✨
I love Aquaria so much
Aquaria’s makeup… 😭😭😭
Please tell me there is actually some drama this reunion
I love Robin’s mom.
What did spice say? 🤣🤣
Not bringing up Covid
The “hot and bored girlies”
Did they forget about Anetra? She said 3 words and been silent since
SUGARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
thanks todrick
OMG 😂😂
A book?
This is a pretty chill and fun reunion, I'm enjoying, I'm entertained
What was poppy’s read about aura?
Finally we're getting to the good bits of the season 🍿
THAT STUPID ALLEGED 40 INCH WIG
Show us the measuring COWARDS!!
Oh im so glad they're showcasing the unseen looks from the eliminated queens omg
That Beyoncé look omg
That Aura look really is incredible.
Robin has more screentime, werk
Bringing out Salina's trauma today
Salina lmao omg
[Ariana where are youuuuu?](https://media.tenor.com/z8CuLAOg8ocAAAAC/duck-cute.gif)
Why isn't this on WOW Presents+ yet?  ![gif](giphy|H7fmYse9pog0iSBe8n|downsized)
These country girls are doing what Shania, Reba and Dolly did <3
i know that’s right !!!! they ate that!!
I’m coming out today to say in my OPINION I didn’t hate the street lamp look
Luxx really had one of the best design challenge looks every, it’s exquisite
Princess Poppy bringing back jeans and a nice blouse, we love to see it
MIB is showing nip 🙀
Ru LOVES Luxx
We're 30 mins in I'm ready for some fighting
Sasha has that pre-finale confidence à la Sasha Velour
SO distracted by mistress's nip letting loose
Mistress acting like she's in her angelic era right now...giiiirl
loosely with the extra lmao reads I love her
…did Irene just have that tape measure?
Not a family heirloom
Gonna call it now, if Irene comes back she’s gonna use the tape measure as her shtick the whole season lmao
Salina looks pressed.
"Have a blessed night, as will I." - Mistress Isabelle Brooks, giving a bitch BROOKS-DAVENPORT level classy shade now twice, 2023 airdate
Loosey ain’t wrong!
Ok so I feel like Irene is coming back a la Vanjie. She’s still got more screen time than Robin, and her look is pretty cunt.
Awww I’m sad Loosey’s feelings were hurt
Come at me all you want: I’m not digging Irene at all
Loosey has a right to be offended but I still feel like Luxx’s glove look regardless of the wig she wore was still way more interesting than anything Loosey wore this season
Does anyone think that Sasha is feeling off throughout the whole thing? Is she high?
I just can’t get over how fucking FUNNY MIB is. One of the most naturally funny queens from the show in my opinion.
honestly, crown Mistress for being the entertaintment of the season
Mistress has tried to call out Loosey a few times on being fake but the convo just doesn’t go there. Loosey is fully in her media training miss America era even tho her eyes say otherwise. Sorry to say a very bland reunion.
Honestly already sick of Irene
"I'm not a mean or malicious person."  Sure jan.
Luxx and Mistress just embody that old school drag race energy and I live for it
Poppy looks like she’s from MadTV
This really is Mistress’s Drag Race 😂
Girl, Salina's make up tonight   I'm not going to give an opinion on it I'm just going to bring attention to it
Malaysia does not need to apologize
Mistress is so fucking funny
The way i don't recognize half the queens
Mistress’ chest plate nipple is staring me down
When we getting the fist fight……  ![gif](giphy|26his5i9YJTqsqCyY)
Mistress was correct, Robins wig was so bad omg
Ariana looking around like  "Did y'all see that?  Did that just happen?"
Happy reunion, sluts!
Hope everyone is ready!!
Hello hello hello, everyone!
#HI GAY PEOPLE!  Welcome to Reunited, or when Drag Race takes over! YEAHH!
Just to fuck with people, I'm #TeamTheHilariousRossMatthews
I don't remember who half of these queens are lmao
Alphabetical order huh
No line sounds more scripted than "Most girls follow the script. I flip it"
Lmao Poppy 😂
Irene 😂
Cmon ~~all stars 2~~ season 15! Let’s get this… over with.
I JUST got home from a long ass day of work, I've got some chinese food, I've got some TEA, I've got Xbox Game Pass on another screen, and I'm about to get *otherworldly* comfy and watch these bitches fight for 2 hours, holy fuck I'm so READY
Time to Let Loose
Poppy lol
Not me forgetting some of these people
Sasha kinda looking like a young Vanessa Williams or is it just me?
robin looks fucking fierce omg
Malaysia and Salina look great too, and obviously Sasha is sexy as hell.
Screen time era love it
This dog commercial 🥺🥺🥺
These commercials are commercialling
Ooh now we getting into it
Loosey does look Gorgina George
Kevin motherfucking Bacon, bitches
If it wasnt Kevin Bacon I would have thought that was phoned in.
Yes Loosey, we don’t need you splaining the Kevin Bacon connection
Robin is wearing a version of Robyn Dixon’s Potomac reunion wig from a few years ago
“like ten more minutes”
I am in love with Irene
Malaysia’s makeup has gotten so much better!
Jaxx looks so good!!!
jax is so gorggg
That Little Mermaid look was so gaggy my god
“Speaking of Love”  *Amethyst and Robin look directly into the camera, looking over it*
Damn Robyn and Amethyst are rly feeling their emotions yikes
Asia!!! I miss seeing her smile light up my tv screen each week
Sasha not saying Ru Paul the crown is fading girl!!!
Poppy with the better callback to previous dragrace seasons than any of Luxx's callbacks.
Marcia x3 makeup line??
Deja with the full introduction omg
Why can’t my local best buy have someone arrive in drag. Hell I’ll take someone in Walmart electronics.
Yesssss love Sasha for giving Miss Monica her flowers ❤️❤️❤️
Best buy goddess
AQUARIA !! <3
LMAOO Best Buy era
Robin giving Best Buy realness!!!!
Loosey skirting the question
![gif](giphy|OnIkHUzH7C5OO4OREI)  When we getting to the good part….
Say their names Loosey!!
She was right lmao
I wanted more moms!
Not the Rona! 🙀
Omg that shot of Salina looks like Liza Minelli got in a car accident.
Poppy COVID tease 😭💀
Spice better deflect that fucking question lmao
is anyone elses tv stuck on this lume commercial
Does MTV know who's watching the show?  These ads are ... a look
STDs’ reads were 🤌
Anyone in Canada able to watch this cus y'all I am refreshing my crave like a madman
Salina better get it
Welcome to Lingo!
I love how the Red Panda movie is helping normalize periods in media. Very cool
Oh fucking work Aura
idk what Spice is saying or means lol
Irene really hates getting complimented
If it’s not Salina…
salina 😭😭😭😭😭
WHY IS EVERYINE SAYING ARIANA GRANDE STOP PLAYING W ME
was sadly forced to go to a family dinner instead of staying home and watching drag race 🙄 will be starting the reunion now 🙏
ok where'd they get that red velvet blazer though I need it
YESS TELL IT
The unseen deliberations
oh my god no one cares about the guests
I still want to see Orville’s pecker
Luxx quoting herself is glorious.
Not the same people living for Irene being “cunty”, but Luxx and MIB are bullies. And this tired of excuse of “it’s not about race” is bull shit. Acknowledge you may have bias. Because why does this happen every single season!
It really is a shame we didn't get more Irene this season, she's delivering great in this reunion and was only in one episode.
This should've been a confessional montage of Mistress, because Daytona Wind was cute but the confessionals...honey that's when she became Miss Congeni-gaslight
It’s Gonna be the mistress Isabelle brooks show  ![gif](giphy|MkWshfGFooxwLO0VJ7)
The twins are honestly so great
Irene looks like a football player
Not them censoring jasmines and Nina’s TikTok’s
Cashapp ads after the owner got stabbed? - MTV,  gurl, time and place.
Why are Mistress’s nipples bigger than my girl ones
I figured it out. Princess Poppy looks like Nicole Paige Brooks  Edit: I get it I was wrong! It's been several years since I've watched season one sorry!
These younglings not knowing Poppy’s reference is killing me 😭
Irene needs to come back
Ru LOVES Mistress
The Luxx dissertation 💀
CALL OUT THE PERFORMERS WHO HAVE PROFITED ON DRAG BUT HAVE NOT SHOWN SUPPORT
ok spice was serving in daytona winds
Luxx needs to own up to the fact her monologue was completely unnecessary
I missed the twins so much omg. I love so many of these girls on the cast 🥹
Yenta? Ru wants to be Jewish so bad lol
Loosey being that strong n wrong with an MTV VMAs moment like BEYONCE PERFORMING "Love on Top"...chile
Yes Irene make Ru laugh and earn your place in the next season!!! Plzzzz
Is that what Loosey understands generic to mean or did Luxx actually say that at some point?
Get out and vote y’all. Voter apathy is killer.
MIB and Loosey both said it I bet. But MIB wanted to be extra shady and told Irene that Loosey was the sole one.
Okay I'm back to thinking Sasha still has a chance. I think I'm just reading too much into it. I also read a comment making me remember how Willow really wasn't featured last reunion.
I miss the season 9 reunion.
TEAM SASHA!
For the record, what Mistress just said is directed at all of you who commented on every single post about how "Luxx and MIB are bullies"
I'd be happy if they just let Mistress talk for the whole 2 hours.
Sasha Colby doing her best to add value to that worthless shit called "Blame It On the Edit", legendtinta shit
Mistress: *acts bitchy*   Everyone: *awkward laugh*
And here we go...Luxx putting the DISS in dissertation with her answer. Legend shit, honestly
Bitch, she merely uttered the word generic
Here come all the sensitive fans who swear they love old drag race bashing luxx 😴😴😴
Mistress is going a little too hard for this reunion.. it’s becoming less iconic and more mean
Omg the accent read...
I implore you to not be on social media all the time
I feel bad, I forgot most of the queens lol
Mistress looks **DAMN** good
Mistress taking in Sugar & Spice as their daughters is fucking iconic in all the good ways
They just gonna let MIB run this reunion. Marcia ain’t have shit to say about her rankings
I feel like nobody has spoken beside Loosey, Luxx and Mistress
Why was i expecting everyone to admit they wanted Aura
Did they ask Aja and Leiomy about that ballroom Burgerking commercial!?!?!?!?
Love the amount of screen time Irene is getting.
Stan Sasha Colby, bitches
Salina’s rant in the nightclub is become more valid.
i'm so sick of this paramount plus commercial omfg
I just noticed that slight little cut in luxx’s liner that is so fierce
Anyone gonna ask Anetra if she farted after the kick to break the board?
I'm LIVING for Sugar and Spice's Lizzie McQuire movie looks 😭😭
Sorry I know it’s not fair but Irene needs to stop being shady unprompted bc it just doesn’t land. You were first out. Chill.
IRENE FOR SEASON 16 PLEASE
Luxx was giving Valedictorian realness
i thought this ended at 9:30…. this shits 2 hours???
I knew the other queens were living for Lux's speech. They all like the drama lol 😆
Some of these looks are looks
#GOOD FRIDAY? MORE LIKE BEST FRIDAY
Malaysia in another pastel gown....
i missed all these early out queens lol
Malaysia looks INCREDIBLE 😍😍😍😍
Oh I LOVE Salina's gown being a nod to To Wong Fu
salina’s serving betty boop realness
I am ready for this drama tonight!
this season was on the high end of good. too long, but definitely good.
5 finger discount realness
must suck to be a queen that was eliminated early (Poppy, Robin etc) they don’t have much to say about the  or even ask them LMAO
The twins little dolls of themselves are so cute
Everyone looks so good
Sasha with the "Im still here" moment
What is Loosey wearing?
Blame it on the alcohol
luxx cleared
KEVIN BACON LMAOO
Kevin Bacon! I love him.
I was a bit late to the show and missed the introductions. Just a second ago they cut to a reaction shot of Princess Poppy: and I literally thought “who the heck is she?”
Sasha’s boobs behind Anetra’s head is amazing
 Malaysia looking super kawaii tonight
Aww, Aura ❤️
Robin fierce is honestly so beautiful 🩵 need her on a future all stars, she’d win!!!
Asia and Sasha having those matching blue eyes
Asia and Sasha went to the contacts store today.
ROBIN HAS SCREENTIME NOW
her favorite signature PRODUCT!! We love it Marcia
deja skye looks so good when she isn't wearing black lipstick lol
Man, I wish we’d gotten more Robin. Stupid MTV trying to make a destination TV night
**LET LOOSE**
“Casted” ugh
Where part of the room are these Vegas queens painting for? The parking lot?
The fact that mom is talking about wigs while her daughter has that on tonight…
BK commercial that is referencing the ballroom scene??  Something something, reference to Aja here
Put Kurt Loder in more ads please and thank you
These reads are funny !!
okay but the pineapple read was good
Oop
"an oral history"??? They been knew
Come through poppy with the read!!! 🤣
Drag Race is in its Gate Era. And I'm here for it
Does Loosey actually not wear a corset? What does she use????
Irene out of drag looks ***so much*** like my former sponsor's daughter and it messes with me every time.
can someone explain Irene’s accent read to Salina because I’m still confused
Platform boot 😩
Omg my mom said the same thing Sugar 💀
Salina knows what’s coming.
YAS
Is this Dave loan bear related to drunken Ted. Cuz if so I don't think I'm gonna trust him with money
I am Ariana Grande! (Spartacus moment)
eat almonds. love well. repeat.
these sunglasses are sending me
LOL RU CALLING THEM OUT Edit: or I guess us lol
why is it the same announcer as the last commercial
Okay Mistress let's tone it down a biiit
Sugar and Spice having dolls of their outfits is so damn cute
Ooh I am NOT feeling Aquaria's makeup there.
Loosey watching her chance for All Stars disintegrating in front of her
Ok but Poppy better have SO much screen time in the next hour
Luxx was in her college graduation Era
Any queen that wants to read storybooks to children is no monster. Hell, even Xochi Mochi of Dragula fame reads storybooks to them chillruns.
Ru monetizing Mistress's words lmao
Mistress looks *stunning*
Is that Kevin Bacon? Why did I not know he's kind of hot?
This could be one of the best reunion episodes we’ve had. I’m already loving this.
Where is the drama. Love they’re cute era but gimme more fights.  Someone throw a purple wig on the floor in manufactured drama.
Will aura get any screen time tonight?
Crying at robin being basically non existent in the reunion 💀
Mistress was right about the tape though
Loosey already had a chance to read tho
Sasha is giving me Shea S9 Reunion vibes. Did this happen after the finale?
I’m not buying it
I think this is the first reunion I’ve cried during….
i love sugar and spice holding their doll equivalents
I am now having a hard time enjoying Irene's bits after she said that about Salinas accent.  is there some context to that I'm unaware of or was it just kind of racist?
Selena looks….bad….
im so glad mistress said that bc its so real (and the lowest decency) for marcia to constantly be trying to put her fans in place when they were attacking ppl. while luxx gets attacked by the loosey stans and its crickets.
Ok can we have Mistress at every reunion even for seasons she's not on.
Mistress still coming for Lucy in a way where I’m like… can you really still call this “cutting up with the girls”?
Luxx took joy in punching down and I took joy in watching it
I genuinely think Salina's outfit was worse than Jax's, and honestly worse than Lala's bag look, so it was well-deserved.
They said fuck everything else Luxx brought we're focusing only on this one look she made (which was incredible btw, but basically fuck the rest of her drag)
Can we just do Spice a solid and turn off their mic? 😬
Is mistress someone who can dish it but can’t take it?
Appreciated Irene's read of Salina. Salina's reaction was very telling
I said the same thing with metal gate. With Luxx she wanted to come off shady and fun but ended up coming off way too seriously which made her look like she was bullying
Salinas makeup is awful :/
Mistress is incapable of being genuine, but she thinks she's real because she's being shady. It's annoying because everything she does is this same "I'm just keeping it real" character.  &#x200B;  Edit: [For those of you who are mad](https://youtu.be/BaRsvoFuw7o?t=15).
Have we seen Mistress kill a lip sync? Where does her confidence come from when she’s been mid in every one she’s been in
Irene’s racist read of Salina almost as casual as Poppy’s jeans
Please I completely forgot about the twins 😭
This is so lukewarm rn
Is poppy still making covid jokes?? Yikes
I don’t usually watch reunions. Can you tell who is going to win based on reunion editing? In other words, is Anetra getting a winners edit??
Completely forgot to show one of Robins looks
filmed at drag con i guess
Mistress reading Salina for the street lamp at Roscoe’s is one of the funniest off the cuff reads I’ve seen in a minute. 😭 It’s worth looking up on YT if you haven’t seen it. In the first 20-30 minutes when Salina id talking about her runways.
Thank you Irene!
Loosey fighting hard for that miss congeniality title 😂 but fr that was sweet 💖
Mistress is EATING the girls
Eep the read from Loosey to MIB was a little too far but i love that the heels were brought up since Loosey got called out for that by the judges while others didn’t
This is basically the Mistress show. And I am here for it.
I love Luxx’s attitude, she understands the game
this is MIB’s congenial era. get into it
Mistress definitely giving that top four edit where you just stop giving a fuck and go crazy at the reunion. Tho this is just how she is regardless.
Salina getting the award she deserves. And the shade from Irene about her accent 🤭
https://media.tenor.com/HHillqtXoukAAAAC/giggling-mistress-isabelle-brooks.gif  oh Aja boutta be acting up on Twitter TONITE
Mistress a real one for calling these hypocritical fans out (half of reddit here).
TEAM MISTRESS
Loosey is so full of shit lmao
The absolute longest reunion ever. I wish it had been half as long and that time was used to give us 90 minute episodes all season. I was bored by the end. The finale better be 90 minutes or someone made a mistake.
Luxx, sweetie, communication isn't what you say:  it's how the other person experiences it.
Evening,  mes chères salopes
Happy reunion!! Missed last 2 weeks so I've been catching up, shoutout to MTV for showing reruns
Reunion time! Let’s get it
Marcia looks like a feral little child I love her
Tea time, bitches
SO EXCITED FOR THID I HOPE ITS JUICY
Let LOOSE!!!!
Who’s ready to Let Loose
These outfits are not my favorite
Jax's makeup looked so much better
We are about to be FED
I love this cast so much
They really included Marcia's embarrassing stan scream lmao
Bring back my girls is not my favorite track but it has underscored some iconic moments
Sugar, yes.  Sometimes I feel like a policeman.
It’s Era time
Oh, thought the movie was The Pope's **Enemist**  my bad
The captions are literally gibberish RN
SASSHAAAAAAA
Oh Luxx is gorgeous
my ISP is going in the middle of the green noise commercial which makes it was worse
Yes Irene, get your deserved screen time girl!
They're gonna make us wait until the end for Wiggate
THAT preview 🆘
This WTW commercial is so funny
LMAOOAOAOAOAOAOAOAO
Get her, Mizriz Fierce
Asia O’Hara! 😍
SELENA'S FACE
COCOOOOO
Omg LOVE that wig on Asia
For some reason, the way Asia presented her question reminded me of the guest questions on Big Fat Quiz, and now I want a crossover.
Ooooh werk Monica Munro...I'm gonna YouTube them once this is over
 Sasha's eyes *goddamn*
Ru was hoefended
RuPaul told Robyn to stfu with that tone
I would buy boatloads of products from Best Buy if Robin worked there. Hell I’d even finance!
Is anybody else just stopped on Lume?
What was that MTV news section
Omg green noise is filling me to the brim with rage, wtf‽
Gate Era 2nd Place season
Here for the Subaru dog commercial!
Damn  Aura 😮
I gotta say, I didn’t know Maren at all before she was on the show, but I kinda love her
Who do you all think is Miss Congeniality?
Is anyone else getting 20 kim from top notch commercials?
MIB showing the star she is! This was def the MIB & Luxx show tonight.
Poppy wearing jeans  ![gif](giphy|l0MYsNWnIu2aUi3fy|downsized)
Damn, Irene was all good til that Salina read
Luxx can go really far with her designs skills, I'm excited for future looks
loosey looks so jealous
Loosey is doing a bad job of pretending not to be bothered
How are we enjoying Mistress’ Drag Race?
Jeans and tee is a bold fashion choice
This is kinda boring. And there's still an hour and half left?
I’m living for Mistress’ peekaboo nip.
Not a fan of Poppy.
Bong hits for the last half hour, cheers 🥂
So she really did steal the book?? I'm so confused!! What's real?!?
It's aaaa meee - Star Lord.    Get off my TV you Christianist whore
Is Loosey gonna be ok?
I really was happy with how humanizing this reunion has been for Luxx and I get on here and the comments are nothing but y’all shitting on her and being rude… never change y’all
Mistress just murdered everyone damn
Mistress ate that line
Malaysia top toot of the week easily, followed by Irene
Is Sasha rewearing an outfit? That top looks similar
Mistress thee comedian
Mistress and Malaysia rly got these girls together
Loosey sounds like she’s struggling to be honest. But an A for effort.
You can tell this was filmed by the finale because mistress and luxx are being much more reserved than they actually are
Kinda wish this season had a little more drama ngl almost every season had at least one memorable fight but I can't think of one from this season
Nah i need to hear what Aura is about to say
Mistress deserved her flowers for serving in that Taylor Dayne number
When is this shit gonna get vicious? Lol
WHAGTTT AURA
poppy blocked bob on Grindr cause he was with aura CONFIRMED 😹😝
My pre-existing opinions on Loosey, Luxx, Marciax3, and the twins were only further solidified in this reunion. Read into that what you will.
The way in which Luxx handled herself at the reunion confirmed exactly what I thought about some of you all. A lot of you don’t actually dislike Luxx because of her arrogance….let’s call a spade a spade. If you feel called out by this check in with your Mom not me 😇
I roll my eyes every time Mistress does that “tee hee hee” with her hand over her mouth
Can't believe luxx isn't more popular online with how humble and likable she is.
I would love a Malaysia and MIB show
Not Irene’s racist read to Salena
…you know I was rooting for Mistress a bit heading into the finale but she’s being a bit too cunty tonight for my taste.  We get it girl you’re an old school queen…but it’s a reunion there’s no more competition let’s tone it down a little
Y'all noticed like basically no one in this reunion is apologizing for bad behavior?  No wonder this season has a weird energy.  Like there's no growth of character, which usually is a defining feature in the strongest seasons.
MIB shut the fuck up
please end this i’m tired of sitting
LOL Poppy wut
This is the dullest reunited in awhile
i assumed malaysia only picked marcia bc spice is her daughter no? that just seems obvious
Mistress's look is kind of a boot
How many times do I have to say this?? WE DONT WANT SPORTS GEAR!!!  😂
Would’ve liked the queens to talk about finding drag moms during the show.
Mistress’s hat is giving me Lucy’s stay puft marshmallow hat
Where’s the drama mama
Mistress is about to get gathered
Why does Salina’s makeup look so terrible
Guys, I’m in BR so I still can’t watch, is there a clear indication of who’s being set up to win?   A la Brooke got painted as the villain in the reunion and lost?
LMAOOOO Rhonda is sending me but MIB is sending me more
Not the mom's lol
ARIANA PLEASE DROP AN ALBUM
Ngl I'm kinda excited for the Exhibit finale. Which of these delusional artists are gonna win it all??
Will Loosey admit Luxx was right? Let’s see!
this “drama” is so STALE, we do NAWT care.
Here we go with a Queen getting kicked off super early talking half the time  Edit: for the record this was posted about 60 seconds before she said she’s in her screen time era lol
Mistress, please, we know you're good  - let other people talk.
I standby MIB shouldn’t have won the Daytona challenge. But top was good.
Yellowjackets still missing wtf is this
For those in Canada🇨🇦: Am I the only one who can’t see the reunion on Crave?
Irene’s read on Salina was spot on😭 everytime Salina talks, I cringe, especially knowing that it’s not the way she actually talks. Non black people STOP WITH THE BLACCENTS. Y’all killin me
I’m glad we have these clips of Loosey being ridiculously annoying and mean, she deserved to go home lmao
MIB CLOCK THEM
now are y'all gonna lie and say irene is being too mean  too or are y'all just mistress hating flops 🧐
Careful Mistress - Snitches Get Stiches in this house
LOLLLL IRENE’s random read on Malaysia  I cackled!

Is it wrong that I think the Liberty Mutual guy is ... sorta hot?
i love luxx sm
Need some season 9 energy. Need some season 10 energy. I NEED THE DRAMA.
Anyone watching the Pink Ladies grease prequel show??
10 more minutes♥️
is this we've heard from Spice all night?
I don’t math but I’m pretty sure that’s not how it works. 😆
Most boring fucking reunion ever. I really expected some drama, but we got NOTHING. Also, why did Sasha wear the same outfit she wore for the lip sync episode? I expected more from her, of all people.
They are giving Anetra the winner edit ;_;
Mistress shouldn’t feel bad for calling Lux and MIB bullies because they are. It’s not the end of the world that they participate in bullying but call it for what it is.
are we just getting a tour of the winners of each challenge cause zzz
I’m so excited to hear more from Sugar and Spice they are SOOOO FUNNY
not it being ENGRAINED in ur mind :sob:
Mistress isn't helping herself retain any fans  Edit: lol at downvotes... You'd think being factual was like sending a death threat.  She goes beyond normal queen shadiness, so yeah a bunch of people are put off by it.    Y'all can be fans, idc.
Ok.. “that’s why it’s so fried?“ that was racist af
What is poppy wearing tho for real
I'm in my down-with-TikTok queens era, jfc. Get these children off my TV screen and let the grown women speak!
I don't get the loosy read
What was poppy wearing?
Major Intestinal Blockage confirmed Season 16 winner.
Princess Poppy's look is...a choice
God, imagine if Marcia and Anetra were given a *good* song instead of Boss Bitch, that would've been a good moment
Hi gay happy reunion day!!
Is the reunion two hours or one??
Jujubee: "I'm *excited...*
Here we go! Love a reunion.
SASHA
holy shit the local commercial is actually local to me this time.    so. what'd i miss so far?
Wait…is that how it works?? Luxxe I dunno
Anetra’s makeup 🫣
SKSNNDNDDND
“Most definitely”
What is this 😭
Coco!!!!!!! 💖💖💖💖💖💖
Asia 😭
Deja, honey, I have a burning problem too
Are these really fan questions...
robin’s mom lmaooo
We get to see one extra read from the reading challenge. Yay?
Gaaaaag
Ahhhh i feel good baduh badu badu dum
What the fuck was that mcgruff the crime dog ad? Was that a parody or a real thing???
im surprised nothing about poppy quitting was brought up???
Irene gathered a bit... though it isn't quite an accent, we still know what she's talking about
Imagine that being your whole storyline too! And they had to talk about it like it actually had an impact on their drag
Ru didn’t wanna cut Loosey a check for the royalties

didn’t even clip it down lol
🧿🫦🧿 sasha rn
🔵👄🔵
oh my fucking ...god
Ru’s face lol
Give it to me Straight!!!
Tbh i loved it. I liked Marcia’s too, it was different. Jax’s was inexcusable
I didn’t even see it but I agree.
I think Willow had like one line in hers
Me too!! Our state isn’t perfect, but we do a lot right
I'm a Masshole and I've never loved Connecticut more 🥹
I thought it was definitely more balanced than the previous ones
I haven’t seen 12 yet but only heard negatives about it. Is it good?
When is that asteroid coming back to beam me up?
Nah Anetra wont even acknowledge Aja's existence and it fucking kills Aja. Definitely the better thing to do.
She got laptops to sell and people to tell to eat her ass
🧿👄🧿
I thought perhaps I just missed it. All I remember is a lot of reaction shots, but no actual  chatter.
Her own mom outshown her tonight
Anetra is pretty much on the DL too, when she was talking about stealing the baby doll, suddenly Spice cut her off... I think this season just had a lot of queens who aren't as loud.
Or an "I was wrong" lol. Not even with the 40" wig!
I think Jax got the Robin edit tonight
PhD in Dragological Science
She's hosting the mtv awards and by GOD they're gonna get you to watch it.
If they brought it up she would’ve stayed quiet. They probably did and she just didn’t have anything to say so they cut it. She’s been silent on it the whole time
Her MTQ she says “if someone has drama with me I’ll wait until they’re finished and ask if they feel better once they’re done” she’s so unbothered, it makes her so hot
And it’s the same 4 people talking 😂
They're filling it with commercials.
They had so much unused footage that we finally get to see. Geez, thanks MTV
You can tell shes one of Ru's favorites
Confirmed:  She's got her purse and slipped her shoes back on.
![gif](giphy|lRd0Rjocsb4kirQmfB)
Irene wanted more attention
AND managed to keep the print seamless, which is EXTREMELY HARD to do
Please don't give Irene any more ideas for the talent show hunny
me every episode this season:
This was filmed before the finale
that’s just who they are, they were never involved in the seasons drama to begin with
![gif](giphy|gk9vWUE6EAgQKtAqaX)
NAWT a shared 10 LMAO
its giving bathroom break
You just saw all of it from Rhonda and and Aura’s mom.
That fake accent comment seemed to really affect her.
My bf and I thought she might’ve been high haha her eyes were pretty bloodshot. Either way I love her and I’m always happy to see her on screen haha
Luxx is a smart girl, despite the brains/beauty read. She knows what’s happening.
they're all one of the twins, i assume
they showed a clip where she said she runs the drag race reddit lol
it's so predictable i have to laugh like it's tv darlings no one is making physical threats against each other and people are allowed to argue and still both be good people at heart 😭😭
Gurl, every season, it’s so transparent.
Irene is a little more nuanced and aware. It’s very wink wink nudge nudge. Luxx and Mistress don’t make you feel like you’re in on the joke. It feels more pointed. Just my perception
There's a different energy there tbh
That is essentally what generic means and to assume other wise is splitting hairs tbh.
Why did u think she didn’t before? She’s the clear winner. Coming from an Anetra stan
Lol she’s giving airtime to the other girls coz they need it more.
Similar to other reunions like Sasha Velour
I think there’s a real consideration that the reunions are high risk/low reward affairs. The die hards tend to be the bulk of the audience for the reunion and we have decided who we’re backing. Nobody’s going to win votes here, but you definitely can lose ground and get more flack.
YOU DON'T LOVE ME.  Everything about that season is so quotable.
But they gon act innocent lol
Two things can be true at once.
The comments below yours are deranged lmao 💀
Luxx is a bully.  See her argument with Trinity this week.  She’s a great queen, but she’s got a short fuse and she’s just not very smart in when to show the ‘confident’ card and when to simply shut up.
Of course, so?  Doesn't make it a lie
Maybe it was post production shenanigans??
![gif](giphy|46dmRPge77Bp99NPKG|downsized)
You mean Rebecca
Ru doesn't have time to type - she said it out loud and Michelle typed it up  on her iPad
it's a joke she's been making all season lol she did it when she was in the bottom episode 1 i think
I thought she was joking
she has been accused of over dramatizing her accent
There's a video of Salina from a few years ago where she doesn't have the accent she has on the show at all, so some people think she's faking the accent
She was non existent the entire season
I think before honestly.
Nope happened before
no before i think
well i am white but i'd say salina's drag is an exaggeration of the LA culture she grew up in, so she's within her rights to speak in an exaggerated accent if she wants, but idk if it's really "fake" like she does kinda have an accent when she speaks but it's a lot more subdued yknow
There's a video of Salina from a few years ago where she doesn't have the accent she has on the show at all, so some people think she's faking the accent
Confused because I watched footage of Lucy telling the audience at her home bar not to send any hate to Luxx or Mistress, and I feel like she’s also tweeted about it… but who am i
I'm not gonna say it wouldn't be nice for queens to say something every time people that claim to be fans of them go and attack another queen, but...it doesn't actually stop anyone, and I think it's because most of them aren't actually truly fans of the queen they're claiming to be defending.  They're trolls getting a kick out of causing division in the fandom and getting reactions from the queens.
That’s not true though, Loosey did address her fans at a show she did a couple of weeks ago
Exactly! Loosey is NOT enjoying it, clearly never has. Mistress needs to know her audience
You can see right through it because she’s STILL only “cutting it up” with Loosey.
you are insane for saying this but i respect the gall
They're focusing on the top highlight of the top four, and that's definitely Luxx's biggest moment.
Does anyone have a gif of Violet saying "pants!" on the Pitstop? Thanks in advance.
No
No lol
See I’ve always been surprised people took Luxx that way in that argument. I was actually very confused when Malaysia got so upset about it because I thought it was all in good fun until that point. But I guess this is a perfect example of how these kinds of misunderstandings happen. Perception is everything, and if Malaysia felt hurt then that was valid for her in that moment.
Nah she looks lovely
she was very genuine with the twins this season no?
I’ve seen her turn it out outside the show, but on the show she’s been just ok.
Delusion...fool yourself
Poppy was just serving Rebecca Glasscock realness.
There's a video of Salina from a few years ago where she doesn't have the accent she has on the show at all, so some people think she's faking the accent. That's where it comes from.
I don’t think you can this year. I believe this reunion was filmed before they filmed the finale.
Usually the person in the final four who starts a bunch of arguments and talks a lot didn’t make it till like the very top two or win the season.
I don’t think there’s been any sign of a winners edit so far
Her forced grin is terrifying, poignant, haunting. I want to see her in a Stepford wife Westworld mashup as the Dolores character.
Yeah that wig is gorgeous
A Yellowjackets ad. It’s a great show!
Yellowjackets promo! Great show
I think Malaysia or Spice probably
probably Spice tbh
Can the winner also be Miss Congeniality?
It’s Rebecca Glasscock’s entrance look
I'm gathered and having a great time
An iconic one!
Queens hyped up this reunion I thought it was going to be more wild
Mistress stole the copy of Guru from a challenge, so that’s what it’s referencing lol.
Yes
It’s the same cut as her lalaparuza look but this has a skirt to it
Reminds me of her lalaparuza leotard
Mistress?  Really?  She’s been speaking 40% of the time.  I agree on Luxx.  She definitely blew some steam this week on the socials!
all the queens this season are really smug. none of them seem like the exploding type
I really actually forgot she was there
ok
ok
You're so brave
you need to let loose
This isn't a fat joke, but it makes me think of Cartman.
I love luxx and her personality. People are just haters bc she’s snarky and hella talented.
Watch out sis, you about to get blocked.
y'all sensitive white fans are the problem lol. just because someone said something a year ago doesn't mean they deserve hate
Cry harder
How was it racist… her accent is put on. go look at older videos of her on YouTube
Yuuuup.  She's rubbed me the wrong way for weeks now. There's a point when it's too much.
I think there’s growth in character, it’s just that 2 of the top 5 were already delightful humans (Sasha, Anetra), the other 3 are stubborn (or for the delusional edit), and we hardly saw the others.  I think Marsha and Selina grew up on the show.
Malaysia did although she was in the right imo. She don’t know y’all why ya playing with her??
They said you wanna complain about one hour episodes? Let’s make the reunion and finale two hours!!!!
We’re like 1/4 the way in?  Also, season 13??
there’s still like an hour and half left. calm tf down💀💀
Sasha and Anetra are both veeeery quiet and confident
Sasha’s getting the quiet and confident edit like Sasha in S9. That’s all I can tell for now.
Mistress has been monopolizing the conversation so I can’t tell tbh
I mean, Mistress is being a little messy so maybe she isn't in the final lip sync. But she's also saying she's in her "congenial" and "angelic" eras, so maybe this is congenial *for her* lmao.
This is literally just the MIB show. Anetra has talked like once and same with LUXX. Sasha has had a few moments but no one is able to speak but MIB
Just trying to figure out what his head looks like
Low-key rooting for Jamaal and Clare
Speak for yourself. I'm having a good time.
Who should have won
i get what you're saying but have you ever heard of speaking spanish
I know Salina amps it up when she's in drag but it isn't a blaccent.
bUT tHe EdiT!!
No
No
We've heard a lot from Spice
I mean, I study math and that kinda *is* how math works (sometimes) buuuut I don't think it applies to wigs
How I feel like she was only shown like once??
how? need to know so I can 100% agree
How?
... it's a Rebecca Glasscock reference.
you clearly can't even remember who's actually talking lol so don't take it to heart !
She called herself bully?
I don’t think she wants you
Sounds like you're the problem.
She doesn’t need you.
everyone at my viewing party was obv living for Mistress the most tho? like moreso than they did throughout the main season, even. I thought she ran this reunion lmao
In the context of hair, wouldn’t that just mean something overly straightened and damaged by heat?  I’d say it’s the equivalent of calling Irene’s wig withered.
1. no?   2. It was a joke and she *immediately* said just kidding
Well Tamar….
Well Tamar..
Rebecca glasscock
In your hater era
not your boomer era
The pineapple is a symbol of welcome/hospitality in Hawaii where Sasha is from so she has a pineapple tattoo in her mouth to invite people inside 🤭
If you drink pineapple juice it makes your cum taste better supposedly. So a blow job joke?
It's 2 hours if u dont wanna watch stop watching lol
She’s doing Rebecca Glasscocks entrance look from season 1. It’s intentional.
It’s Rebecca Glasscock’s entrance look lol
I mean, her intro was about her quitting drag so I think she's in her bare minimum era.
Boss Bitch *was* a good song tho
![gif](giphy|H46Dtwtwo1FDO)
Two
Like Anetra said, she likes the drama...she just doesn't participate.  She's no fool.
We may not have won Drag Race this year but we did win the NCAA tournament so we did get a trophy this year….lol  Yes I’m in my sports era.
When I see what else is going on right now across the states about MANY topics I love that I’m here more and more
… *Look over there!*  All jokes aside it’s actually pretty good! Despite that…*one* person.
Who tf you hearing things from??  ![gif](giphy|P6JcFKpn52t15Nqie2)
Personally I love it. The cast is amazing. But there is a bit of a shadow cast by Sh*rry P*e
12's reputation is ruined by the Sherry Pie situation
Crystal, Gigi, Jaida, Heidi, Jan, Nicky Doll…it’s a great cast. Sherry Pie was the front runner though and so the edit is weird, and her being there casts a strange shadow over the proceedings.
Sasha knows better than to get involved in Nonsense, and Anetra is The Quiet One Anyway.
Yeah, that was pretty fucked up.
You need to revaluate your perception because there is an unaware race bias there lol
Luxxx being seen as a bully makes me screech with laughter. She couldn’t honestly hurt a fly. People need a thicker skin throwing that word around so easily
You do not know what you are talking about
she was in the right....like why was trinity coming for someone a decade younger than her and saying she has a nasty attitude when she doesn't know her 😭 we don't know these people why are we calling them BOOLIES like this is high school
You say “argument *with* trinity” but yet in the same breath you say *only* Luxx is a bully? Make it make sense
Trinity is objectively a nasty person though. There are better examples lmao.
A black queen is a "bully", "not very smart", "too confident", and should know her place/when to shut her mouth.  4/4 racist tropes, congrats.  Edit: just re-read, and there were actually *more* in that comment. You're like an olympian-level dog whistler
Maybe she does has mean tendencies, but not for arguing with Trinity. Are you joking? Trinity is the queen of Twitter drama lol
She’s definitely got some maturing to do
we know girl you've been complaining all night 😭 they're talking abt you, just have fun ❤️ we are just the audience!
Michelle in her Stenographer Era
She also put on her socials “NEVER send hate to my sisters. Especially on my behalf. You can support me without tearing anyone else down ✌🏼” after the Rusical episode too.
Bob nailed it when he said on Watchery when you have that kind of personality, you have to learn to read the room. If they’re not feeling it, stop playing with them.
you must not know about blending makeup lmaoo
Has no one heard of code switching?  EDIT: Also it’s super weird you’ve made this same comment at least five times.
I would say depends on when it was filmed. We know this one was filmed the day before the finale was filmed, but season 9's reunion was filmed after which is why shea and trinity were so salty and ready to fight. I hope they realize this next year and put it back to after.
the only thing people hate more than someone being more successful/talented than them is when that person obviously knows it ;)
Salina just found her inner rage if anything lol.
Loosey would say herself
These redditors don’t understand that urban areas with many pocs have their own intertwined lingo.
What does speaking Spanish have to do with blaccents?
Right?! They always do this to the person who will win the season like Aquaria or Willow.
They always do this to the person who will win the season in these sit down reunions (Aquaria, Willow)
The era that never ends\~
she's doing rebecca glasscock's entrance look from s1 yall......
And hopefully the Women’s team will bring us home another next year.
We did indeed.   I have a lot of family that went to UConn, so I always root for them in sports!! It’s always exciting when they win
Don’t we have a chance at a hockey one too?
Yup. I’m never leaving here. We have it really good and I didn’t realize just how good until so many other states have started imploding
A friend of mine, said friend was also the one that got me into drag race. He said 12-14 all suck but cast good and that the only ones that matter in 12 are Jaida, Heidi, and Jan so I just went with that.
How can you jump to that conclusion girl I’m black and Latino 💀 stfu and stop with the white savior bs. I love all these girls.
How can you automatically default to what I said being a racial bias. If luxx and MIB were white I would very much feel the same way
They didn't say only Luxx. However, the conversation was about Luxx, hence why they were referenced. Hope that cleared it up for you.
Make your comment make sense.  They’re both bullies.  It’s just an example of a short fuse.
when will fans learn that being funny or good at art =/= being a good person lol. I don't think Luxx or Trinity are "objectively nasty," they're nuanced humans who are nice sometimes and rotted other times. I will say that I can't see myself being friends IRL with them, but I still respect them as artists and sisters.
Sorry you read it that way.  No racism intended at all.  Please tell me this.  What (based on the edit, at minimum) do you think defines Luxx’s persona on the show besides her fashion and deep knowledge of Ru?  She’ll tell you herself it’s her confidence.  It’s what she brings up herself on panels.  She was totally a *bully* in the makeover episode.  Maybe it’s hyperbole to compare her to a school bully, but there was no interest in working with the teacher.  It was “I’m going to make you this and you’ll wear it.”  With regard to her intellect, she says some witty things, but she seems to love arguing for arguing’s sake.  She could have restrained from some of the targets today from the other Queens.  Even a single “sorry, I shouldn’t have said what I said” would’ve shown another dimension and a bit of empathy and EQ.  It’s clear that Loosey thought Luxx was a bit of a bully - it’s clear in her body language.  But, you can allege I’m making racist comments if you want to dumb things down.
:/ there’s a difference between code switching and putting on a character. Code switching ESPECIALLY for POC is done for survival
It wasn't code switching, it was a video she specifically made about the "Salina Estitties" character.  And I'm so sorry for copy and pasting, you're right, I should reword the same comment over and over because that's super productive lmao.
No, that's just you reading it that way.
And I stand by that being the bare minimum LOL
Yea, hopefully we’ll have a healthy team. There were injury problems all year long but I know they’ll bounce back.
Yes, Quinnipiac plays Minnesota in the finals!
Don’t listen to that friend 12 and 14 are top tier. And if you love fashion 13 is absolutely worth the watch
Im also latino so no white savior BS here lol.if you love them all you should no the racial bias it happens on the fandom but you do you I guess lol
You still grew up in a racist society. As a fellow black person I think we can both say internalized racism is a thing. I have racial bias, internalized homophobia, and internalized misogyny. The problem is when everyone doesn’t want to acknowledge this and think about how it effects everyday.
Literally where does it say Trinity is a bully in the original reply. Find it and show it to me
If they’re both bullies why didn’t you just say that? Your entire reply is a full takedown on Luxx and you had NO energy for trinity.
I didn’t read it that way, you said it that way. Everything you said is a textbook racist dog whistle, there’s not much else to it.
She’s a Latina who grew up in Stockton. What character do you think she’s playing?
It was an audition tape AKA a glorified job interview, and a far more productive choice would be letting it go.
It’s true. Check jaxx’s face when she said it
Yes, so much gagworthy runways have been served by Tina burner, Lala Ri, Eliott and more!
So automatically because in my opinion Irene is a different kind of shady that is a racially biased opinion just because Luxx and MIB aren’t white? What is that logic? Sure there’s obviously racial bias but you can’t just leverage that every single time someone says something not overly positive about a POC queen
So I’m supposed to automatically think any negative way I feel about a poc’s actions is because of racial bias? That sounds disingenuous.
Bless your heart.
Because this isn’t a conversation about Trinity.  We’re not talking about whether Trinity is or isn’t a bully.  We’re talking about Luxx, and I’m just referencing the freshest anecdotes. Do you want me to edit my post to write in parenthesis to clarify that Trinity is also a erratic human being and maybe also a bully?  Lol.
Believe it or not.  You’re looking to argue and attack.  You’re literally attacking me in another community to corral downvotes on the post.  I provided my reasoning.  If you want to infer something totally different, you do you, but it’s not in good faith and your comments are incredibly disrespectful in a personal way.
Are…you serious? Did you watch the season or not? She even said Salina is a character😭 Salina in and out of drag are two completely different people
Girl, I replied to people who were asking if there was context. I gave the context. You're allowed to make of it what you will. Chill out a little.
Luxx said it was a family heirloom. Heirlooms are passed down over generations. A wig passed down over generations would likely be dried out, thirsty, etc.—meaning “fried.” Stop trying to make this into something it’s not.
Exactly! You’ll gag (derogatory) and gag again! (affectionate)
No. But for example if someone is being called aggressive or another stereotype. Or if you see other people pointing it out then it is time to evaluate what you are thinking. It’s about accepting you may be wrong. It’s about accepting if you want to break a cycle then you have to actually work on it. Bias means that we are going to have an  initial response to things inherently especially with group think and hype.   Like if you laugh at Violet or Raven saying shady things. If you are happy when Loosey and Jan talking about being “robbed”. Acknowledge why when someone else doing a similar thing illicits a different response. The easiest and laziest thing to do is to say “well they just do it differently”.
so u can’t find it.. 💀
How did you become the victim here?  I’ll add one thing: you seem like the type of person who thinks they can talk their way out of anything, but even when you polish a turd we can all smell it
Then what’s your point? You’re mad at her for… doing what pretty much other every drag queen does?
Ok so then how was it valid for you to jump to accusing me of racial bias… is that not literally what you just did? I agree. The western world in general is a racist society. But not every negative thing said about a POC person is because of that bias. And for the record, I absolutely despise violet and raven, not that it matters. They have terrible attitudes. I don’t vibe with Luxx. Sorry. Nothing to do with race. I just don’t like her. And I’m allowed to not like her.  TO ME they do it differently. And I stand by that. If Irene was black I’d be saying the same thing. I also am pretty sure she’s Native if I recall correctly.
I posted an opinion, you attacked me here, and you attacked me on another community.  You’re not serious about engaging with anyone’s point of view if it disagrees with your gut instinct.  Take care.
Nah hun my point is very clearly stated. Does Monet, Bob, Trixie, or any one else do that? Nah just her and Laganja back in season 6
Have a blessed night
i would say AS2 is the returning queens/mirror reveal/phi phi face crack

honorable mention for 11 is “I WAS READY TO DO SO!”  it’s obvs not on the level of sorry not sorry, but it has been quoted a lot on the show and i think maybe the pit stop too
For me season 9 is Maskgate.
DU: Out of drag Etc. Etc. uses they/them pronouns. For example, THEY haven't been in the top, so we won't be seeing THEM in the final.
I didn’t remember this 😭 I love Tammy
I have been both at parties, many times
Not the Vaseline filter and 420p production value. 💀 it's iconic in the BEST way
Let Loose was a cultural reset. Mistress in general was in her iconic era all season long, too.
salina saying FREE WILLY  anetra choosing to lip sync against jax instead of spice  sasha’s neck crack  letting loose (duh)  salina being the therapist every episode in that one specific step in her makeup routine
![gif](giphy|rSKMgVOJlQTmVEOlq4|downsized)  The moment we all adopted the Let Loose Lifestyle^(tm)
I think:  Anetra vs Marcia lipsync.  Let loose  All the things MIB did and said.
Anetra’s talent show
![gif](giphy|nz3fsgdWF2OxwWSL8U)
I think for now the most iconic moment this season is Anetra jumping over Marcia. I hope the finale is super gaggy tho like Sasha Velour levels.
Sasha saying that she’s happy to be “the older one” because SO MANY trans women don’t even get to live past 30
Not sure if or where it ranks on the scale of iconography, but I often find myself thinking about Sashas (fucking ridiculous yet utterly wonderful and oddly adorable) teleportation neck cracks
Anetra existing.
Luxx's response to "who should go home"  Anetra wondering if she's a lesbian because Sasha looked so damn good  Ru calling for the sniper when spice did the trot  Sugar tripping multiple times during her lipsync  Anetra's amazing split at the end of her talent show  Anetra's duck walking in general  MIB's "ballroom" voguing   Literally anything Sasha has done on the runway   Those are some memorable moments for sure
"Sasha is so hot. Am I a lesbian?" - Anetra
defo the different gates also luxx's & loosey's rivalry, they kinda had a shady rapport for most of the second part of the season, but then they won a challenge together like that's mother behavior ![img](emote|t5_2t3or|4822)
luxx who should go home and why
Luxx quoting drag race and stan twitter every time she opened her mouth.
Rebecca Glasscock.
Sasha colby   Anetra’s talent show 🦆   Mistress Isabelle brookes humor and shade and her talent  Letting loose  Luxx zebra fashion runway  Princess poppy as Rebecca Glasscock 💀  Malaysia ‘I SAID WHAT I SAID’ 😌  Anetra Vs Marcia x3   Salina’s runways….
Luxx’s who should go home Ted talk  Spice wearing a hair net during the photoshoot  Anetra’s Crystal dress  Anetra “Do y’all think that’s fair?”  Irene picking a fight over the 40 inches  Just all the gates I guess  Loosey’s going above and beyond with her delusion (ONE MAIN TWO MINIS)   Because of the 40 min edit, we didn’t really get to see many moments outside the challenges (especially the mini challenges! 😭) so that’s all I can think of.
Oh yeah duh, "Let Loose" has to be at the top for cultural impact.   I've had a really hard time picking a single MIB moment because she has so many little hilarious cutaways. Might just have to go with a "Mistress being Mistress" bonus.
She was definitely in her era era.
Holy shit. Sasha was so amazing last night! Apparently the show sold out within 17 minutes after tickets went live. I was very fortune to have the opportunity to meet her and tell her how much I appreciate her representing the girls <3  &#x200B;  She did 2 performances: one in a gown to a song from Waitress, then the one from this video to Paramore.
She put a lot of trust on that front row of twinks lmao. Lucky it wasn’t a [Katy Perry situation.](https://youtu.be/0eAiryBE-xQ)
I would never wash my hands.
Sasha Colby crowdsurfing to "Misery Business" is LGBT rights personified
What is it like to be in the presence of a goddess
Imagine getting to have a single drop of Sashas sweat on you ☺️
I mean I think I would die if I was in that crowd of people that got to hold mother up
Mother loves and supports all of us, it is right the people should support her mortal body.
“On the Midnight Radioooo.” Where my Hedwig fans at?
Ugh I wish I knew she was going to be in Boston. I live 2 hours away.. but I’m certain she will be on WTW when they come to boston in august
Mother is mothering
What was the venue?
Sasha makes me want to propose
She bestowed her presence on our fair city. Sigh.
Anything you can tell me to prep? I'm seeing her next month too. I can't wait!
Goddammit why do I always find out about these things after they happen?!
I’m so glad I got a chance to see sasha a bunch of times while visiting LA over the past 5-6 years because it’s gonna be so hard (and way more expensive) to see her in the future! but I’m thrilled that she gets the opportunity to share her talent with the whole world now.
She did a performance to my favorite band ever …   I can’t believe it’s possible to love her even more than I already did.
Tell us more please, how was it like in her presence?  I am dying to see her perform live.
Upper body strength?  ![gif](giphy|wIRvHEm7vf8w8)
Lmao how have I never seen that before
Lmao they had her in a handstand at one point 😆
Oh my god, what a nightmare
Amazing. She has this way of making everyone in the room feel special. When taking tips, she'll give what I like to think of as "finger hugs" where she will make sure to give a little squeeze/touch which I love.
It would be like a baptism
*I thought the same thing!* When Yitzak falls back into the crowd in the blonde wig, I cry every time.
She’s going to be in Providence, RI this Saturday! Meet and greet is sold out but they have limited door tickets available.
Legacy nightclub
Definitely bring comfy shoes if you want to stand in a big crowd close to the stage like this! It takes a lot of leg strength to not topple over with everyone bumping into each other trying to get close to her. She’s an amazing performer so have a blast! Seeing her brought me lots of happiness
You can feel the respect and love that everyone in the room has for her, and likewise her love and respect for the fans. She really gave it her all while performing and interacted with the crowd a lot (making sure to touch hands while taking tips, playing around with people by taking their phones and doing selfies on stage, crowd surfing, pouring a drink on herself, eye contact, etc etc). At the end of her first performance everyone started chanting her name.
🥺🥹🥲
I love that Sugar/Spice referenced her this season and now Poppy. Glasscock for All Stars 9!
I love how Rebecca is still doing more drag in this photo than Poppy lmaoooo
I unironicly stan Princess Poppy. The best drag for me is fun and stupid and she gets it
It’s honestly so smart. We can really see how drag race has evolved since Season 1.
Come through Lucky Jeans
This is the shoot of the season right there
The fact that Poppy's version looks so boxy, ill fitting and not cinched at all makes this 10 times funnier. SHE IS SERVING CAMP
I remember in one of the preseason interviews she showed up as Project Runway Ru.
That face in the upper-left is giving 1-900-OK-FACE
This is one of the top looks of drag race herstory, if you don't agree you are just wrong
Poppy is fucking hilarious, I can’t with her
I stan Cess Popoppy
I love her so fucking much
she is so stupid i love her, i understand her reasoning to quit drag but i wish she wouldnt tbh.
I gasped, really. She did thaaat
I love this queen so much
This is so fucking funny
actually had this thought a while back, i would love for a queen to serve 2000s skinny jeans-and-top ass bitch glam
The funniest part to me is the plain shirt cuz you clearly can’t see what Rebecca’s original print is this is realistic
Giving Craigslist t4m realness.
ICESS POP^OPPY
Hahahahahahhahahaha this is amazing
Deep cut
THE WAY I HOLLERED
I’m glad I searched it and realized this thread had already been started. Def in her IDGAF era.
It’ll take a lot to top this for me for the rest of this year 💅
He quit drag so why spend money?
It was bad then; it’s bad now.
Not the read she thought it was
That shirt looks custom
She is... the mother I've never had
Thank you for posting this because I was so confused by her look 😂
I gay gasped and screamed. Major points for Poppy.
Every time they cut to her in the reunion, I tried so hard not to laugh. Gold.
best reunion look of the night
She's literally smart! A meme queen.
Imagine Poppy, Sugar & Spice and Rebecca Glasscock all on one season
Not to be shady, but Nina Flowers posted a picture of them together recently, because she ran into her at the airport. Rebecca no longer does drag, and works for Delta Airlines. Nina was like, "I hope you find joy on your new journey, sister!"
When did they reference her I don’t remember lol
Because Becky actually padded lmao
Poppy is a live action shitpost
Her talent show is one of my all time favorites!
To be fair, when Miss Glasscock did this on Season 1 it wasn't really representative of what everyone was wearing back then. Look at her in the bottom right photo, she's stood next to Akashia and Nina who are much more dragged up.  Yes drag/drag race has evolved, but I don't think that many drag queens were wearing jeans and t-shirts back then Haha!  Not to say I don't love it though! On Rebecca, Poppy... and Dida Ritz. Bonjour Ladies!!!
They look like Cremieux but that’s just me
Yeah held at gunpoint by a firing squad
Wasn't it Marcia?
"HI, I'M BIJOU"  the best part was the phone number was a number short!
Who, Poppy or Rebecca?
Screamed.
Symone's reigning look was basically this
Willow Pills entrance?
It’s iconic though  Because of the fact it’s literally a t-shirt and jeans
it was in the first 7 mins the youtube channel releasef be so fr
Cause someone has to go home first, second, third and fourth.
How is this even a little shady? She has a stable job, it's hot to be an air steward, you get to walk through terminals like you own them with all your uniformed hotties. And out of America's rotten airline services, delta's the better option.  I'd love to work for an airline.
They seem really happy with their job and life. They had a little post up about Spice giving them a shout out on this season too. It was really sweet.
Wait WHAT? Becky with the Glasscock is my coworker and I didn’t even know it?? This is the highlight of my week
It was a mirror moment where they were talking about queens from past seasons. I’m sorry I can’t recall the episode number. I feel like I maaay have been the episode Spice went home, but I could be totally wrong.
I fucking loved her talent show and thought it was dead on for something Ru would love. It was stupid. It was funny.   To hear her say at Roscoe’s that the judges were like silent was shocking. I thought it was hilarious.
Some girls were doing a lot, but some were serving mall drag. I mean look at Jujubee…in general lol. We have Raven on fashion photo review and she came into All Stars in a pretty plain look comparatively. Ongina didn’t really walk into season 1 with a ground breaking look.
What did you just call me?!
CUE THE SNIPERS
I love when two of my favorite shows over lap. How has Tina Fey never been on drag race. I need her and Amy Poehler to be on snatch game and then be the guest judges for the week.
Both 😭😭😭
Spilled 💀
Well, no, I wouldn’t want to work for an airline but we also shouldn’t job shame. All jobs are important. What’s wrong with making a living? It’s just that hopefully in a better world everyone would make money doing what they love, whether it be drag or stewardessing.
Whaaaat Ru was in Pickle Surprise I thought for sure she'd love this stupid shit. That's so sad. The song still gets stuck in my head! I love puppets!
I always love when Ongina talks about her entrance and she saw Nina, Shannel, and Rebecca and she thought that Nina and Shannel were the hosts
C’mon, mall!
Bendelacremieux is in le hizzieux for shizzieux garçonnnnnn?!
Throw Shangela in there so she gets the free win
The only drag race quote that truly makes me cringe.
#rebeccaglasscock4allstars8
That’s very cute
This is super heart warming 🥰🥰🥰
there should be a season 1 reunion like maybe a special mini season where the og rugirls do a few of the most iconic challenges that came later down the line and get to have the spotlight on them and one gets crowned or better yet they all get one. world of wonder hire me  ![gif](giphy|l1KVaDCiVf666HcmQ|downsized)
I love this. Becky with the glass cock needs a Rudemption!
The OG trade of the season
Rebecca please come back to drag and go on all stars or a regular season please please please! Us Glasscocks need you!
Omg who did this 😍😍
#HoldingoutforGlasscock
I think it would be hilarious if Becky returned but as a pit crew member
You mean AS9? AS8 is already filmed
And he's so much hotter now 🥵 (respectfully)
Fuck Jade’s meaty tuck
It was Ru! RuPaul!
Honey it's a joke
And her little dog too! I'm talking about you, Michelle!
![gif](giphy|AVYgfmc0UiP9m)  # BUT WHY IS SHE GREEN
The corset, bra, and panty really runs in the family
I’ve liked a ton of her runway looks but the reunion look is not doing it for me. Might be the angle but the codpiece thong with a corset is not my fav.
I still feel like it has the same issue as the original look where it's as if she spent all the money on the detailed embellishments and then couldn't afford an outfit to go underneath.
i'm still so upset we didn't get to see all of her looks on the runway this season
Unrelated to her outfit, i just know Irene is gonna eat the reunion with her commentary and solidify herself as even more of an icon
The details are stunning but the whole ensemble on her body is not flattering at all.
Is she wearing a merkin??
Everything she could’ve brought this season really was spectacular. They’d be dumb to not bring her back for All Stars.
😬
You're shady
I Guess she really did give her padding to Amethyst
Can the House of Bosco retire this combo already. The bra, corset and panty are so done
She heard her friend got a 3d printer and told that bitch to get to work
![gif](giphy|2NKyCSgXNZlvnbKIvu|downsized)  your faves ~~can never~~ will always
Doesn't it look like it's hanging four inches too low? I'm hoping it reads better when I watch the reunion
RPDRUK 'prehistoric' runway teas
Lol the fact she won that week too with that runway
I only love this look from the nipples up. The rest is just odd. The panties are particularly weird & don’t seem to fit her properly.
Yes! It’s so low, the amount of skin between the two is just not very flattering.   Like I said could be the angle so I’m hoping it’s better live! The armoresque top is stunning and the mug is great!
![gif](giphy|IIxNxeQPSkQQFVTW0D)  Ehhhhh
Also I didnt like the wig either lol
I’m quitting drag.. you’re welcome :)
"if you come for me, i WILL apologize immediately!" loll
OBSESSED with the fact that they made them do little Housewives taglines 😩 Poppy wins for me, Marcia a semi-distant second
Princess Poppy as Rebecca Glasscock - squirrels, it’s over.  ![gif](giphy|3og0IEd2cvEQlSr1gQ|downsized)
Thoughts:  -	The Housewives-style entrances are perfect for this cast. -	What the fuck is Anetra wearing. Girl did we not tip enough at the gigs? 😭  -	Marciax3 time-traveled to the 90s! -	Mistress is the Shannel to Poppy’s Rebecca Glasscock. -	Malaysia really is “gowns, beautiful gowns.” Respect. -	Poppy’s S1 entrance look realness… no choice but to stan. -	Robin Fierce, baby I’m sorry. -	Salina is the most beautiful used maxi pad I’ve ever seen. -	Sasha embodying “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” realness here.
Sasha looks incredible even with the Coco Montrese contacts, I'm stunned. Irene, Malaysia and ofc Poppy killed it with the looks 😊
“If you come for me, I *will* apologize.”  I am pretty sure the entire train car heard me snort laugh.
The gasp I made at the very sight of Malaysia
I am LIVING for the Real Housewives of RuPaul's Drag Race.
Best look and reference of the season!!
I thought she said "I'm quoting drag" lol
I love Marciax3 even more for referencing one of my favorite housewives taglines ever
Luxx going down the line be like:
I think it’s best she looked on the show.
💀 I got to Luxx and realized this was long enough, hit send instead. (I was not feeling the shape/cut of her dress but the hair/makeup were great and that color was beautiful on her.)
Season 12’s top 3 will always be my personal favourite. It's a shame they didn't get a big live finale because they truly deserve it.
Wait, were Bianca and Adore wearing dresses made of the same material? How did I not notice this before?
Marcia^3’s power.
Come through multiples of three!
Season 3 final 3 is still in my opinion the closest call for a winner ever in drag race.
wait these are literally all my favorite top 3/4 😭
I would say season 5 and 8 stronger than 12 and 15
Well, there are a few misses…
few sneaks
True, but at the same time I love that they got to show their creativity in that format. More so than in the regular finales. Wish they’d incorporate a bit more of that in non-lockdown seasons.
Yeah but then we wouldn’t have gotten piñata and honestly I don’t think we would have gotten the free like a bird performance either
I believe Bianca made them both.
the doors she’s opened
That's because it is. Manila and Raja had **identical** track records. Maxis, minis, highs, safes, lows, bottoms. Even types of challenge wins. They both won two design challenges and one performance challenge each. They both had iconic moments on the runway, were both confessional narrators and had pretty close fan support through the entire season.
say their names
Oh absolutely! I actually love that aspect of that format. Just wish they were able to celebrate like all the other finalists.
Good point  ![gif](giphy|Wp77xewCDvPJY2SS4L|downsized)
Princess Poppy was like: I didn't win shit, I'm not gonna spend shit
Also seems like Marcia’s look is a loose reference to Cher from Clueless?
Not everyone missing Salina's reference. This is what happens when nobody walks the children in nature.
Not you forgot Salina
Why is Sugar looking like Giselle Lullaby in that pic lol
Sugar and spice were fully raised by their tv, switching between Nickelodeon and the Disney channel.
This is really what dreams are made of
Sing to me, Paolo!
HOW DID I NOT CLOCK THE HILARY DUFF REFERENCE OMG!  ![gif](giphy|ug9SeZBFLKHtK)
Lizzie and Isabella is such a vibe . The twins are best
The twins look good
I love Poppy's sense of humour. No one else would think of that
Poppy said "Chapstick?!?! i'll show you chapstick"
![gif](giphy|RMatvgc3eMIyk)
The twins are iconic
The way I kept clicking next. I feel bamboozled
seriously how do you take Rebecca Glasscock as your inspiration and make it look *more pedestrian*🏕️
Ahh you’re right! I totally forgot to post it! 🤦🏻‍♂️
![gif](giphy|HRz44Z2pmFfjO)
I forgot the clueless reference, I forgot the To Wong Foo reference…IM A MESS  ![gif](giphy|J0tIHsd1PxKP7JRdZl)
Gather her mawma, this is such a crime.
Ha ha ha ha yes! They could be drag Mom and Daughter in that look!!
Lol I thought they were referencing these two:  ![gif](giphy|YBNZihYHTiafS)
Sasha said she’s the queen she wished stay longer lol
The fact that it was possible made Becky's attention to detail in her mall pedestrian drag seem pretty impressive lol
By not showing your bra strap.
We need a new post with your rectractions, miss
😭❤️
Eat my ass & then I’ll do it :)
The drama chair! It has the best camera angle!
good catch!!
I cant wait for Mother Superiorly Loose Lets Loose (tm) on ALL these whores
YESSS I can't wait to watch and re-watch spicy moments from this reunion for years to come! So many fireballs in the cast.
Preview's out ?
I wonder if that’s the “most likely to storm off set” seat? So they can make a clean escape and not ruin any shots of other queens? 🤣
Loosey’s miss América answers were what mistress had been clocking all season long, her eye looked like she was ready to explode tho 😂
Such a Great Ru-union!!  Also I can’t stop staring at jasmine’s ear in that pic 😂
That Jasmine claps to Daya 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
We give her permission, she has no excuse!
[Yes](https://youtu.be/37vbDke0RU0)
imagine if she was in a nun costume and just went THE LOOSENING IS UPON US SISTERS
My first ever Denver Pride had Chad as the headliner. She did a long ass set in full Cher, it was 97 degrees out, icon shit.
Cher is like “oh hey Chad” bc they’ve met a good amount of times
Don't know when this was but cher looks great!  (She looks younger than chad!)
It must be trippy af to see your twin performing in front of you
She looks like when people are singing happy birthday to you and you just kind of sit there awkwardly. It’s very that
She’s not even looking 💀
Is that to Cher
When was this??
Cher looks amazing
a privilege for both of them, imo
She looks kind of annoyed by it
Julie Chen
Cher giving the noochiest nooch
p r o f e s s i o n a l
That was my first pride too and she was amazing
SHAAAAAAADE
ask sugar and spice
This comment is TRUTH 😂
thank you ross matthews ❤️
she's over it lmao
I think she’s looking at a screen showing the performance.
As fabulous as Chad Michaels is, Cher realizes that she is Cher, and even the fiercest impersonator is not Cher...bitch
It's to whomever needs to hear it, including myself
I think you just need Sugar if you wanna talk about tripping.
They said performing, doll
This Reddit vid is about 6 years old so not sure if Cher really knew of Chad but this https://youtube.com/shorts/U7dV6OF5p0U shows Cher in tears of Chad's performance. Seems like Cher is appreciative of Chad.
Thank you for that video!!😭❤️❤️
That’s not Cher … omg
Little Latin boy in drag.... Why are you crying?  It's just you two is so pretty.  Oh that's all?
What's the reference, for the uneducated?
"She's a Princess. P to the R to the N to the Cess"
***That child is Latin. You don't***   ***want to get mixed up in that mess.***   ***She might be a Sandinista.***      GIRL I AM TELLING U, AS A NICARAGUAN GAY MAN MYSELF THAT QUOTE IS STILL SO HILARIOUS HAHAHAHA

A Drag movie from 1995, starring Patrick Swayze, John Leguizamo and Wesley Snipes as Drag Queens Vida, Noxeema and Chi-Chi.  It’s called “To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar”
“She’s the Latina Marilyn Monroe, and she’s got more leg’s than a bucket of chicken”
Realizing how many people here were born to late to know what a Sandinista is. Or why ChiChi Rodriguez is kind of a funny name. I’m elderly all of a sudden.
Excellent question
well, she IS almost 90. might not get out of the house much these days.
I absolutely love this movie, and it makes me so sad that it would be protested, if it was released today. How far we have fallen.
"If I was your bread would you be my butter?"
To Wong Foo TFEJN is a MUST WATCH!
![gif](giphy|xUPGcmrou39uZYUpy0|downsized)
pls educate us youngins!!! I want in on the reference too 🫣
Aye by EVERYONE.   straight men playing queer characters??? Nope.  Queer characters in a main stream movie with  white, black and latin leads? Absolutely not.
I’m so glad my (pretty reserved) dad took me to see it when I was a kid. I don’t know if he realized what it was about ahead of time… I just wanted to see the movie from the ads about the men in dresses, and the names of the actors probably had him thinking it was his type of film… but he just let me enjoy the movie and we had our weekly movie night out like like it’s totally normal to take their kids to see movies about drag queens in the mid 90s.
"Don't quote me on this, mamis, but I think this one is DE-SEE-SED."
Salina's look is a reference to the 90's gay movie "To Wong Foo: Thanks for Everything - Julie Newmar" I cannot give U much details about her look because I'd spoil the whole movie for u but John Leguizamo plays Latin drag performer ChiChi Rodriguez (who the late ChiChi DeVayne named herself after)... When Noxeema and Vida meet ChiChi for the first time Vida asks her: "little Latin boy in drag why are you crying?" and Noxeema tells her what my original comment said about the unwanted Sandinistas from my country Nicaragua 🇳🇮 🤣😂😂😂🤣  ![gif](giphy|r5QQlFlMDIakM)

What is this seating arrangement? WOW needs to take notes from Bravo.
I love the way Sasha is just reusing her LaLapaRuza look I stan an ecofriendly mother
Malaysia looks so good! ❤️
I thought Amethyst was Jimbo 🤡
I'm glad there's a reunion episode, because in all honestly I don't remember half those bitches.
Is that Irene next to Ru?
Loosey in the Drama Chair^^^^^^tm
Sasha and Anetra sitting closest to Ru...
sugar and spice giving lizzie mcguire movie
Malaysia looking incredible.
Omg I’m so excited!
They all look so flawless
Ru said seat Marcia as far away from her as possible because she don’t like her
Its actually an entirely crystal dress based off of her Lalaparuza look
That's strange
Came here too say JUST THAT!!!
In the white? Yes
That’s why Miselle don’t like you!
Yeah it definitely looked different to me. She looks great as always and if she recycled a look for the reunion I wouldn’t mind
WAIT IS IT?  slay
I know in this life I'm supposed to be trans and my medium gets to be drag. In this moment in time, I am literally the living embodiment of what they want to eradicate. I am walking in the airport always on guard knowing that my mere existence is making these people nervous and probably aroused. And I love it.  WINNER
her interviews are always so thoughtful and insightful
And is.
I’m BEGGING SASHA PLEASE ADOPT ME
![gif](giphy|YV524oZMYAihuaRMFw)  Plz Sasha I’m a mess.
I'm perplexed as to how she can make a full-time income off drag without having like a YouTube series, a podcast, a show on Wow... Like is she just performing at venues and making a livable wage off of dollar bills? None of this is shade, I'm just curious. And like, as a performer, you have to spend your own money on those looks, and I don't know if they're tax deductible 😅
This is exactly why she HAS to be crowned. A native-hawaiian transgender woman, in her late thirties and THRIVING in drag?  THEE power move against the bigots
Yes, drag is a full-time job for a lot of queens! I don’t know the exact mechanics of how they are paid, but I imagine if you’re a notable queen you get a cut from the venue etc.  I live in Brooklyn and go out a lot, and it’s pretty clear that many of the popular local girls (non-derogatory) are out there doing it full-time.
Queens get booking fees too so they're not just living off tips.
Alaska is such the business woman. This is genius. But what will it smell like? 🤔🤔🤔
Queen of hiring Bosco
It’s amazing how she stays relevant and popular, even without WOW’s backing. She’s freaking cool
She just keeps getting better. I need her to have a show or something 😭   Love the promo for this
Not the screen recording at the end
I will get it if it gets Delta’s approval
Not this being a rebrand of [Flazéda by Pearl](https://external-preview.redd.it/o5rn6CZx8CIRvtpcQiIjf1-hrhKPGgfe8hg_4drOi5g.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=69ecb470b2ac4d23bca54d58e57ec770606b101b)
not that cheap ass bottle
Her perfume on the show, she said it had notes of leather and dirt...I think it could be similar to that??
it smells like a sticker
Not Grandma’s vag?
so a glory hole?

Sasha Velour, and you just knew from how she looked and carried herself that reunion that the bi had  w o n
Crystal Methyd as Scrooge... Her mind! 🤯
Boo, Yuhua will always be the most iconic to me. Girl was giving vibes of a double shift at the nearest haunted house and Sadako’s stunt double right after. I couldn’t get enough of her.   Love the most mega ultimate winner of all winners, Yuhua Hamasaki.
YUHUA SAMARASAKI  ![gif](giphy|9x3qQ8pvA3w5Netg6q)
Y’all gotta put pictures in your comments. Can’t remember shit lol
Scarlet Envy’s [all-green look](https://i.redd.it/pfhj0e29tgu31.jpg) was so pretty!
All Stars 2: Alaska's fake leg and Katya in no makeup
Katya in the AS2 reunion with the half-burnt face lives in my mind rent free.
Plastique was STUNNING in her reunion look.
Detox, no question.
I really liked Yvie’s look
THIS JUST IN - Princess Poppy as Rebecca Glasscock is THE new favourite reunion look!
Recency bias may play a role but Daya Betty looked *magnificent* in the last season's reunion. She looked like some kind of elf royalty.
Kameron's look was sensational.
Sasha Velour
Adding Princess Poppy here ASAP!!!
Brooke Lynn Hytes' reunion look is my favorite look of all time period
Poppy's Rebecca Glasscock tribute will dethrone all reunion looks. Pure drag excellence
I remember step down looks, but not a lot of reunion look. First thing that comes to mind is season 12. Ru in his purple hoodie and blue facekini. And Jan in her facecrack printed robe.
A’KERIA
S10 eureka
Literally anyone can wear anything on this show but it will NEVER be as great as Detox’s Season 5 reunion/finale look to me. It is forever imprinted in my brain.
Shout out to Aquaria for her Brown Cow Stunning look
S10 had such good reunion looks. Yuhua, Mo, Cracker, ugh so good.
Dusty Ray Bottoms looked AMAZING. Loved every single thing about that look.
I really like Sasha Velour's, it's so beautifully made and really unique to her
Ra’Jah O’Hara in all that purple is so gorgeous to me ✨ and her just tossing that wig into the center of the stage is one of the best moments of that reunion
Katya as a burn victim.
Eureka’s look for the Season 10 reunion
I don’t know if a fake wooden leg counts as a look… if it does… Alaskaaaaa
Kornbread "The Snack" Jeté.
DETOX ICUNT
Bianca’s, season 7, passing on the crown, look. Sparkling splendor
There is far too much Tammie Brown erasure in here. The yellow blazer with the too-low headband showing off the receding hairline? Iconic is the only way to describe it
Yuhua, no contest
I thought this was a preview of tonight’s episode and I was like WTF is Kalorie doing there
Alaskas red bikini look
Eureka season 10 reunion look, plastic teeth season 11 reunion look,
Sasha Colby said "bitch you thought"
Yvie coming in a bathrobe and with her hair up in a towel was HIGH camp
 Yvie’s Bath-time look.
Detox has never done wrong at a reunion
I’d like for Yuhua to come back for all stars please and thank you.
Kornbread's look was fun campy drag and such a sweet tribute to Willow and her friendship
Crystal Methyd’s Scrooge
Plus that look was incredible! The Mohawk!
The way she was holding the candlestick the whole time. 😂
Honestly, the same.
Icon of innovation, Miss Yuhua
I remember her look and she talked maybe twice for the whole reunion.
frrr

I’ve yet to see her not stunning, just beautiful.
For pretty much anything the answer to "What's your favourite \_\_\_\_\_?" is Detox
Glad someone said it! Unreal
![gif](giphy|l2JhuBUyxiu6MTH5m)
Created a runway theme!
That look lives rent free in my mind. It still takes up the space it deserves.
the rubber ducky earrings!!
As an answer to Rajah saying she doesn’t bathe
LITERALLY
“I quit drag, you’re welcome!” 💀
I know she was the villain (featuring Kameron Michaels) of this episode, but she looked SO. CORRECT.
👏👏👏 Tell the children (and walk them in nature)
I think it's during her final runway that she says *"I am the confident, complex, regal matriarch of a Russian mafia family, enjoying her last days on Earth before she is set ablaze by jealous relatives"*  And then she shows up to the reunion like THAT. I love her so fucking much.
Is this the look yall are gaggng for?
WHY DID I NOT PUT THAT TOGETHER..ICONIC
Never made that connection 💀 I had just seen the look popular amongst a few kids around that time… iirc GOTTMIK was one of them. He had worn it to a pool party in LA that summer
pls she was so bothered by that while lol
Shes amazing. My pick for the win both times 🫣
Are there more fashionable queens than Katya? Yes. Are there more beautiful queens than Katya? Yes. But are there more weirdly wonderful, hilarious, quirky, brilliant queens than Katya? Hell no. She is amazing in all the wrong, but oh so right, ways. I adore her. I would watch her do anything. She is compelling in a way that can't be contained.
no it's her gray scale look
I was wondering the same thing because the AS2 reunion look was nothing to write home about
Oh oops Harvard is calling 🤪🤪
That was for the finale, no?
wait what do you mean? lolll
back in the day, live finale and reunion were one
I think that season they were one and the same but might be wrong.
Back in s5 the reunion and the finale were combined
I meant I was stupid for thinking it was the as2 one 🫣
loll, it's ok, but i'm more stupid because i don't understand the harvard joke lol
Wouldn’t that mean Harvard *isnt* calling?… genuine question.💚
lol this comment thread is the gift that keeps on giving.
it’s sarcasm
Lol I understand but the sarcasm is “I guess Harvard won’t be calling soon”- like the delusion that you thought they would.  The other way doesn’t make sense. Believe me I’ve analyzed it, although I’m well aware that it’s not serious haha.
Is that like an ancient dildo?
Did you see Poppy in the comments 😂
Until I can no longer walk (that fucking duck)
Anetra woke up today and decided to wear our pussies out 🥵
I love how she tagged the sun in her photo
Seeing Asian trade representation is my passion
Filipino here and I need to find out where in the Philippines her ancestors are from to see if I'm theoretically allowed to free his willy.
I don't really have a read for you please just fuck me
Anetra is so hot. OMG, am I a lesbian?!
I am looking respectfully
This is why Loosey gave us permission to let loose 🤤
Anetra has me heated 🥵  ![gif](giphy|FWZ1OyaAtsnQs|downsized)
He better walk that fucking DICK over here. Lord have mercy on my hole... I mean soul. 👀😳  🥵
I'm just a hole 😔
Sweating, crying, throwing up and screaming
Fuck
Well, I wasn’t thirsty a second ago, but now I am! Damn, girl!! 😍🥵
As hot as IMO Anetra is, I think this is the hottest for me.  YUMMY 😋
Hottest queens on drag race period. No one even close
Reject me so I can move on already.
Anetra is up there in the Top 1 of most attractive contestants of all time

Not to objectify, but totally to objectify... trade.
trade of the season and for the rest of my LIFE

UUUGGGHHH I'M 💦💦💦
Yes
Daddyyyy
Two hours?! What wonderful news!
*faints*
My Wiily has been FREED!!
I would like to thank Miss Anetra for continuing to reinforce my bisexuality with content like this. She really is the full package 🥵 (minus the singing)
I had a dream last night where Anetra and Sasha were having sex out of drag back stage before the crowning... do with that info what you will. lol
Does anyone have the number for a good plumber? Because my basement…FLOODED.
Not me trying to like the IG heart
Imagine being this hot and someone else calling themselves the trade of the season
yum
You looking all hot and shit
My basement? A pond full of ducks.
I see many comments about how cute and hot Anetra is and tbh i can’t agree more on that
Hot.
Marry me!
There's a lot of negative space on the top of the photo. Anetra could've placed the angle lower so that we could see her whole body sitting. Just saying.
Just what is she trying to do to me with this photo? 😛
MAN I wish I was a gay man so I could seduce and/or marry Anetra :(
Can I get a handsome asian man like Anetra to fck me pls damn 🤤🤤🤤🤤
That long ass dick didn't have any lube on it, so it felt like he was rubbing his wood in my hole and starting a bonfire. All I could do was bury my face into the pillow and scream until he finished coming in my ass for the fourth time. Then the wetness. His thrust. His tongue, deep into my ass, licking all of my anal walls. He sucked and licked and slurped and tongued, going from my pussy to my ass and then back up again. He pressed deep down into my pussy, shaking his head back and forth. I felt the facial stub all over my—mhmm—I felt the facial stub all over my pussy and it felt *glorious*.
After the riggory of night 2 of WrestleMania and this past trash Raw I may skip SmackDown altogether and tune in to just the reunion. I usually record Drag Race on my dvr b/c SmackDown is a live show so I rather watch that live. But they don’t deserve my viewership 😂
Panties have been dropped
Traaaaaaaaaaaade of the season and our hearts 😍
And here I thought I had nothing to watch today. 🌈💖🌈💖🌈
Will it be on WOW?
IT’S TWO HOURS LONG?!/!!/$/)/?!/ LET ME GET THE POPCORN OMG
Anetra, please!
Sasha Colby giving me hope that anetra might really be a lesbian 🥲🥲 give a doll a chance anetra /s /s /s
Is it possible to get pregante from a photo?
Looking respectfully, thank yew.
Anetra is so damn fine 😍
He has no business being so dam hot 😥
Why is Anetra so fucking hot! 🤤
Life is so unfair. SO unfair…
Think about it, if she loses, there's a higher chance she will be opening an onlyfans in the future. Isn't that what everybody wants?
He is fine as hell… upsets me I will never have a taste 👅
She’s wearing my pussy outtttt
Lick
Really glad that she gained a little weight after shooting DR (she still looked great) but she was soo skinny! She looks soo good now😍

Duly noted

LMAOOOO what is this??!
WHAT IS THIS IM CRYING
🇵🇭❤️🇵🇭 our (half) Filipina Queen 👑
Anetra seems genuinely kind; she's funny and enjoys the drama without being involved. She's talented as fuck as a performer, had the best lip sync in the franchise (imo) and made the second-best workroom outfit on the show (Utica = 🏅). I agree several of her runways were very similar and a couple were hard a hard boot, but it's either a money or time issue because she's proven her skill and taste level in both design challenges.    Hotness is a whole compilation of things, not just the way your face looks.
You sound so envious lolol Poor thing, hopefully you'll have a glow up someday and not be this bitter about attractive people
I def wouldn’t go THIS far . But Anetra def benefits from being a very attractive man .

Thanks!  Why does this make her more attractive 😩
If so, they can be removed. 😉
lol love this comment.
lol true that! the content of the dream was much more specific and explicit (w/ Anetra coming up to Sasha saying she's been watching her all these years and finally get to confess to her. Being able to perform w/ her brought them even closer together...) But i'm too scared if i write the whole thing i'll be ban on this sub for sexual content lol
Modern pop culture, diva
This subreddit is so icky like it wasn’t that deep y’all get off my d. TEAM COLBY
My compliment on her looks should be left in my head while countless comments suggesting they f\*ck/top her are completely fine. ok
I literally just complimented how good she looks. Didnt call her anorexic or obese or unhealthy. Explain why thats weird? Im genuinely curious.
*Bob has left the chat*
Same goes for the pussy
I think on the Roscoe’s or something he said he was half filipino and a mix of Japanese and some european

lol you crack me up![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sweat_smile)
Lol you’re wild if you think I’m concerned with what you think of my good looks 😂
Your “compliment” on her looks is couched in some weird comment about being glad she “gained weight” because she apparently looked “soo skinny.”  “Anetra looks great” is a compliment. “I’m glad Anetra gained weight” is not.  There’s your free lesson for the day.
The fact that you need it explained means you won't understand anyway
not the princess blocky
Yes, but there are many ethnic groups within the Philippines. If she has the same as mine, we're in trouble, lol.
I think I found the 🚬 that got Mistress banned
![gif](giphy|darj2i0ydEarFSl8Nc|downsized)
Dude, lol I seriously would like to know. If im being ignorant, let me know. explain where Im wrong. I cant change if you cant explain
Take a breath, love
try Ao3, lol
I’m not sure what I’m more confused about: your random troll attitude or how your comment makes any sense at all.
Hi, it's ok i've been in the same boat before and my friend corrected me so i learned. I think within the last decade, it's now establish in our culture that commenting on someone's weight is seen as gauche/tacky/rude. I grew up in the early 2000's when this kind of off the cuff comment on weights/appearances were much more brutal (America's Next top model, American Idol ect...) But i think the new understanding is that it's no longer ok to do that. I mean it's very kitchen table talk that maybe you can do w/ your close friends but not in a public forum. I hope this help. Everyone is constantly growing and learning and sometimes we need a bit help from others to see that's all.
Hey, thanks for your response. Dont know why the other person couldn't follow through lol...   Yeah, I've come to terms with how comments are in bad taste when regarding weight and appearance. I didn't realize these comments are tantamount to what I thought was genuine commendation if it's under the same umbrella... But yeah, I guess I was in the wrong then. If anything, the progress is definitely positive, just wish people weren't so snappy about it lol. I also don't live in the US, so culture is another factor too. I think we're similar in age. Antm was definitely brutal, although there are some obvious overlaps with Mistress' attitude and 2000s tv if Im speaking sincerely. Thank you for your explanations again, appreciate it☺️
So then make it make sense, Mary lolol
Yeah grandma, we all understand that part… What does the person getting Mistress banned on twitter/Instagram have to do with anything? It’s so random and out of nowhere lol
I’ve really come to appreciate how Salina weaponized her lack of taste on the runway. Pure 🏕️.
Slaplina EsDaddy
I wish the boots were as big as the gloves. Like the boots that vulcano wore on Dr espana
She better win that golden boot
I live for this lewk
this was definitely up there with her lamppost look for  the golden boot. all this was giving me was sex doll sleep paralysis demon
![gif](giphy|BZlNhp9L5WINi)  Lol people shit on her runway package yet the same designers worked on the other girls’ costumes and outfits that some of y’all love 🥸
Her looks were atrocious lmao my god. Ill fitting and ugly.
I don't hate that look though?  Honestly, Salina and Sasha were the only Queens who had looks worthy of a glove runway. You could tell the theme was gloves looking at them and they both looked good.
Periodt
Yassss
That’s the point, it’s a style issue, she has the resources and materials but goes a bit left field
I think this look is not only very good, but it was the best of the night (maybe save for Sasha’s).
Oh, I don’t either. I actually love Salina’s runway package. But I would not in a million years call it *tasteful.*
One thing I respect about Salina is that she was just herself and didn't care if her runways weren't polished and that kinda made me like them more lol  Her money ball is my guilty pleasure look
That part, they were the top two for me that week.
Really? It looks like fruit cocktail thats been arranged into a face to me 😊
Queen of the people!
We love a queen who's conscious of the economy for others!
I’ve met Lawrence (casually after a local show, not at a meet and greet). She’s lovely and a hoot!
That’s actually really cheap, at least where I am
I paid about £4 I think to meet Lawrence on the purple reign tour and honestly was the best meet and greet experience I’ve had. So chatty and welcoming
![gif](giphy|ozFFLHaispsPHfXJQU|downsized)  Lawrence Chaney: A Legend
Tammie Brown did a free meet and greet when I saw her live but unfortunately I had taken an edible (as God intended before seeing Tammie) and was afraid I would seem too weird. Her show was also the best Ru girl show I’ve ever seen hands down.
I went to her purple reign tour and it was only £5 more for a meet and greet. She was lovely, and her prices are so fair!
I met Lawrence at dragcon where it wasn’t as cheap to meet her but it was sooo worth it. You can tell she loves her fans and just wants to connect with as many people as she can. A true winner our Ms. chAneY 🤧❤️ p.s. I’m definitely paying it again to see her this year at dragcon! ✨
I love Lawrence. At DragCon, I told her that when she won, I felt so happy and proud, as if I were her actual parent. Without missing a beat, she told me that I was. 😂
I met Lawrence on the United Kingdolls tour and she is so far above and beyond her peers. I could not have had a better experience with her, especially in comparison to her co-stars who did not want to be there whatsoever and made it abundantly clear. I walked in a stan of every girl except Lawrence and left obsessed with only her.
Mistress’ was $15 lol
I love her
Local RVA fan! There are dozens of us!
She’s like the modern day princess Diana
I’ve had the pleasure of meeting Lawrence once at a bar after a show, and she is amazing. If anyone is interested I would totally recommend.
Hard Candy events is the best! They bring the Drag Race queens and Dragula monsters on tours to a handful of cities and it doesn’t cost an arm and a leg to see or meet them. I’ve been to tons of their events here in Kansas City and met queens like Brooke Lynn Hytes, Trinity the Tuck, Jan, Crystal Methyd, Pangina, and more. Anetra will be here in a couple weeks!
Scottish royalty over here trying to turn that frown upside down!
A sensible 7 dollars
That's wild all the American Ru girls charge at least $300
I love Lawrence. She seems like a sweetheart.
Girl do it, $7 is worth it
We love a budget queen during a cost of living crisis.
Adore her. Genuinely an incredible person and super talented  This woman is the only person that comes up when I look up Lawrence Cheney but imagine it’s MOTHER in her monster mash runway  ![gif](giphy|TRDqKzCONcxs7jK9zS|downsized)
If you add another %2, she'll give you a handjob
![gif](giphy|bWUnPeDXzFo9sOwbDn)
Wait I'm confused it says $32 so why are you saying it's only $7
Does it come with chicken nuggets?
Icon!
She's a blast to meet in person.
Compare this to a set of queens who charged $200 for the meet and greet
Sasha Colby is doing hers for like 45 cad in Montreal it’s a stealllllllll honestly.
I wanted to do the meet and greet for Trixie/Katya when they were out here, but it was like $100 per person. Couldn’t justify it for a picture in a chair next to them lol.
That’s amazing. I bought 3 meet and greet tickets for Jinkx’s upcoming tour and it was literally more than my mortgage payment.
Honestly, she is doing herself a disservice charging so little.
The girls are bargaining.
How can we not Stan? The winner of one of the best seasons of Drag Race, who chooses to treat fans with respect and not rip them off.
Right next to me and the day before my bday😭💜💜
I guess not as popular as the rest of the queens.
Queen of the people!!
What a steal! Defs worth it for that price!
If she’s in her Pennywise costume, totally worth it
Pangina meet and greet was $15 last summer. Absolute steal. This is even better!
We’re going to that one too! We saw the price and couldn’t say no, especially to our Queen! 💜
Noble pricing.
Rose did it for free here in PH but illegally kekw
I came here to say that, thank you.
Speaking of cheap I saw Pangina (with support from Dosa Cat, who was amazing, and Mutha Tucka) for £7.50 in Glasgow and god, it was worth at least 3x that.
You were afraid that Tammie Brown would think you were too weird? Man, you must have been serious fucking high lmao
She was really kind & sweet to me when I must of come across as an ABSOLUTE weirdo!    I was helping out on a Tranimals photoshoot & I got to staple gun a taxidermy pheasant carcass to her wig cap.  She was a trooper despite being GREATLY unnerved by the sound of a tagging gun going off by her head.    All of this was being done while I was basically silent & had uncontrollable facial spasms that made me look INSANE.    I had a serious COPD flair up, had damaged my throat & lungs & wasn’t able to speak much at all.  My immune system went crazy & it caused Bell’s palsy.    But she wasn’t freaked out by me at all!
> afraid i would seem too weird   But wouldn’t that just make the queen of mars love you more?! i kinda think i’d only want to meet tammie while high as fuck honestly 😂 it’d be amazing
I can totally believe this. Though I'd totally love more info
She charged 20$ when people thought she was Euerka lmaoo
Yeah, Sasha’s was $20 extra. Lawrence deserves better.
‘twas $25 last night for a meet and greet w/ MIB.Still a steal tho!
Because it’s spelled Chaney 😂
The general admission is 25 but if you upgrade to 32 (7 dollars more) you also get a meet and greet
Not if yer a vegan!
You think $25 is expensive for a drag show with the winner of RPDRUK?
What kind of question is this, what theatre/comedy/any show do you get to have a private chat with the cast included in the price? Entitled as hell, Lawrence is making it cheap when they could just follow suit with how expensive some people are and that still isn’t good enough for you. How negative!
No. They are an additional charge, and vary depending on the Queen.  I did a meet and greet with Icesis Couture and she only charged $10 Canadian extra, which I felt was very reasonable.   $25 is not that much more than regular cover charge to get into a club.
Meet n greets can easily cost hundreds of dollars. $25 for a performance ticket is EXPENSIVE? Even movies cost like $15 these days
Not guaranteed, no. I'm guessing you mean like if you buy the VIP ticket package or something? If so - some do, some don't and its extra for the M&G  I went VIP for Trixie and that included the M&G (best money I ever spent, she was delightful) - but for other queens touring near me the VIP package has been like just queue jumping/ a lanyard/ bar access/ a seat in the first 3 rows kind of things,  and the M&G is then "an optional upgrade!" - usually between £15 and £50
Wow! She's coming to a bar near me this summer at meet and greet is like $90 US
That’s crazy! In Tokyo I’m going to Pangina, Raja and Denali’s show and it was 35,000 yen ($300ish) for meet and greet VIP.
My friends and I met Awhora, Lawrence, Taycw and Krystal on this tour where Krystal replaced Bimini fairly last minute. Tayce went to the bathroom during our meet meaning we were stranded with the remaining queens for MUCH longer than expected.  A’whora and Krystal would not stop gossiping between themselves and turning away from us to have their own conversations. When we did speak they complained excessively about their management hurrying them, their flight landing late and the venue not being to their standard. My friend also said to A’whora “I heard you changed up your make-up recently!” to make conversation about her new mug, to which A’whora seemed to unexpectedly take offence and replied very snarkily that that’s what drag queens do. As for Tayce, I have no judgement to make as I didn’t get a chance to talk to her. The second she returned from the bathroom security took our photo together and sent us away.  However Lawrence had plenty to say, talking to us about our outfits, our jobs, the tour so far, how excited she was to see the country etc. If she was as tired and bored as the rest of them she never let it show. She was an absolute ray of sunshine and I’d 1000% meet her again and pay for future gigs.
That’s funniest shit I ever heard
Ohh makes sense thanks
I think it was about £25 or there about for meet & greet but Pangina was already in the UK for drag con or something so I imagine that factored in to her doing a wee mini tour that was so inexpensive
Thank you for responding! I'll deffo make my way to see Lawrence some time. It's about 165 mile round trip to get to Glasgow which is a pain in the arse and the pocket but I try and get there a few times a year.   Hope you have a nice weekend!
I got to meet both Awhora and Tayce. Awhora was a little bit intimidating. She's very sexy and has an intense presence! I think she can smell fear, so it's best to go in confident, which I did not. Lol.  Tayce is drop dead gorgeous. I thought she was super warm and friendly, very accommodating, and really went out of her way to give fans a great experience!

They probably are taking the half hour of Untucked and giving it to the “main show”

Time to let loose
Gotta make up for Poppy, Robin and Aura having no arcs because of MTV's idiocy
The first 30 minutes needs to be unseen footage of Robin, Amethyst, Aura and Jax.  I'm curious if Robin's invisible edit will come up in the reunion. I don't see her mentioning it but maybe someone else will.  And I'm not being shady to the others who finished in the 10th to 16th range. Irene had a lot of screen time for being in 1 episode. Sugar had plenty (though I actually think could have ended up going further than Spice). And Poppy seemingly doesn't care.
Yoww what. Damn I’m so excited for this to air on wow+ later.
Luxx is gonna do a dissertation on the other girls
The fact that I am excited to see EACH AND EVERY queen come back is a testament to how great the girls were this season.
And if you’re watching on Amazon, you’ll get to watch both hours of the reunion next week!
Just two hours of Mistress and Loosey going at it, it’s what we deserve 💀
I have to wait till tomorrow cos I live in Ireland :(
I knew I bought two bottles of wine today for a reason.
Expect more filler than Venus D. Lite
Well there’s 16 damn contestants, they all got to get a segment. Still looking forward to some T
Do we know if they filmed it before or after they filmed the finale?
Maybe for everyone else, but possibly not for us Prime Video girls who didn’t get the Blame it on the edit episode until Sunday. 😭
They said "Look, we really hurt the poor homosexuals this season... let's give them the treat of hours of drama!" and thankyou, we deserve this
So does anyone else have them purchased thru YouTube? What time do they usually put the episode on there
What for UK as well? Or do we have to wait until 6am tomorrow
![gif](giphy|3AbRB07sKSpJsVJYbs)
9:00 PM - 11:00 PM EST.
When will it be on wow for uk viewers?
Why?
Wait so is this not going to be a typical reunion where they are all on the main finale stage or? The story they posted didn’t give any clues or “sneak peaks. I really hope the producers don’t cut out juicy bits though I never keep my hopes up with this show anymore.
Shouldn’t you have to leave the set before you have a reunion?
This is my first live reunion. How many days is the reunion taped before the finale?
Thanks for the warning. I usually watch it at midnight Friday when it shows up on Prime (although last week it didn’t appear until Sunday night!). Maybe I’ll wait until Saturday morning.
On craves schedule it’s still only an hour long, does this mean we’ll get the second hour later??? Or like what’s happening here? I’m praying the schedule is just wrong because I don’t want to waaaiiit
Where are y'all watching it?   I usually wait for it to air and watch it on a Saturday. But I'd like to watch live 😬🙏✨
Ma’am we wanted the tea, the whole tea and nothing but the tea, so MTV is giving us tea and cakes
I heard that Luxx and Loosey get Sugar and Spice extra loose
Just went through 7 months of unemployment and felt this comment so much.
![gif](giphy|dh9I74FoLu1jy)  Bitch same
Poppy is that u
Damn do we need to start a discord for outta work drag race fans?
Me a SAHM also only knowing what day it is for the same reason
I literally JUST started my new job this Tuesday after weeks of being unemployed, this slapped me harder than Ru slapped Asia
A couple weeks ago I actually forgot it was Drag Race Day until I saw this sub because every day of the week had mushed together.  Just had an interview though, crossing my fingers.
Omg this was me after I graduated I had no idea what day it was besides Fridays
I'm employed and only know what day it is because of Drag Race 😂
Saaaame! Job hunting can be soul crushing, Drag Race is one of the only things keeping me sane lol
![gif](giphy|CIBBy09KxZAw8)
Me, employed, still using drag race to calculate the day of the week
same here omg
real
Omg literally me too
That’s the best 😅😅
I have a reminder on my phone every Friday to stay off social media because I usually can't watch until Saturday, but with the way spoilers have been popping up everywhere, I should probably just throw my phone in the lake.
It’s a reunion☺️☺️☺️☺️ not the finale
Same, I can’t watch until tomorrow evening so u might walk to the harbour and just toss my phone in haha
If you want to watch at 9 on crave go the section that says On Air and go to crave channel two. You can't pause or anything but I do that when I'm ready to watch.
I watch on Crave and that was my question as well
You can watch live on Crave!
I don’t trust the reunion to be making up any ground to that end.  I feel like anything that could actually boil down to breaking the fourth wall (ie production had us doing xyz) then they won’t deal with it.
The first 30 minutes needs to be solely Irene
Is that what happened? Went to my friends last week to watch it for the first time and she purchases from Amazon…. We spent an hour trying to find it and ended up streaming from some bootleg website that probably gave her a virus
same!! im from germany ugh
I love Crystal
before
I purchased through Amazon, but they usually had episodes up as soon as it finished airing for me
Oh never mind I read this wrong haha eyesight must be playing up lmao
9:00 PM - 11:00 PM ESTitties
Bruh. It's been EDT for nearly a month. It starts at 8 pm EDT
I think we might be getting some "new" material from stuff that was cut in the earlier episodes, sort of like how the earlier seasons had these "countdown to the crown" episodes with exclusive clips.
Because we are #blessed
I’m assuming it’s just like last year’s reunion and not the non-reunion we got for s13.
What are you talking about? It is 2 hours, confirmed on the MTV schedule.
Usually it's after but someone on another thread mentioned that this time it was taped before the finale, which kinda sucks. The scorned finalists that didn't make the top 2 at the finale usually give some of the best reunion performances.
i’m kinda lowkey scared bc im into like 5 months of unemployment at this point 😔
Nurse 🚑🚨🏨
This should NOT have made me laugh so hard  ![gif](giphy|26n6Gx9moCgs1pUuk|downsized)

Same! I count the days by how many left till DR!
Congrats on the new gig 🥳🥳🥳
Aaah!! Good luck 🤗  ![gif](giphy|ngzl0LAbCsRQLYOhvD|downsized)
Good luck!
Yesssss!! I'm hanging on by some hot glue like LaLa's bag dress(?) outfit(?) thingy.
Wow, how did you all know the queens throw their phones into lakes for the finale!? Spoiler alert!
turn my phone off, and THROWWWW it in the LAAAAKE and I'll be..... 2 steps on the water (do do do do do...)
Let me be dramatic about reunion spoilers 😩
I hate that I’m just finding this out now after an entire season of constantly refreshing the app at 9:30 until the episode came up 😭😭😭
Is there a Crystal this season? I don’t even remember
Do you know the time for Amazon
Maybe I’ll do Amazon in the future. I feel like YouTube takes a bit and then I fall asleep
Thank you. I don’t know why I got downvoted.
Not for me. 😅
Ooh yes please
Why the hell are they airing it four hours earlier than usual
Girl, Im coming up on 3 years. 😭 you will get thru this <3
Ppl really do this though... Like I made a *prediction* about what place a queen was going to go out and someone was like "don't post spoilers" when they're the one spoiling it by revealing it's a spoiler and I had no idea lmao.
SENT
Amazon is usually around 11/12ish on Friday night central time. Although last week wasn’t until Sunday night for some reason 😩
8pm eastern time. Same as always.
Yeah. You have to be really careful. I think this sub has done a decent job of weeding out most spoilers but I had to stop participating a lot in the live threads. The last straw was in as4 when like 2 min before Naomi showed the lipstick she picked someone was like “i heard she said Manila”. Like what pleasure does one get from doing that; and/or what contribution did they think they were making. So annoying.
I mean apart from the season 9 top 2 I think every top 2 was very predictable just judging from the edit of the season as a whole IMO. If you're guess for season 11 was Brooke and yvie top 2 and they going to deliver us a sickening lip sync and people complain about spoilers it would be a bit weird.  Like I doubt it will be different this season either since I am sure wow was pissed at the pact that ruined their planned top 2 back in season 9 lol
8 pm EST is in 6 hours-
“I heard” is speculation, or gossip. Spoilers are more outright “she is sending Manila home”, you can’t really be mad if someone was just speculating
I think they would've liked an Aquaria/Asia top 2 for season 10, Symone/Gottmik for 13, and Willow/Angeria for 14 tbh. Also, WOW was definitely the opposite of pissed at what happened in season 9. One of the most iconic moments of the whole franchise happened, and they've kept the lip sync tournament ever since, so clearly they like it.
The post is saying the reunion will be 2 hours long. Not in 2 hours.
I agree with Asia and maybe also gottmik although hoping for her winning a lipsync to get there was definitely an uphill battle. Also I am not sure about Angeria either I feel like in the back half of the season she just faded into the background. For me personally LC was a bit more exciting than the others but at the end of the day I only cared about Willow   Oh no don't get me wrong the rose petal moment they certainly loved but I very much doubt they wanted it to happen in round 1 and not as the big finale.
OH 💀 MY BAD
My point is that they like the lip sync tournament so much that they're okay not having the queens they want in the final 2
Reading is fundamental
I also misread it as the reunion airing in 2 hours lol
I dunno I feel like that would be kinda awkward and shitty for the eliminated queen. They can share the looks that they didn’t get to wear on the runway on their socials and I think that works just as well. I think it would be a distraction too like, what happens when an eliminated queen walks before a competing queen and her look is just better like… that would be super awkward as well.
only the finale bc it makes sense idk it might be too overwhelming and confusing if all the queens did every runway
This brings to light a question I have: do the eliminated queens literally have to remained sequestered into their hotels in isolation for the remainder of filming, or are they actually allowed to return home?  I usually get the impression it’s the former, but sometimes I’ll hear something that makes it sound like they actually do go home. It would be quite depressing to be first out and then spend a month and a half ruminating in isolation.  If MTV wanted a gay “destination night,” it would be fun if they had a spin-off show where all the eliminated queens live in a house together for the remainder of filming. It would be fun to see their reaction to which queen joins them each week, and it would be a way for all the queens to remain on TV in some capacity for the full season. They could call it Porkchop Mansion or whatever
I think it could work on a season where the eliminated queens sticking around is part of the season’s gimmick (think the chocolate bar, but revamped) where the council of eliminated queens all get one chance to save a queen from elimination.  So for instance, this imaginary season, the eliminated queens remain as a council that shows up every runway. The remaining queens get a normal runway. And then the eliminated get a quick runway (so none of the “im giving you X realness in this gown made out of construction paper” talking. Think those super fast runways we got in some episodes like back in season 5) and then take a seat off-stage like they do in the Talent Show. And much like the chocolate bar, after Ru eliminates a queen, the council gets to intervene once a season. Maybe for an insane lipsync, or just to avoid a frontrunner from going home if they feel like it.  Basically only in a season like that do I think we could get away with eliminated queens doing the runway. Otherwise, it makes no sense outside of the finale.
No
No, they paid a ton of money for those outfits and should get to display them where they want if they have been eliminated from the show.
I think it would be cool if they gave thier own segment in untucked or a completely different show where we would get to see all of the eliminated queens looks and maybe rupaul could just judge the looks and give out cash prizes
So, hear me out on this:  1. Eliminated contestants get to walk one by one in a group, end-of-the-fashion-show style. No narration, no confessionals, no fun stuff, just "here's the outfit". This allows them to display the garment while still keeping the runway "special" for the competitive contestants. (Who get a solo walk, narration, character moments, etc.) 2. Eliminated contestants then sit stage right like they do for the talent show, and react to stuff. Cheer, clap, shout, wag their fingers, roll their eyes, etc.  This means that the first out gets a little treat: she gets a solo runway, and she gets a lot of attention reacting to stuff. Irene DuBois would be *great* at it, no? Miss Vanjie sitting there all season long cheering for her sisters and honking when they do stupid shit?
It could be cool to have their runways air as part of untucked or a web series. To make it economical they'd probably need to film all of a queen's remaining looks the day after their elimination. It would be weird for the queens to stay on set just to walk one runway every two days.
I can see that... Sure... It could stir the pot between some girls... A cunty move... I support the idea..
I don't know how many would agree to get all in drag, sometimes with very elaborate costumes, for very little screentime.   España did it well for season 2. At the reunion, all the queens featured a look that they didn't get to show, like they literally do the runway walk, but really wanted to and then the queens vote for their favourite and they win something.
I love how Canada does it -- all the eliminated queens get to come back for the final runway. It's a really nice touch
I honestly wish they’d go with smaller casts & the previous all stars format for the regular seasons
YES please.
Isn't there a season of ANTM that did that? The eliminated contestants still walked the runways and whoever won returned. Or am I hallucinating?
I would love it. When I think of the time and funds the Queens expend, it's wrong  that they don't get to present their looks.
I’d love it. Maybe even at the very start of untucked
I've always wanted a supplement to the season where the eliminated girls can showcase the looks on stage but we can just look at them on YouTube
They usually return home within a few days of being eliminated, but there are exceptions. (I believe that for Vs. The World seasons, they are allowed out of sequester but remain in the hotel, because these seasons are short and they need to be present for the finale and, like, they aren't going to fly Pangina home to Thailand only to fly her back to Europe six days later.)
Porkchop Mansion!!! You should trademark this before WOW/MTV steals your idea.
They definitely go home. Naysha Lopez famously went all the way home and had just gotten home when they called her up to bring her back.
I would watch that.
I believe they leave after they are eliminated but I think sometimes they leave in groups. Like every week the girls who are eliminated leave, but I’m not sure
Yes, a Ponderosa-like series would be amazing.
Like the Jury House from Big Brother
That would be a cool twist for an All Stars season.
So a jury thing, but better. I had this idea before, “the season of votes” For a election year.
I thought they had to stay the whole time since spoilers could just track who came home when and be like "oh I see Irene is back online... that didn't last long..."
Honestly I’d love if someone pitched it to them
That's exactly what the spoilerinas do, and at this point I don't know that production has a choice. (Like, imagine being the poor PA who'd have to keep Dahlia Sin in a hotel room without a phone for six weeks...)
![gif](giphy|N9m1jdiMUpAt9oRy7T|downsized)
Because Ru chose Lawrence Chaney, who also did a great job 🤷🏻‍♂️
I think Lawrence is the one that made more sense for what the prize was, I love Bimini but Lawrence definitely has a bigger personality so production probably put that into consideration when picking the winner
![gif](giphy|Qjyf7sUQNGjpW5e3f1)
Because of this moment  ![gif](giphy|dVPhRxLN7KRAAIXqUu|downsized)
Lawrence has proven a lot since the show why she is the winner. Ru made a great decision in hindsight and clearly saw how special Lawrence was during filming.
Honestly, during the season, I was upset Bimini lost as well. I liked Lawrence but LOVED Bimini. However, in the years after UK2, I have grown to love Lawrence even more and appreciate her run more. She still held her own after being unable to do drag for MONTHS while others had some opportunities to practice and get some gigs in. ~~Plus idk something changed with Bimini and I don't love her as much as I previously did~~.   I may have been upset in the beginning, but in the long run, I am so glad that Lawrence won, and can't wait for her to kill All Winners 2.
![gif](giphy|lC5v7W0xfmgzPlSHVc)  Cope. Seethe.
Because of a Legend. You know, like The Loch Ness Monster.
because lawrence was the rightful winner next question
Cause she isn’t her  ![gif](giphy|Ptrfq6PQFipb224TuD)
My belief is that Ru saw Bimini wasn't as committed to drag. Bimini is very talented, but they quit drag like a year after being the most popular drag queen in the UK. Call Naomi, because the bitch has no legs.
![gif](giphy|Dqo3aH1j6OlFjrQjKy)  This look
Lawrence spilled the tea at Roscoe's. Something along the lines of, she dominated the first half of the season so hard that they cut some of her best stuff to give other queens spotlight. It kinda was the Lawrence show, and I think that's when RuPaul made up her mind. And then the pandemic happened.
bimini was never gonna win that season lawrence opens her mouth and rupaul laughs and you know the golden rule of drag race
I came here to say “Because Lawrence did,” but I see that’s been taken care of 😊  I ADORE Bimini, she would have been a great winner, but Lawrence deserved it. Both phenomenal queens on a phenomenal season.
I mean the winner was funny, sexy as hell, a lyricist, and actress also. Now that’s just the way the sing, sang , song!
She didn't win because she wasn't RuPaul's favorite
I think the pacing of the season was the issue here. Up until the COVID pause it was all Lawrence but when they came back Bimini was super strong for much of the second half so it might have appeared that she completely eclipsed Lawrence. At least that’s how I remember it.  I could be wrong.
Lawrence was incredible the whole season. She deserved the win. Also drag race isn’t about being sexy it’s about talent so Bimini being sexy is a mute point lol. Also if things were predetermined and it was all up to Ru’s favorite Luxx would win this current season which (if you’ve read spoilers) isn’t happening. Because Ru is obsessed with Luxx lol. If you rewatch the season Lawrence made RuPaul crack TF up every fucking single episode and that’s basically all you need to do. Make Ru laugh, serve up some trauma porn and serve sickening looks! And Lawrence did all that.   Is there some riggery? Absolutely. But to say Bimini deserved the crown over Lawrence is silly. Look at the two careers after the show in comparison.
she wasn't ru's fave. that's the winner (within those of comparable achievement) everytime  Edit the only one I think that is not true for is Violet. I think Ginger may have been her fave but production wanted Violet
Because it's Ru's show, not yours! - or mine, cause I would have crowned Tayce ( but Lawrence and Bimini also did amazing!)  ![gif](giphy|IS2GNGXmqRWuTGK5qX)
Lawrance was more like the mainstream idea of drag. Drag race queens in uk have more media exposition than the US girls. Bimini was too punk/kinda "trashy" (in a good way)/anarchist character.
Ngl, watching that season it felt like they'd already chosen laurence for the win and it didn't really matter what happened.  As a brit, I'd also say they had ALOT of pressure to crown a non-English queen on S2 and with everything going on at the time in UK I think they preplanned a Scottish winner. Its probably why they gave Ellie so many praises and passes, they wanted one of them to win.  Saying all that, laurence still hella talented and did well that season, but I personally agree bimini should've won.
"No shade, but..."
not these defensive ass comments 💀💀
Starting this off by saying Lawrence is amazing and I love her.   BUT - Wasn’t there tea that for DRUKS2 crowning it was between Lawrence and Bimini but because they had filmed S3 already and their frontrunner (Victoria) was self-eliminated - they couldn’t crown Bimini and Krystal Versace as two fashion queens back to back.  Ie the OG plan was to crown Bimini S2 (fashion queen) and Victoria S3 (big queen/AFAB) but because Victoria injured herself they switched it around to give it to Lawrence S2 (big queen) and Krystal would be the fashion queen winner S3.  Not to say Lawrence didnt deserve the crown - they both did for S2 - but also not to deny this is an incredibly produced TV show
Because Lawrence deserved it just as much and it was Ru’s choice
lawrence would've 100% have won if it wasn't for the break, bimini was lucky they had it. also we didn't get to learn about bimini like.. at all, whereas we learned sooo much about lawrence. now was lawrence my winner pick? no she wasn't, but neither way bimini tbf🤭 both ate tho
Gifs you can hear.
He chose Lawrence before the show started and gave her preferential judging all season.
Exactly this
It’s a Moo point. The point is Moo. (Cow’s opinion — doesn’t matter)
whose show is it again?
Are you the judge or is rupaul the judge?
girl everyone in replies draggin u, just accept ur opinion is trash and u thought u ate but u didn’t
Why even bother with the challenges if it's already predetermined?
Arent we all judges really?
What a cringe comment lol
You act as if Lawrence did horribly. Sure, Bimini picked up steam in the post-lockdown episodes, but Lawrence did fantastic in the first half and I would argue deserved her wins.
Can I see your source that this crowning was predetermined? Thanks!
To make money off advertising?
it’s a tv show before it’s a competition, you can’t forget that
cause it's a tv show ??  all these girlies should know by now it's a competition second, reality show first lol.
Well we certainly all judged you
girl u are the one being cringe w this lawrence hate tf 💀
Lawrence was clearly the worst in the Rusical episode. She would have lost the lipsynch and gone home in second without the favoritism.
It has never been more obvious that Ru has a massive favoritism for a contestant than this series.
Womp womp
Have you watched a single UK season? This is nothing new. The person who won is who Ru wanted to win. That's all.
Makes the whole thing a bit redundant as a viewer, no?
I'm not the one in charge of the show 🤷🏿‍♂️
It's a tv show, not a padge. And even padges get pulled. Just enjoy the entertainment. I find it easier to view drag as an art form instead of something that's meant to be competitive so it makes it more enjoyable for me to watch the show and have fun with it and not view it as something that's supposed to crown the absolute best drag queen. That would be impossible to determine objectively.
Well I think you should be ok!?!?

Love her. I actually liked her final lip sync more, but Couenne deserved to win the season.  Looking forward to seeing Athena on a vsTW or Global All Stars season. Susan too, after she buys some wigs.
Sasha has a beautiful heart.
I looove Sasha and I’m hoping she wins. I feel like even though the scoreboard is pretty even between them. She, for me, was just far and above the strongest competitor this season and she’s had so many superstar moments throughout and she even has the strongest story. But I also am still fine with it any way it ends up going lol.  Ultimately, thought, the crown won’t change the fact that she, and the rest of them for that matter, is an icon and a legend who has really shown the world that she is THAT girl that we knew she was.
There is no point for Sasha not to win and go on all stars....Anetra is young and pretty quiet....She can go on all stars and open up...Personality with her talent would be great on an all stars
Spiritual leader too…Rupaul was correct.
Of course, they’re all amazing. I just will liveeeee if it’s her
u can be quiet and still have personality
Not on a reality TV show...and I think Anetra is amazing...I'm just thinking about how reality TV cast....Can you see her on an all winners season? Or would she be ran over by all the personalityd
How you got two faces but you got three chins followed by the her body her choice just laid me the fuck out.
You know Bob’s been WAITING to rhyme Yolanda Saldivar with “salad bar”
"Hit this bitch so hard that Chevelle gonna feel it"  Bob's coming for EVERYBODY
I think it’s “You better keep an eye out for Salina” referencing beauty and the beat (But I gotta keep an eye out for Selener) - ty for doing this!
Obsessed with you including the bomo plug!
Thank you for doing the lawd’s work, henny.
Honestly Bob should just release an album full of diss tracks. You hear this Bob? It's me your manager
I know it’s the whole point of the post but when you transcribed the Selina ending i lost it 💀
y’all the [Let Loose!] sound bit after Lucy Laduca got me so good. 😂💀
Bob’s response was so much better than MIB’s original track.
There's a couple parts where I didnt know what the lyrics were, marked with an \[???\]. If u could help me out with that, as well as any other error I might've missed, lmk and I'll try to fix it. Thank u for coming by, this is my first time posting anything here!!
Thanks for doing that.  I just watched it with the captions.
The exclamation points are sending me
He actually messed up and said Salazar (Slytherin) instead of Saldivar (Yolanda).
Thank you!
Bob will always be my number 1 🤩
Prolonged snickering
I screamed
And preceded by 14 seasons just 1 one, so it’s a few lines in a row that are about numbers
Trinity was catching strays out of nowhere!
We need this album asap
Well it wouldn't have been complete without it, right?? ;)
I think I got 7 seconds into MIBs and then had to nope right out of there.
Couldn't top Jose, couldn't top Juan
I think I heard “bald bitch with a big ass bazooka”
no more [???]'s!! thank u for ur help!!
Bitch, you better keep an eye out for Salina!
Punctuation is important ;)
Totally get it. My husband and I listened to the whole thing because we wanted to know what Bob was responding to. Besides it being difficult to hear her lyrics, it just was so underwhelming and we just were waiting for it to end. Meanwhile with Bob’s we were smiling and laughing. Clever and clear.
Because writing is what?
Omg a season like Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains where they start on opposite teams and have to vote one of their own out for the first few episodes, then they merge and compete individually! I’d watch it a million times
Gia Gunn team villan...Just Gia, she is the team...Walking around the work room in chapstick and a ponytail
Daya Betty, phi phi Ohara, Tyra Sanchez, Mistress (I don’t rlly consider them a villain but I know they’d stir the pot), kandy muse, Tamisha Iman  There’s definitely more villain that I’m forgetting lol
Ok congeniality would have to be miss Cucu, Latrice and Valentina because she'd be amazing on a survivor type season
all time villians, then i’m picking s4 Phi Phi Ohara, s5 Roxxxy Andrews, and then s11 Rajah Ohara for my first 3 picks.
this whole sub should be a part of it cause yall love to be gross to the queens specially the black ones
Id put Bob in
Bosco and daya def for villain
Let Parvati guest judge too
Acid Betty!
I dunno if Tamisha counts because she wasn’t presented as a villain whatsoever during her actual run on the show.
Haha but how are you going to force Roxxxy and Ra’Jah to revert to their old personas?
In what universe was Bob a villain?
Also Bob is my fav queen lol…y’all need to take jks
Bosco? a villain? 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Omg yes!
No but I think she has potential based on all her post show drama
i never said i was. i just said all time villains, meaning that i’m picking them as they were in their seasons of being a villain
Monets
They gave her villain esque edit last season
Okay but the post is about creating a season not just naming all time villains.
lol ok
We so got cheated out of this fierceness 😢
I want nothing more than for this bitch to slay them all with her finale look 🤞🏼
I can’t remember anything from her in the workroom . Like, at all. I feel extremely BAD for her:(
I can’t believe she did Karen and not She by Sheree
**l love Estelle**
Poor thing but just not good for television.
Serving womana
Don't worry, there is still the Game within a Game at the reunion which Robin will win after beating Jax to Lipgloss by Charli XCX and Cupcakke.   The Top 4 will then quit because they are too afraid of Robin Fierce coming back. If you watch the Sneak Peek of the Reunion, you can hear Mistress scream in terror as soon as Rupaul talked about Robin.  ![gif](giphy|uSQ5KZyVErSv3UVZYh)
As a tribute to Asia O'Hara, Robin will reveal killer bees under her dress, making everyone run away and giving her the crown by default.  ![gif](giphy|gal8tSSHsw5W0)
You can  always comment something nice on her social media or buy her merch if you want to.  Save-A-Queen.
You can be a freak?

I actually like all of them. I think they all did really well with this - normally there’s one I don’t care for but not the case this season
Toots across the board
Anetra ate my whole family
Did somebody fart? Because it smells like a bunch of toots in here!

Luxxx’s was a cute dress but not creative and unique
Luxx always seems to wear dresses half a size too big for her.
Anetra’ a look was most unique but they all understood the assignment.
You get a toot, you get a toot, you all get toots!
If MIB wore green hair, she'd be a pineapple.
They're all good, so I'd give them all a toot. That being said I'm not like, completely taken away by any of them and kinda wish I got more
Might be rubbing against the grain a bit here but honestly....mehs across the bored. Anetra did the best without a doubt though.
Luxx is wearing the same wig that Robin Fierce wore when she came into the werk room
I felt Lux Noirs look was pretty basic, it wasn't glam enough. This whole season with exception of Sasha has been a fashion let down.
Mistress Isabelle Brooks
1. Anetra 2. Sasha 3. Mistress 4. Luxx
I’m sorry but mistress looks like a lampshade
This is not my favorite MIB look, I think she’s worn stronger looks throughout the season. I also don’t particularly like Luxx’s look. She needs some padding up top, because her outfits tend to move without her.
Toot, boot, boot, toot
Toot boot boot boot.
They're all different shades of toot.
Anetra tooted that fucking duck
Toots for everyone except Luxx   I’m a Luxx fan so don’t come for me! It just didn’t looks as polished as her other looks and the lace of the wig was unfortunately the wrong color.
y’all about to be mad at me but sasha looks a hot mess
Luxx Noir London
Toots across the board!
Love the rings on Sasha’s arms
Anteras hair ALONE is a shoot. Everyone looks so good
Toots! Toots! Toots across the board!
They all did great, but I feel like Anetra was the only one with an original lerk.
Anetra left no crumbs on this one
Sasha and Mistress's looks genuinely do it for me the most. Just so beautiful and decadent.  Luxx's is gorgeous and that wig (if you're forgiving with the hairline/blending) looks stunning, but it's a little simple compared to the others.  Anetra's looks expensive and luxurious but there's something about her aesthetic and taste level I never connect with at all. I don't think there's a single Anetra look that I've been gagged over. The hair is just weird to me and it doesn't feel like a cohesive overall look. Maybe it's the colour story? Idk, I feel like there's so much blind praise for Anetra and I don't get it, especially visually!
I love Anetra’s look, but the obvious cutout in the middle above the waist is where the fantasy ends unfortunately.
I toot the first two from Anetra and Luxx because they’re gorgeous looks and fit so well, shoot the HELL out of that beaded number on Mstrss because what the fuck?!?! Every spot, every inch… it’s beaded, and toot heavily** (it’s a close shoot) Sasha’s sparkly look. They’re actually the prettiest collection of final looks!!!! I’m very happy with the top four.
I completely love everyone but mistresses. I would have loved mistresses dress all the way except that the neckline is just throttling her double chin and it makes her head look like a zit that’s about to pop.
Anetra had the best look imo but Mistress had my personal favorite look. The rhinestoned cheetah print going into the beaded cheetah fridge moment is so fucking beautiful
Shoots. All four.
Toots all around with special emphasis on MIB. That gown is incredible.
I am a sucker for that sapphire blue Anetra has on. That's my favorite color. But toots across the board.
Shoot, Toot, Shoot, Shoot.
SHOOT ^toot toot shoot
I'm team Mistresss. She has it all in my opinion.
I’ve never seen anything as goddessly beautiful as what Sasha wore. Even the flowers were stoned.   The beading and fit on Mistress’s gown is really special. It’s gorgeous. She looks great.   I love Anetra but this Ice King look didn’t do it for me. (But I end up never liking skin tight velvet in any color under stage lights. It’s reflects weird on camera. Velvet in person is lovely and it looks great on TV when draped but not tight like this, imo.)
Mistress’ dress is a shoot
Toot everyone except Lux and the weird old lady bun on the back of Anetra’s wig.
Shoot: Anetra and Sasha  Toot: Luxx  Boot: Mistress (sorry, but the look does not appeal to me at all, the prints ended up looking like something...else...entirely and I couldn't get past it. It was definitely clever enough and Mistress is ALWAYS serving FACE but I just couldn't get into this look)
Toot, toot, boot, meh
Boot for all except anetra sorry
All were gorgeous
Anetra's look literally made me do a wow gasp as she came round the corner and that never happens. The others are high end looks but a bit standard and not my personal taste.
They all look good but everyone is so “pageantry”… Anetra is a little more original but I felt like she, Lux and Sasha could’ve done better though…  Not that they don’t look good, of course they do, but I wasn’t like “omg wow amazing this is something we’ve never seen before!”
Boot, Boot, Boot, Toot
Controversial but   Boot: Anetra, MIB  Toot: Sasha, Luxx   And I stan *hard* for Anetra I just didn’t feel this
I love Sasha Colby and Antera (sp)
Hard toot, soft toot, shoot!, toot.
Shoot, boot, toot, shoot
Sasha is just always a cut above the rest. But they're all spectacular.
Toot all of them! There are some things here or there that could be picked on but overall they all did great! Sasha and MIBs are definitely my favorite out of the bunch though!
Toot for everyone. I’m not a huge fan of sculpted wigs like Anetra’s, but I love that it looks like a crown. I kinda wish she had a little hip padding to balance out the big shoulders. I love Luxx’s concept as to why she wore a wedding gown as her final look. I expected a little more from Mistress, but she still ate. I have no words for Sasha, tbh.
Shoot toot toot toot
Toot toot toot toot; sounding like I just ate some nachos
Boot boot boot boot.
They all look amazing
I think I would love Sasha's way more in person than I do on screen. It just doesn't work for me, but sometimes stuff just doesn't translate over video, especially shiny, shimmery, sparkly material like that. I love Anetra's but I wish it was a little less obvious that it's a two-piece. Luxx's is... okay? It's nice but it almost looks like a design challenge that she made that week. Something about it looks a little cheaper than it should. For Mistress, I also think I would like it more in person with all the beads and shine, but I also just don't love where the break is between the top and bottom, not a very flattering line. Regardless, all toots but nothing that truly blows me away.
Toots for all, but anetra & sasha > luxx & mistress
there's something off with luxx's hairline but it still looks good
Sasha Sasha Sasha!!!!
Toots… but I wasn’t gasping at anything really…
Toot everyone! Except Lux
Anetra is like the final boss you got to fight after grinding 56479 hours.
I don’t really like any of them due to personal pet peeves, anetras hair looks like is eating her head, luxx’s lace is like 3 shades lighter than her, I don’t like bread hairs or the cheetah print, and my biggest pet peeve is when the bottoms of a dress just go in a straight line than cut off, but I Literally would’ve screamed if Sasha had like a flare out at the bottom
Anetra & Sasha
Anetra better win!!
Everyone’s look is a toot. I wish Sasha’s dress would’ve hit the ground. The lace on Luxx’s wig was disappointing. Anetra and MIB had my two favorite looks.
I love Anetra, but the non-leotard choices ain’t been hittin for me.
I only wish mistress did a gold or brown eye look instead of her usual purple
Anetra and Sasha are toots for me, luxx and mistress are a boot imo.
Agreed. I was getting bored of the franchise and this cast REALLY brought it this season. Back in my watching-era. Also ANETRA BETTER WALK THAT FUCKING DUCK TO THE CROWN 👑
Agreed  Toots all around, and that’s rare at this stage in the game
Agree, they all look great and think each look says something about the queen wearing it
I was gonna say, toots for all! One of the most talented top 3/4s we've ever had.
Lol I liked your comment because I felt the exact opposite. Love the queens. Felt meh about all their outfits compared to all the great stuff this season
All were fantastic, but I felt Luxx’s was less than the others, which was surprising.
This was my fave. The colour of the dress with the jewels and the beading was just 👌  *well done mamaaa*
Toot.  This, for Anetra, is a GREAT finale dress.
My top toot of the week.
Shoot! Absolutely gorgeous and the fact that she made it herself? Bonus points from me.
Toot, and the design is smart. Still looked impressive after the skirt came off and easier to lip sync in that way.
Shoot, the only really unusual and innovative look for me that day (although the others were all GORGEOUS)
**Shoot**. When Anetra’s on, she’s ON, and this was probably in her top 3 garments of the season. Color is rich and extravagant, hair is gorgeously sculptured, and there’s just enough visual interest with the fringe to keep the eye moving without feeling tacky.
Shoot!! I loved everything about it!
Toot. Hate how the skirt is cutting off the rest of the appliqué details. Also would’ve looked cooler without the rhinestones in the hair, from here it just looks like dirt
would be a very high toot for me but i don’t care for the hair.. it’s too much and takes focus from the gorgeous and detailed gown (i know many will disagree!)
Shoot!
Top toot.
SHOOT because it looks amazing and she made it herself
I LOVED it
SHOOT! Hands down my favorite of the 4. I love the white and blue combo, she's giving villainous realness with a scar to match <3
It was very Vegas. Loved it!
Shoot, best look for sure
Soft toot. Looks like it took a lot of hard work, just not the biggest fan of the detail placements and fringe. Hair is the best part IMO
I can tell she put a lot of work into this but it looks like a cheap Diego Montoya knock off.  I HATE that the skirt tear away cuts the body suit’s design off.
for me, this is a shoot. especially considering she did this herself. i love this queen
Total toot but hated the jeweled tassel tacked on to the middle of her derrière. Guarantee it is stretch velvet; that girl makes every look as a potential dance costume.
Toot, For me the material of the dress is off but overall design of it / style is interesting. Also, the hair is done well and styled in a cool way, but something is off about it’s intended symmetry
SHOOT
I absolutely hate the fringe. Boot
I HATE THE SHOE   The wig is one of those that looks amazing still but weird moving.  Dress I amazing.  Toot.
I like it a lot, it reminds me of a Gundam at the same time it reminds me of old chenille blankets. My parents used to have a blue chenille blanket with white decorations that look just the same.
Shoot! Especially because she made it.
The hair is cool but issa boot
I want to say toot, but it bothers me a ton that the design in her dress cuts off at the mid with the clear tear away portion of the dress covering the bottom of the design. So it’s like a soft boot from me.
My top toot
loved the shape and detailing, wish there was a lil more pizzazz below the waist but I realise "final looks" aren't so final any more and we get the real deal at the actual final
Toot! The gown was gorgeous, but the flowers in her hair really completed the whole look.
The HAIR
This was beautiful and Toot but I felt like it didn't live up to some of her other looks this season to be used for the finale "best" drag.
if only it hit the floor
It’s a toot, but it could be improved: the two lower snake like ornament are throwing her silhouette off, it gives the illusion of her mid-section being wider than it is and make her appear slightly blocky
Toot, but I really didn't like her shape in this dress. She went from a being shaped like a literal number 8 in the last challenge, to the shape of the number 0
It’s… a bit confused for me.  It isn’t a boot, but it isn’t a toot either.
Soft toot. Her face was beautiful but I just don’t like or get the dress.
Is it me or her eyes were extremely pulled back and she couldn't close them?
As someone who loves Sasha and is pulling for her to win.. I don’t like this. I can’t really tell what the idea is and her makeup wasn’t her strongest. Anyway #TeamSasha always
Toot, but the bracelets are unnecessary. Also, not her best look. She could have used this one in the first episode and that black and red one as her final look
Hard boot. Love Sasha, but the base dress looked so basic and the flowers looked very cheap to me. She’s brought some great looks this season and I honestly think this was one of her weakest :/
Mixed feelings. The styling is a little too "oldschool" for my personal taste, looks a little dated, like some look from To Wong Foo. It is a little too campy to fulfill "eleganza". I like everything individually, but not at the same time. She looks beautiful, though.
Absolute toot
**Strong toot**. I really wish the dress from the waist down wasn’t quite so up and down bc the top is SO stunningly, ethereally beautiful, especially with the details in the hair and cuffs. Truly just this side of a shoot.
Toot
TOOT! It's gorgeous and absolutely has her own unique twist to it. Stunning!
Top toot. Absolutely.
Toot but it’s not her best
Toot
White is so hard to translate into screen. She looks so amazing in pinks peaches and coral I really would have loved to see her in something brighter. Glad she had the leg out.
The irony is that they'd probably fit IF SHE EVER WORE BODY LOL
i can't unsee this now thx
I just saw Manila girl.
I would have liked all of these gowns to have a little (or a lottle) bit of a train on them. I think that would have given more balance since they were either top/wig/headpiece-heavy and some extra pizazz.
The dress is beautiful but I wish her hair and makeup matched it? The look feels disconnected to me
Seeing the dress in motion on the stage makes me toot it. It's really not exciting in itself.   But it is made beautifully and Mistress always looks impeccable.
Toot. I wish the neckline wasn't so close up around her neck though but the beading is phenomenal. She hasn't posted it on IG yet -- I'm interested to see who made the gown.
Soft toot, but it looked like chocolate chip cookies
Toot! The beading was stunning, and it was a good old-fashioned drag look. Plus, walking the runway in a 60 pound gown is a flex.
NOOT (neutral). I'm pretty underwhelmed, it's not bad by any means and the mug is fabulous but the dress doesn't blow me away. I'm not a fan of the beaded leopard spots either.
Toot, but I feel like it’s a garment that benefits more from seeing it in motion. It doesn’t have the same pizazz in a still photo.
shoot. the leopard spots being individually beaded on.. stunning.
What I love about MIB is how many looks she brought that weren’t specially made for the competition. She served what she regularly brings to the table at home and served, she did ☀️
MIB is my favorite queen this season, but I don't think this dress looks good on camera. Like Raja said on FPR sometimes the camera just can't capture the beauty of some dresses. IMO it just looks like an average pageant dress. I don't like the styling too.
I just…i hate the pattern of the dress, and the way the hanging beads fall. It’s just a miss for me. Boot.
Boot! It looks so dated.
first time i saw it i hated it but now it’s a toot
Boot--kinda boring--feels like her other looks
It was giving pineapple instead of leapord for me. Still a soft toot for that beading though
Toot. the bitch knows how to wear a dress
**Toot**. The beading was immaculate, the Divine style pageant mug is breathtaking, and the hair serves the look. I would’ve preferred a lower neckline instead of the turtleneck and tit window though
SHOOT
Toot
Boot. Proportions seem off, though I like the idea. Some issue of balance between body and hair.
i'm getting tired of the trend to not wear padding
Yeah, I think I’d agree with this.
It's feels Érte inspired, beautifully cut. But it's not working for her.
It was really not up to par
Still a Toot but I thought this was the weakest. Something is up with the colours around the wig line
BOOT. Weird silhouette, weird fabric, looked half done.
Softest toot of the bunch. I do love how she ended her season’s runway package with a wedding gown, like a traditional fashion show.
Wig line was very distracting and I thought the dress looked wrinkled? Hate to say, but a boot for me
Toot for the dress, boot for the concept.  I don't see how this shows her point of view on drag. She had an AMAZING runway package and this don't relate to that edgy and fashion forward pov that she presented all season long.
Boot
toot but that hairline was distracting
Very basic and her wigline is a mess. Boot.
Definitely the weakest. Normally Luxx is stunning, but this dress was way too big on her, and her wig line was so obvious you could see it from far away. Boot.
Boot
Soft boot. This one needed padding
Toot! I love the nod to haute couture shows by showing a wedding gown as the closing look.
This is an effing wedding gown, I don't get why she didn't fully commit herself to the wedding fantasy?! If she were a veil and tiara it could've been one of the best looks of the night. I don't get why she wore the look this way. The dress is gorgeous, but the styling... I think almost every queen had styling issues this episode.
Soft toot! Definitely not my fav final runway look ever, but I appreciate the concept and idea behind it and it is generally a nice looking gown.
Toooot! I don't see why people are off on this, I really like it
This was actually my favorite so I'm surprised that it's in last place :x I thought she looked the most beautiful and the dress was the most elegant imo.
Toot and I understand that every couture fashion show ends with bridal it’s just the least exciting of the four to me personally because we’ve seen bridal done to death on the show but I think she looks so damn beautiful and that mug is always a damn toot.
**Strong toot**. This is stunning, y’all just don’t like Luxx and it shows. She’s showing off her haute couture knowledge by doing bridal to close her runway package, though I wish she’d have worked in some lace detailing to sell that specific point of reference just a bit harder. Still, gorgeous silhouette and walked beautifully.
SOFT TOOT. I like it but I don't love it, the lace on the wig is too light for her complexion and it's distracting. The dress is white and kind of boring, I wish she went with some bright colors :/ Still pretty though.
Love the dress but her legs look orange to me
Very prom
Boot. The hairline seemed odd and she’s worn more excellent looks imho.
I don't know why but it looks like someone photoshopped the dress on her
I'm a big fan of Anetra in general but agree with everything you said here, especially about these four looks. Sasha's and MIB's were on another level.
Yes, that's my problem with it as well. (That, and the velvet. I'm just not a fan of velvet.) It would be so beautiful, but then that cut. :(
Is this what no drag knowledge mouth is?  (Just kidding! I respect your ^wrong opinion)
This comment is a boot
She looked pretty but, and this might be a weird critique, she looked really short in that gown. I know this wasn't a particularly tall cast, but Luxx usually gave a "tall" illusion.
The hair is a shoot but the dress is a boot.
Luxx really wasn’t giving ~DRAG~ for me, yknow? She looked great but I wish it was a bit more extra
Looked too modern bridal for me and on the white stage just felt sort of bland. The mug is great and she looks good.  I think if she had a bit of a color pop in it would have been more successful. Something to show the layers off more. Like a deep red or green. Maybe even more applications to give it more texture.
Somehow that runway made me think of Shea Coulee, I might be crazy...
I think it's that it's just plain white fabric
I don't get it, personally
Also, the shot of her shimmying out of the skirt coming off? Respectfully, a shoot. Ahem.
My favorite part!!! So in love with this nod to Hawaii.
It happens every season where "best drag" looks end up being mediocre because they have to switch outfits around last minute so by the time they get to the end of the season, they're just wearing whatever they have left.  If this really isn't her best drag then it's because she had to wear it in a previous episode for a different challenge or this was just a backup because production wouldn't let her wear what she wanted.  I still agree with you that it's a beautiful look though.
That’s what I thought, the bottom half of the dress is so blahhhh
Yeah I didn't love it. The flowers in her hair don't match the space theme of the dress and jewelry, and I just personally don't care for the bracelets.
THANK YOU!
Just what I was going to say.   The hair did not go with the dress at all.
When that dress started moving, that’s when I audibly gasped. Those glistening lines of beads sashaying down the runway, it’s beautiful.
I agree. If I’d only seen the photo, I wouldn’t be wowed. However, when she was walking the runway, it was literally dazzling.
Okay actually that gives it bonus points for me. 🍪
I feel like it needed more colour. Beige is hard to make a wow factor for me personally.
It was giving Fred Flintstone imo
I think it still looks good, but her yellow gown was really a stunner to me!
How does it feel to go through life so wrong
Agree shoot.
I agree. My SO was waiting for the judges to mention it but since it’s the last look they didn’t give many critiques
Why does no one see this! And the fake scalp has to go it’s like 15 shades too light
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage the ten tapping toes of...  GUNKY HAIRLINE!
Or at least tailoring
I don’t care what you think lol you don’t need “drag knowledge” to like or dislike a look
I was getting prom
she’s previously used space and futurism in her previous runways and style so she was going for that here, futuristic queen. I think she did it pretty well.
Toot for the camera operator.
I think a lot of times they try to do something more demure for the final look, the runway categories don’t usually call for simple glamour
Pretty fabulous tbh 💅
It just feels very much like sis is stomping around her childhood bedroom with a bedsheet wrapped around her and her older sister’s makeup on. It doesn’t meet the level of the other girls. Not even close.
Sheeesh, I literally just mentioned it in my comment. Glad I'm not the only one lol
At least trim off the loose threads
I got modern bridal. Almost like what you would see a designer on Project runway make for a modern bridal gown challenge.
I'd definitely buy that. The look is impeccably executed so if she just wanted something a little more tame it's still a strong toot.
Haha so much this
you’re doing too much girl….
💀
No they usually crown each of the top 2 sometimes more depending on format and occasionally a double crowning. The actual winner doesn’t know they won until the episode airs
Yeah they started filming all finalists' crownings after season 3, where Perez Hilton spoiled Rajas win. So basically each queen has to act their win out... which must be weird to do and to watch, but kind of nice for them to have that moment I guess! If you look on YouTube, there's I think from S5 onward the live recordings of the queens watching the final and finding out they actually won, so you can watch their "real" reactions!  Also,   >I feel silly even asking stuff since I am so very new to watching  NEVER feel silly asking questions about something you want to know more about! The only way you find out is by asking (and if anyone makes a snarky comment about it - ignore them; at one point they didn't know either, and more than likely the only reason they know now is because they read it somewhere or someone told them!)
That must be really weird for the final queens to film each one winning! The crowd and the other queens all have to act surprised each time!
Ahhhh okay!! I was all like if the live audience from last week had found out who was going to be crowned and had to sit with that for 2 whole weeks- I mean I would literally DIE.  I haven’t been able to think about anything except this finale for at least 2 weeks now just as an MTV viewer and I am about to just pass away already from the absolute anticipation LOL!!
Ru actually joked to the crowd this last time that she tells the girls to consider it the final acting challenge lol
Yeah they have to do it this way because spoilers get leaked immediately during the finale filming. This is the only way to keep who won a secret until the finale airs
> The crowd and the other queens all have to act surprised each time!  Remember that it's TV. If they have a close-up of you clapping because LaGanja did a pre-show warm-up number where she did a great jumpsplit, there's no reason they can't re-use that shot to celebrate someone else winning the crown 7 hours later.  The people in the room do still have to get into it and cheer, but it doesn't have to be *perfect*.
One season had a double crowning (no spoilers since you are new), and they filmed the crownings separately and edited it (kind of poorly, haha) so that they tied.
In some of the finales, you can sense the audience is more authentically excited when their favorite makes the top 2 than when the favorite actually is crowned, since they were fake clapping for the multiple crownings.  ("Okay, now we will crown contest B, everyone clap like she really won. Annnnnd action!")
That’s crazy!! But I still think it’s pretty cool that they try and keep it a surprise even for the girls…. Now if I can make it to next Friday is the next problem 🤪🫣🥴
That must still be wild to be in the audience and like get to see that process like in real time…. I bet that’s super entertaining too since the girls have people they can perform for and they can feed off that additional energy!
I love camp and quirky queens like Crystal Methyd, Utica, Pythia, Ginger Minj. Also have a sweet spot for Brooke Lynn and Kameron, so queens that can lipsync and serve body.
**This is my pretty extensive list**: Joslyn Fox, Jaida, Jinkx, Jackie Cox, Jujubeee, Jan, Jax, Angeria, Chi Chi, Alexis Mateo, Heidi, Denali, Farrah Moan, Monét, Yvie, Scarlet Envy, Willow Pill.  *not in order but I did frontload the Js*  So Js have a pretty good chance, I love southern queens, otherwise  ![gif](giphy|gHaSPezw13ohST1tvR)
I'm overweight and have a lot of self loathing from it. I find that loathing extends to "big girl" queens. That realization makes me feel even more ashamed. It's not fair to take out my body issues on others.
I lean into the art-fashion queens myself. Give me Raja. Give me Evie. Give me Naomi. Give me Sasha V.— plus all the others I am spacing! :)   &#x200B;  But I gotta say, I end up loving all these queens every season. :) Some more than others? Maybe, but I ain't tellin' which. Our girls are brave and amazing. Every single one.
Women and transfemmes who are talented singers and dancers (e.g., Jinkx, Sasha Colby, Peppermint), and queens of all genders with very self-effacing humor (e.g., Alyssa Edwards, Monet X Change, Victoria Scone)
Rupaul may not love them but I love me a weaponized BFA:  Rose, Jan, Marcia x3, Alexis Michelle  Unrelated but also Courtney Act, jujubee, Tia Kofi, Raja, Manila, Jaida  So I guess talented all-rounders
Raja, Anetra, Sasha, Tayce, Jaida, Rosé… nope, guess I just like hot people?
I tend to always root for the pageant queen. Big gown Big hair
My list: Katya, Trixie, Jinkx, The Vivianne, Bianca, Ginger Minj, Bob, Miss Vanjie, Gottmik.  Apparently we love a queen who will make us LAUGH & put on a show
My favorite queens are those that give good HAT.    I’m just fascinated by fascinators!  Ongina’s Barbie hat was what inspired my business over a decade ago!
Here’s my list: Katya, Sasha Velour, Raja, Bianca, Violet  What’s the pattern here?
I love paegent queens so much. Also for cities I love NYC/ATL/CHI queens
same type here, i fucking love the oddballs! i think my absolute favorite are the ones who are oddballs but also unapologetically honest/bitchy, like yvie oddly or daya betty
Pageant and comedy queens for me! Oddly enough since they used to be pitted against one another. 😅
Tend to go for the oddballs/CUNT queens: Yvie, Willow Pill, TTT, Detox, Alaska
Queens with dramatic silhouettes and discernible talents 🤩 Brooke Lynn Hytes, Jaida Essence Hall, Loosey LaDuca, Sasha Colby, and so forth.
I, too, am an oddball lover. With strong underdog appreciation   😊
Mine are Yvie, Anetra, Katya, Sasha Velour, Raja, Brooke Lynn Hytes, Bob, Crystal Methyd, Icesis, and Willow. If there's a through line (other than being beautiful, fierce and talented humans) I don't see it. 😂
Hmmmm do you really consider Gottmik as an oddball though? I mean obviously you do since you said it… but what exactly about him gives oddball?
I’m generally TEAM 🇵🇷 when it comes to queens.  Also I generally fall for the “quirky/goofball” queen.  That and queens who generally make their own garments and not rely on buying expensive outfits
Would a squirrelfriend mind telling me what my ‘type’ might be?   Alaska, Jinkx, Pearl, Thorgy, Shea, Symone, Willow, Anetra?  Edit: misspelled (butchered) squirrelfriend
Willow Pill, Lemon, Jax, and Icesis Couture are my top 4
Oddballs and fashion queens, so, Naomi Smalls, Aquaria, Willow Pill, Luxx Noir London, Jinkx, Tammy Brown, Crystal Methid, Charity Kase...
I can't believe how attacked I feel by this post rn. I watched DR Belgique alone for the first time, and a week ago I started watching it with my bf. I asked him to guess my favorite(s) (Drag Couenne and Athena Sorgelikis) just based on confessionals, entrance looks and first runway. He guessed them right away without me giving him any hints, and when I asked how he knew, he said "you literally have a type with the weird/kooky queens and the fashion queens". I thought he was just fucking around but after going over some of my US favorites, it totally makes sense (Sasha Velour, Willow Pill, Utica, Aquaria, Jinkx). It's very true but I never made the connection until my bf pointed it out.
Pangina, Shangela, Nina Flowers, Katya, Jaida, Tatianna, Jinkx, Angeria, Alyssa Edwards, Heidi N Closet, Vangie, Bob the Drag Queen, Mistress, Denali… Not sure if all of them have anything in common but I do love a pageant queen.
I was just thinking about this the other day!  I love a lot of queens and enjoy their different qualities, but the ones that have a special place in my heart are the more reserved, introspective sporty girls. Denali, Kameron Michaels, Katya (to some degre; she really has transcended every and any box that you can put her into, but her first lip sync to Olivia Newton-John always reminds me that she is THAT GIRL when it comes to flexibility), and, ofcourse, our Queen and Saviour Anetra.  I trully love fashion queens, quirky queens, theater queens etc., but the quitere ones that have a sports/dance background just melt my heart. Maybe because their presence is a validating experience for my younger self? Who knows, I'm not a scientist.
I definitely gravitate towards the artsy / punk types & the silent-but-deadly types, as you can infer from my flair lol
Jaida, Angeria, and Joslyn are prob my faves but Joslyn is my hometown queen so she gets an automatic boost but also she's so cute and funny
A hug to you. Stigma is hard to bear, and it’s not your fault that you have internalized all of those fat hating images and messages that surround us every day. I hope you will be less hard on yourself for your feelings.
Saaaaaame 🔥
All finalists with an iconic runway moment (or wearing the same dress every time 🤡)
i think its the makeup and runway package more, she had some of the more alt looks on her season and also that white face paint
Thank you.
Pearl being fan favorite season 7 is wild to me. We really did just want the hot guy to win lol
Jaida Essence Hall being the only recent winner to break the fan favorite pattern feels CORRECT!  ![gif](giphy|VdF2OTmONgYoOnfnph|downsized)
People often say Bob was the clear winner in S8 but as a viewer watching it live I actually remember thinking Kim Chi would win and remember seeing Kim had the most fan support on socials too.   It’s just funny how post S8 Bob has cemented themselves in the fandom as an absolute untouchable legend - but seeing this honestly reminded me it was not the case during the season.  Very similar to Anetra/Sasha. I think in a few years time we’ll all realise how Sasha really steamrolled the competition in S15 but our current bias is towards how much we love Anetra!
Rewatching season 8 and I friggin love Kim Chi so much 😭 sometimes I (somehow) forget that
This whole thing has been wild tho because a lot of what I see is like Anetra is the fan fave but many people still think Sasha SHOULD win even if they want Anetra to win so idk if we’ve really seen this particular situation before…
Pearl was really the fan favorite on season 7 for both IG and twitter, huh…
Also, me as a Ms. Mattel stan is very pleased that she was the first queen to break into the double digits in support on Twitter and the first to cross 100k in support on Insta
so either anetra will be the second queen since s8 to be the fan fave on social media and not win the season or sasha colby isn’t gonna win s15 and neither of those feel right
LOL I see the social media intern thinking they’re so smart with Sasha and the rose emoji (or prescient???).   Yvie doesn’t have the most likes by far, but she does have the most retweets which is kinda odd.
What's wild to me is Trinity getting number 1 support in AS4! Never I imagined! Can you? I forgot those days 😅
Ok look, I love Sasha Velour and I wanted her to win at the time but ain’t no way she was the fan favorite to win.
Pearl is the only one who came across as a likable person at the time
You don’t understand the impact of “Do I have something on my face?” It was the GAGGIEST drag race moment at the time and had the entire fandom & alumni shocked. Personally speaking, it was prob the cuntiest move I’d seen on Drag Race and to this day I still regard Pearl as one of my fave drag queens
I mean 50% of anetras fans always bring up her hotness as boy as to why they like n support her… 🥴
At the time I was like “Ginger I guess?”
People just really hated Violet and Ginger so a lot of people defaulted to Pearl as their favorite
The other two are bitchy
Kim Chi found dead. 💀
WERK (not) FAN FAVORITE!!
> It’s just funny how post S8 Bob has cemented themselves in the fandom as an absolute untouchable legend - but seeing this honestly reminded me it was not the case during the season.  I tend to think this is because the *only* area where Bob was notably weak during S8 was runways. And since her season, she's fixed that: she has *become* untouchable.
That’s so funny cause the live reaction when they said Bob’s name Kim says “I knew it” lol. Even Kim knew that Bob killed S8
I believe there is a dissonance between fan favorite in social media and in the public by large. Online there is more investment from young fans, who tend to support younger queens. I think that's what happened season 8 (and 10, 12 and this one too IMHO), where on social media the new queens had more votes, but the offline public opinion was mostly Bob.
honestly i rewatched s7 recently, and she really was very likeable in the second half of the season. Violet and ginger not being particularly for alot of it also helped pearl be fan fav im sure
> Also, me as a Ms. Mattel stan is very pleased that she was the first queen to break into the double digits in support on Twitter  10 fans, what a time to be alive.
Was symone a fan fav tho? I could’ve sworn Gigi and crystal had way more votes if I’m not mistaken…
The most retweets of any queen ever!! Cray.
She's Yvie Oddly and oddly enough
of all the finalists she had the best track record so it made sense. plus, the whole shedevil issue was non-existent back then.
I don’t think it’s surprising she is the most winning queen of all time and has never had a bad track record. She gathered on that season. She’s not an untalented queen, she’s just…got her demons (shedemonsbynight)
Sasha won on twitter, Shea won on instagram
Agreed. If Katya or Kennedy had made the finale, they probably would’ve been the fan favorite over Pearl. That said, I don’t understand all the Pearl hate. I really loved and still love her drag.
Seriously. People love to undermine queens based on their perceived attractiveness, which if you ask me, is kind of a shitty thing to do. Pearl was a fierce competitor, who got an underdog edit. She went up against two shady queens that rubbed some fans the wrong way. Is anyone surprised she was the fan favorite? Katya is probably the only one that could have beat her in a fan vote.
she did say recent….
Definitely! I think it was also bias coming from the fashion serve of S7 - it felt like maybe we were in the fashion era  and Kim would be next cause Bob’s runways were so crunchy at the time but I can’t wait to see Bob serve the runway redemption in all winners
Yeah but 80% of them were bots 😤
they are not even from the same season, gurl...?
both symone’s instagram post and twitter post got the most likes out of the season 13 finalists. yes she was a fan fave
Everything was a check!  It's just surprising to see her photo together with Anetra, Willow, Symone, Crystal etc. in the post about the fan faves for the crown!  Totally forgot that she's the majority's choice before! I remembered I am Team Naomi towards finale and root for Monét on the day of the crowning! 😅
Of course she's talented! What I'm just pointing out is you can never thought of her as one of the **fan favorites** together with Anetra, Willow, Symone, Crystal etc. You can't convince anyone she belonged there. 😅
Fair enough.
Katya yes, but fans *haaaaaaated* Kennedy at the time.  All Stars 3 is when she turned around for the fans.
A lot of gays just hate other gays who aren't loud and outgoing and are quiet
I still don’t get how violet won on a season of pure acting. Ginger made the most sense.
It is. Happy Friday 🥰
Kim chi found old 👵🏻
Sweetheart. Girly girl. READ. I was simply asking because Jaida wasn’t a fan fav, symone wasn’t a fan fav, so I was asking, someone else. NOT you, just specifics on the ratio to how many fan favs/non favs have won. It’s a question, and you gave no answer, carry on. Muah Xx
Thank you for simply answering my question, that’s all I needed to know, I felt surrounded by Gigi fans so I was just wondering that tea xx
Really? I loved her, so maybe I missed that. She had me at Little Richard.
You phrased the questions confusingly. Also the cattiness you’re giving isn’t cute like you think it is
I downvoted myself, I wanted to be cool like everyone else 🥹🥰 toodles
i don’t understand the connection you’re making between gigi and symone and i think the other person who replied to you was confused about the same thing. gigi was on s12, where she had more fan support than the winner jaida. symone was on s13, where she had the most fan support and won
At the time, the perception was that Ginger and Kennedy were the bitter old Betty squad who just hated on younger talented queens because of their own insecurities, and that Kennedy was the worst of them.  It was definitely racially charged on top of that, plus Kennedy sending Katya home… it was real ugly re:Kennedy for a long time.
You’re right, it’s not cute, cuz I’m  Gorgeous lol. Want my instagram handle or what? Direct message me for proof 🥰 I asked just fine, and you don’t need to approve that. Xx
I simply. Was. Asking. The ratio of fan favs vs non fan favs. That’s literally all. And you answered it just fine :) thank you! Have a great day.
Thank you. You finally made me convert to homo…phobia!  ![gif](giphy|CkMyq0LUu1r6CAI62w)
Nah I’d rather not because someone who is delusional isn’t attractive in anyway. Don’t try me again bc the queens in my town (one DR/BB alum, in particular) have shown me how to bite back
Wow! A gif lol
Life disagrees with you. Real life, like not on Reddit. 🥰 Whether you’d rather or not, I can prove it, anyday. Delusional because you said I wasn’t cute and I said I was cuz I am? With facts to prove if need be?  Nawww Delusional is someone who thinks their chewing when they actual aren’t, nibbling maybeeee? Maybe you didn’t learn enough 🥺  Alright, time for the pool, kisses :)
Life disagrees with me? Life disagreed with your mother who decided to actually have you and not abort your ass. But kisses hun  ![gif](giphy|3ohze3kG5qO9DcTUbe)
She didn’t abort me because she knew uglys like YOU were here and the world needed balance to offset your unfortunate presence. I do the heavy lifting, community service really, you’re welcome. Now go look in the mirror, cry, and tell your mom I said hey diva 🥰 HUGS n KISSES UGLY
Performing to Paramore??? Fucking iconic
Every. Last. Thing.
In the words of Latrice Royale and Alyssa Edwards: sex siren
Sasha is the embodiment of perfection. Also, I’m a sucker for hairography, and Mother keeps me fed.
Goddess
This performance??  Well done ma ma
Never seen so many people recording a drag show like it is a concert, that’s the power of Sasha
No competition for mother.
She is just so flawless ! And you can see how much fun she is having while killing it too - the end when she’s just all happy 🥰
![gif](giphy|3oEduPvO4LqfCl4SZO)
The upcoming cast of All Winners 2 is quaking.
Sasha always goes for fucking bangers and not typically drag songs and I am obsessed with that, like doing the Cranberries Zombie for talent show. She’s honestly the best and it would be such a shame for her not to win.  But I still want Anetra to win lol help x
If people ever ask you to be grateful and you wonder why, remember her.
I said at the beginning of the season that if u get a chance to see her live....run....U want sex kitten? U want a ballad? She is a show!!! The reason she is your favorite drag queens drag queen
Im gonna marry her. She just doesn’t know it yet. 🤤
Sasha Colby's Music taste>>>>>>>
The true garden sprinkler of drag
Sasha breathed while she slept?  She wore shoes on *both* feet?  Wait, she peepees and poopoos like us??;!?!?!!  I C O N I C   Q W E E N  W E R K  G O D D E S S   ;P
Are we allowed to say this? Won’t Luxx’s fans / Luxx herself come for us?
The only thing i want for my birthday, is a piece of that cake.
We are living in the best timeline. Sasha Colby and Paramore! I love it
She’s so hot. Women aren’t my thang but good Moses Sasha is insane.
Her hairography needs to be studied by scientists, philosophers, and gurus. It’s mystical.
Tightest two the show has had in a while
what are u even talking about, y'all say anything
You're a nobody.  Why would Luxx come for you?
Same. Not into women at all but Sasha does something to me that I can’t fully explain..
Luxx haters taking any opportunity to complain about Luxx.
This response is more on the generic side.
So she didn’t come for Trinity, just because she wanted other queens to win?
There's a very obvious difference between 'Sasha Colby is everything' and 'Sasha Colby, Mistress & Anetra are everything I hope one of them wins'. (And none for you ~~Glen Coco~~ Luxx.)
I think I’d rather see them do “España vs the World” and it’s only spanish speaking queens (including PR queens). Let them be funny in their native language!
Of the top of my head a kind of bring nothing and make it work type of season. Maybe have a mini thrift store and actually working sewing machines for that one lol  Also might be random but I want a top chef drag race crossover and even if it's just for an episode
All Stars: All Delusions, my fantasy season of delusional/delusional edit queens, would be too powerful
I would love to see a season of queens of Asian heritage. What a great way to showcase talent from drag race Thailand and Philippines, but all across the world. On the US seasons we get Asian queens who are either early out or get to the finale or close, with only one Asian winner in Raja (that I’m aware of).    Rice queens unite!
Lovely fifth alternate season
Reinas Puertorriqueñas!
BATTLE OF THE DRAG FAMILIES: Davenports vs Colby’s vs. OHaras vs Edwards vs Mateo, and so on
Survivor had Game Changers, I think Drag Race should have Door Openers
A drag race villains cast will at least be diverse lol.
And Madame LaQueer!!  ![gif](giphy|RpKLvuBoGBX5C)
I was just thinking about a “Girl, you were robbed” season. Like, Shangela, Ginger, Manila, Jujubee, etc.
A runner-up season would be fun, and they’d all probably kill it since they were already so good their seasons. Who would get the coveted title of runner-up’s runner-up?
Give me a season of the kooky queens - Tammie, Crystal, Monet, Utica, Ginny, Yuhua, etc.  Or a Christmas themed season, with all Christmas runways and a Christmas Rumix and Christmas acting challenges.  Or Drag Race: Classique and it’s just the queens from the earliest seasons.    The cliche answer is also a season where they make all of their looks on site.  Ooh and last one - a celebrity season where regular queens are paired up with someone like All Stars 1, so every challenge is both a makeover challenge with whatever the standard challenge is on top.
I'd watch a season of drag teams! Imagine Jinkx and DeLa VS Bob and Monet VS Alaska and Willam VS Sugar and Spice VS Sasha and Kerri VS Trixie and Katya VS Yvie and Willow VS Violet and Gottmik VS Bianca and Adore VS Crystal and Daya, etc. Throw in Vanessa Van Cartier and Envy Peru for international flair.
I wouldn’t mind a lip sync assassin All Stars season with lots of performance-based challenges. Many of our legendary Queens are incredible performers, so let them have a platform to show off their skills.
Lol I was telling someone there’s a Puerto Rican or two most seasons of RPDR. There’s definitely enough to make a PR All Stars 😂  ![gif](giphy|fU4XavxJ2RrlOfEF6B|downsized)
Miss congeniality race
Drag Race family editions. Former queens that are mother/daughter or part of the same drag family compete! Make it a team like All Stars 1 or just have them each compete individually. Either way it would be fun to see!
Drag Race All Stars: Lipsync Roadkills
Runners up/finalists.    Arguably just as stacked as a winners season. Raven, Manila, Shangela, Detox, Adore, Kennedy, Peppermint, Asia, Brooklyn Bimini, Gigi Goode, Daya all brilliant choices
All Judges with Merle Ginsberg picking Michelle Visage's lipstick  ![gif](giphy|xUOwGekYfLysKT1a92)
Outside of the main Drag Race format, I would live for a season based on talent-shows or themed performances. But I would find it very feasible for queens with low budget or who can't just invest for Drag Race.  Pretty much the TV edition of Nightgowns. The queens can be given the theme, get an episode of preparation, and an opening night with an audience. Alumni wanting to prove themselves, and non-alumni expecting some exposure.  I guess tha, since the competition format makes everything ten times more addicting and watchable (there's stupid competition shows about everything), it would mean to make this show competitive. That could be based on the brief that the queens got a week before their show. Or a bottom two competing for their live the WEEK after they get nominated.  On a side note, instead of a "season", this could work wonders with a rotative cast with ins and outs, and a regular programming for off-season. Very small contracts and productions that involve little to no attachment would attract queens from EVERYWHERE. Seeing a few drag performances, and see who's new at the roster and who's not. That way, the queens aren't really forced to invest on a whole wardrobe, but just invest on what they can afford for a few episodes and leave. Invite a house of queens who want a boost on their town, invite a few newbies, invite a former Ms Continental, make stuff outdoors filmed in local bars... a mix of everything, everywhere, all in drag.  Honestly if Sasha or Bob are reading this, they better know that the Reddit girlies are real producers 🫣💅🏼 Give a job already.
Season of all with six letters and three vowels 💙
All Stars: Dynasty!! Would love to see cohorts of drag moms/daughters/siblings compete against each other. I imagine it kind of survivor style: the season starts and they compete as teams, with the winner being a whole family and the lip syncs chosen from the losing family
def would love families, or a congenialities vs villans thing
I would love to see spin-off seasons focusing on the different aspects that we already have on drag race. Like a season that’s all sewing challenges. Every single look gets made in the work room, kind of like project runway (I think, i’ve never actually seen PR). Or another season that’s all acting challenging, one that’s all live singing and performance based. And then have there be no filler queens. Imagine a sewing season where every single queen was like Raja, TTT, and other great seamstresses. The looks would be stunning
I know AS1 was a bust for most people. But DR Teams with a bigger prize would be an idea. Idk about the elimination though, maybe more like AS7. It could be friends or family members. The teams would pick each other so they would likely have members who are strong in one area teamed up with a queen with another strength.
And Alyssa Hunter!
Best friends
I'd love a drag family season. O'Haras, Davenports, Michaelses, etc.  I want a Best Judy season where queens compete in teams, but they'll know about it going in.
All Stars Miss Congeniality season. All Stars Over 50 season (imagine the SHADE). Another legendary legends season.
Celebrity drag race but inviting veteran drag queens like Coco Peru, Lady Bunny, etc.
I agree, I just think it’s kinda insane how many iconic queens came from Peurto Rico as a relatively small country.  I heard a rumour that, in the early days, they would nominate one queen from Peurto Rico who would audition for Dragrace. The show found out and stopped casting Peurto Rican queens for a while because of it. Apparently, Madame La Queer auditioned out of turn and was ostracised for it.   Random tangent but I thought it was funny even if not confirmed lmao.
my top two queens for a season like this april carrion and adriana, esp adriana bc she’s so funny in english which is her THIRD language. she’d also be great for france vs the world
I would love this! There's incredible queens you can pull from Espana (obvs), UK, US, Canada, Italia, Holland and more.  The thought of having a season with Juriji, Hugaceo, Alexis, Choriza, Enorma, and more is just too good.
I love the bring nothing idea! It would let the Queens show off their creativity and skill, and it would be a nice respite from the financial drain that Drag Race has become.
Big Bertha would be in paradise for that second one
The crossover I didn’t know I needed
The way they would let loose
There would be a lot of emotion for safe
The Yuhua erasure... she could add another crown to her pile.
Second is soon to be Anetra I hope…🫢
Jessica Wild, Willam, Alyssa Edwards, Trixie Mattel, Thorgy Thor, Monet Exchange, Tatianna, Ben de la Crème  Yeah…that might win.
Raven or Jujubee would get the runner’s up runner up title lol
No shade to Kerri but I think mother Sasha would have a better chance with someone else. Maybe Kylie since they are great friends and were roommates or maybe Sasha Velour would be a good one as they’ve worked together and are friends as well. I love Kerri and her drag I just don’t really think she’s good at drag race. I enjoy the rest of your pairings though
Sugar and Spice found dead about 5 minutes in lmao
And Priyanka and Lemon!
Imagine something like: (regardless who wins) Jaxx, Anetra, Sasha, Yvie, Kennedy… on the same season doing this
that would be kinda boring absolutely no shade ![img](emote|t5_2t3or|4805)
That would be kind of cool. Bring out 3 families with 4 members each. The individual members can be voted off, but whoever takes it as the winner ends up winning a prize for themselves and for the house team members. That way they all have motivation to individually succeed, but also want to work to support and save their family members. This way there would also be different ways to strategize. Like do you plan to have someone that has a strength in a specific area (sewing/design for example), but is weak in others to give you a possible advantage in specific challenges or do you pick a team that's all dancers, etc.? This way you'd get to see some interesting interactions between the families and amongst the members themselves.
You could toss in Katya, Ginger, Mo Heart, Naomi, and Kim (if she would do it) for extra fun too.
honestly i don't rly think that would make for a great season.. while we have amazing congenialities, most of the us ones have already been on AS so i don't rly get the point of making one tbh
Or Sasha Colby!! Either way, unless there is an unexpected upset we are getting our second
Isn't Joslyn the season 6 fifth alternate?
I absolutely see it for Jujubee 😂😭
Agreed. But I think they're better as a team than they are individually.
Exactly! And maybe we could get the triumphant returns of Brooke Lynn Hytes and Laganja to the competition. I’d also love to see legends like Coco Montrese and Trinity K. Bonet. It would be so sickening!
I love this so much
sasha colby is native hawaiian. i understand the confusion, however, despite pacific islanders often being grouped with asian americans (aka AAPI), native hawaiians such as sasha are not asian
Joslyn went home on the makeover challenge leaving Ben, Darrien, Adore, Bianca, and Courtney from what I recall, so yes. That would be the fifth alternate.  Edit to clarify: first alternate is second place, second alternate is third place etc. fifth alternate would be sixth place which was I believe joslyn.
Poor Juju lol 😭
It really would be!
I'm so glad the show has moved on from 'drag is a cis man in a dress'. That's never been the whole story of drag, and it's weird looking back that they stuck with that idea for so long. And now so many winners and fan favourites are trans and nb or in the broader spectrum of gender and that's just so much more representative of drag out in the real world.
This is why i get annoyed when people say Sasha shouldn't win b/c she already made it/has all the accolades. Drag Race is a Huge Platform, probably the biggest platform for a Drag performer to be on. Especially for their career, even Queens that are legends like Jackie Beat probably doesn't make as much as famous queens on Drag Race. It's not the end all be all of drag but it's the biggest fame/career booster you can have as a drag artist.
Sasha really deserves all the long overdue spotlights and flowers. I remember in her older interviews it really sucks when she mentioned how frustrated it was she couldn't ask for the same price at any gigs like other drag race alumni.
[SOURCE](https://www.them.us/story/sasha-colby-ru-pauls-drag-race-season-15-interview)
Even without including how much she's slayed the season, a sasha win is so necessary and correct considering where we were 10 years ago with this show and the 'trains flag'
Damn, she moved to LA specifically to make it on the show and was on a standstill for years, that’s really terrible, I wonder how many other trans queens it’s happened to. I don’t think people on this forum understand just how big of a platform this show is for drag and for a seasoned queen it would be important to reach this pinnacle as the next ladder in their careers. Look at Brooklyn who grew into her host skills but had her own franchise less than a year after appearing. Look at ru gurls on commercials, plays, movies…  It took far too long for the show to change its mind but it was cause of the viewers’ pressure. Funny enough, it didn’t change soon enough because of the public’s pressure and there’s still a ton of viewers who express anti-trans sentiments.
Even if the promos for S15 were the first time anyone had ever seen Sasha, she slayed the season. It sucks for rest of the Top 4 who are all worthy winners, and the fandom can get a little touchy when the winner is SO predictable from the jump, but they might as well turn that runway into a shrine to Sasha at this point. She killed it.
Whole thing is wild to me (and transphobic as fuck) because doesn’t Ru love referencing Paris is Burning every other sentence? Did he miss the whole entire movie where all the queens are trans?
I knew she wasn’t on before because of the way they treated trans queens, but for some reason thought it was because she didn’t want to deal with that and it wasn’t until Kylie and Kerri had good experiences that she decided it was worth it. So disappointing that they said no. She needs to win.
I especially want Sasha THEE Colby to win because of this full circle moment. She wasn't cleared for Logo but has bitchslapped the MTV era for the better. #TeamSasha
So she could have been on Season 7? It's really sad how long it took WoW/Ru to change.
I used to be of the mind that drag was for men and that if you were transitioning then it was unfair because it was no longer about the illusion; because after all, you’re a woman now.  But I was just ignorant. So ppl acting like it should be given to someone else because she’s already a winner isn’t it. She should win because she’s been serving from day one. IMO.  To find some excuse to give it to someone else minimizes the show, the title, everything. You only enlighten ppl like me by telling the full story and letting ppl win because they deserve it.
It's so wild considering that Kylie and Monica came out literally on the show, in early seasons
Oh hey 😳  But yes, this is why the fanbase diminishing Sasha’s success on the show to hype Anetra leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I love all of the finalists and they deserve the world. But people saying that Anetra is more “hungry” for it or that she did well but didn’t really “break out”… y’all, Sasha is hungriest bitch in that room. She killed the season and she made it look easy so no one would question that she deserved to be there. It was not. And no matter who wins the season, give Sasha her damn flowers for stepping into a space that had historically excluded her and smashing the competition.  (Also, please stop diminishing the other queens by saying they were chosen to guarantee Sasha’s win. The cast has the usual mix of well-seasoned queens and newer, less experienced girls. And plenty of cunty, legendary queens haven’t done well in the Drag Race format.)
Winner ❤️❤️❤️
It’s too early for met to be crying at work 😭
Translation: "we love you but Ru is transphobic AF"
So now someone needs to run the stats of if she were to complete in any season (as an extra queen not a replacement of anyone); what would be the outcome lol
I just cannot fathom anyone else winning. No shade to the other girls it just doesn't make sense.. and I think this is a time we *really* need to be uplifting trans people in society. This platform is so important!
This really breaks my heart. I’m so glad people are finally getting to see the beautiful person and extraordinary performer she is. This is her crown and her time is now
people really forget how transphobic drag race has been for almost its entire history
This is so infuriating. Glad she and other trans queens are finally getting the opportunities they deserve, but it took way too long!
I think she had a lot of room to negotiate before agreeing to be on this season. They have her up against a lot of young queens to help solidify a win for her. Not that she needs it. But I’d hardly call most of the cast her peers. She’s been doing Drag longer than all of them and most of all of their lives. She’s seasoned and ready to be handed the crown.
While I feel for her and how that must have been to go through. I also feel like everything happens for a reason and while it took such a long time for her to get here I’d rather this than a logo season …
Imagine all the years we've missed of Sasha because of this? It's sad that she was just a hidden treasure but also happy that the world gets to see her now 💖
You mean in another world, Sasha would’ve won Season 7?  This is so sad. I’m so glad the show has evolves for the better
I'll never forgive production we could have had sasha colby so much earlier
If Sasha were on a Logo season, she’d be read for being “too polished” or some shit, be eliminated midway through, come back for All Stars, and be the second or third out.
She's going to win. She was set to when since the season started. They did this with Kylie love 🙄
Moved to LA to pursue getting on drag race, but never auditioned? And waited to audition until after so many trans performers were not only on the show but came out on the show? I mean she’s great but I don’t understand why this particular statement is so endearing….. her struggle is similar to like 20 other people who actually auditioned, got on and crushed in US and international I don’t understand
She’s already so rich. And famous.  Give the underdogs a shot.
You can also blame the contestants too. Lole that time Shangela speculated a contestant’s gender in S3 and everyone hating Alaska’s boy look in S5.
I mean gay marriage itself was still illegal when the show first started. From what I remember in interviews with Ru there was just a lot of worry about the average *viewer grasping it. I know it doesn’t seem like that long ago but 10 years has helped increase his ability of trans people.   Now I still disagree with the choice and feel trans people should have been on Logo seasons. However I am glad Sasha has the bigger platform of MTV. Logo for being a queer representation was terrible about pushing content which is probably why is is in whatever state it is. All I remember is golden girls reruns, drag race and 1 girl and 5 gays. Maybe there was more I missed and they didn’t promote well enough but so many reruns. She’s been a favorite of mine for a long time and deserves the most, which isn’t logo
Exactly especially considering that Older drag queens that paved the way for us were drag queens who were actual trans women who couldn’t transition medically give us our flowers because Ns but Trans Women are the very foundation that is drag.
It's sad as Ru is an older gay....And old school southern drag was full on trans queens at the club...I'm 50 and came of age in Nashville in the early 90's and the clubs always had trans performaners...The biggest best gay club in Atlanta had Charlie Browns Caberet which was full of trans girls...One of them used to strip at a tittie bar
>'drag is a cis man in a dress'.  I don't think it was ever that necessarily, given Kylie and Carmen etc have said the show was supportive of them. Rupaul just had some weird hangup about surgery(his comment regarding Peppermint is what really started the conversation and change iirc).
I agree with everything you said, but the 'cis man' part is not unique to the show either. The Miss Gay America pageant, one of the oldest for drag, doesn't allow contestants who take female hormones or have feminizing surgery below the neck. That's the one Alyssa Edward's won, then lost her crown to Coco Montrese.
This!! People like Peaches Christ, Heklina (RIP), never get the recognition they deserve. And, sometimes, the legends don’t make nearly the money the DR girls get all because they weren’t on a major reality tv show. Not saying the DR girls don’t deserve it, but it sucks for those legends who have been around for years and don’t get the credit/money they deserve.
Just because we haven’t seen her journey of her transition on screen doesn’t mean she hasn’t struggled with it and is still struggling. Every day she goes out as herself is a protest
>>probably the biggest platform  no shit
Ikr, I remembered reading this and imagined how must it must’ve hurt. Get all the flowers and coins that you deserve, mother Colby.
Thank you  ,
💯💯💯💯
I can't imagine a world where Sasha doesn't win this season, like her winning just feels so correct, I'd love to see the other girls in the top 4 get crowns at some point but this season just feels like Sasha's
It happened to many! I know people love to clown on Bitter Betty/Sara Andrews, but this was her crusade as well - trying to get trans performers cast, for years. I adore Sasha and have since she owned Continental 2012, and there should have always been a fully accepting place for trans performers. I'm glad that we got to that point now, but it should've never been a barrier to competing in the first place.
Ru is such an interesting ambassador for drag. He has said in the past that his interest in it was primarily commercial, and so it’s always seemed that he failed to understand or out-and-out disrespected queens whose relationship with drag was more deeply rooted in their exploration of gender identity. He sees is as a part to play, a switch to flip. It’s pretty atypical and far from the default perspective, so it’s notable and problematic that he’s had the honor of defining what drag is for the greater public.
lets not start pulling the blame gun at people, cuz bitch. we all know how this sub and community was 5 years ago when this discussion came up.  its been an evolution and a healthy discussion about the "issue" and im glad we are here now.
and the community is  to blame  for that, wow/ru will only do things if the community allow it at the end. they will not fight against the wave.   5 years ago, this sub was in shambles about this specifict discussion.
Sometimes waiting just a bit longer can result in outstanding results. Sasha’s moment is not only deserved but NEEDED during the current US anti-trans political climate.
No. [As late as 2018](https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/03/rupaul-drag-race-big-f-you-to-male-dominated-culture) Ru stated he probably wouldn’t accept a queen who had begun to physically transition. IIRC it’s the backlash over these comments that really pushed the needle.
2014 is when season 7 aired, I think,  but when season 8 was casting. So she probably would have had naomi's spot in the finale, but honestly I don't think she would have won given the challenges in S8.
we need her to win! periodt.
Kylie came out in the reunion and Monica came out moments before she sashayed away ("coincidentally", by some magical luck of the draw 😉😉😉, to "Only Girl In The World"). Pep was the first one who actively competed while out, and then Ru diminished it by basically saying she was still mannish out of drag.  It's been a rocky road.
This post is not about Anetra buh you found a way to bring her into it and put her down to elevate Sasha. It seems like a running trend here and more so in the spoilers sub. Y’all can root for Sasha without shitting on Anetra. Anetra fans can also do the same. We all can’t root for Sasha, that’s humanly impossible.
I remember Ru said it wasn’t fair for trans people to compete because they have an unfair advantage, and I was like what the fuck…
Ru isn’t the sole owner of drag race
Sasha could’ve won season 2, season 7, and seasons 10-14 (IMO)
We don’t need to handout out wins to make a point. Your statement makes it feel Sasha should be given the trophy for being trans. I disagree very much and thinks she should win because she earned it.
This is what makes Anetra so damn fierce! I believe the win is deserved by Sasha, and I am sure that is how it will go. but DAMN! Anetra is hot on her heels. You really have to hand it to ALL of the other three finalists for hanging in there and showcasing their talent so well, all the while knowing the deck is stacked in Sasha’s favor. Well done ladies! What lovely first, second and third alternates!,
I’m downvoting because you act like they haven’t been avoiding anyone older in these new seasons. Most of the girls that get casted are young, period.
I think they'd give her Chad Michaels' storyline
Did you read the part about her knowing people in production and the business? “We love you but it’s not going to happen because you are trans”
Wow this just screams unconscious privilege. If you’re a part of any minority with any of your identities, is it that hard to empathize with a similar experience where you’re excluded? Often times ____prejudice isn’t this explicit but they literally told her don’t even bother.
thats true, and by the same token we can thank contestants over the years - everyone from trans women like sonique, to genderfluid or nb queens like courtney act and bobtdq, to those who were just plain allies when it wasn't convenient for them to be so - like alaska herself.  it took a looooot for us to get here, and i won't forget or take for granted those who helped the show and our outside world to be that little bit safer and more welcoming to the trans community.
I remember Milk walking down the runway in S6 on “night of a thousand Rus” and she had dressed as boy Ru wearing a suit. She got absolutely flaaamed for daring to wear pants down the runway, and for having done some looks previously with a few boyish or more masculine traits (like a little goatee). Imagine that happening now. It’s interesting to see how much more acceptable gender fluidity has become on RPDR, which is what drag and drag culture always has been in the real world.   And snatch game, too. I had to google it but Kennedy Davenport on S7 was the first queen to play a male/masculine character (Little Richard).   It’s good to see it’s all much more acceptable than it used to be on the show. It’s also interesting that it took the show a while to “catch up” with being much more accepting and even advocating for trans or non-cis queens, especially since Ru was so directly involved with ballroom drag where ALL sorts hung out since its proliferation decades ago. Thanks for reading this ramble
I remember the fandom also hotly debating the topic about 5 years ago as well (God I'm old). I cringe cause I was definitely on the wrong side of the debate but I've definitely changed my mind and I know the vast majority of the fandom is on the correct side as well now.  It's weird to think how flagrantly transphobic so much of the community was even just 5 years ago.
I even remember them criticizing someone for not wearing a breast plate, iirc? Was it Violet? I don't really remember too well, so I might be misconstruing the situation.  But look at the show now: an entire rusical episode where all but two people are in some form of boy drag. Insane.  I await the day they allow a drag king into the franchise. Landon Cider is such a polished king and, honestly, the RPDR community is missing out on some sick looks.
No. Remember when judges always comment that drag is always about men dressing up as women, and that you cant do boy drag? They did that until season 6.
Carmen and Kylie didnt publicly identify as trans until after their season. Ru publicly talked about how important the transformation is for the TV show and clearly didn't want any femme women in the workroom, trans or cis, for a long time
Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't Kylie and Carmen come out as trans only after the show though?  I think the closest we've had is probably Monica Beverly Hillz (?) coming out during the show, but I don't think production cast her while they were aware of this fact.   Peppermint is the first queen I remember that came onto the show as trans, but again I may be wrong here!
It was that, though. That's what RuPual believed in at the time. She used to say that drag was about the transformation from man to woman specifically. Lance Bass once got in trouble for saying transphobic slurs, and RuPaul chimed in saying he should say it even more.   RuPaul has come a long way in a short time. You have to give her credit, absolutely, but that doesn't mean we should forget that there used to be a time where trans women would wait until they were on the show to come out because they knew they would not be cast otherwise.
This is false. Carmen was not out publicly until after her drag race run and did not begin transitioning until after her season. Kylie also was not out as trans on S2. Ru literally made comments stating that it needed to be men doing drag or it wasn’t punk rock. That was the reason they let peppermint compete in S9 was because she had not medically transitioned yet. He made pretty shit comments about how women didn’t belong in drag just after S9 which was a shock to everyone considering Peppermint had just been runner up and he said basically well but she didn’t have implants yet 🥴 he came under fire massively and that is when he suddenly became supportive of trans competitors. It’s also why people like Carmen basically hate Ru and the show because he was (maybe still is who knows) massively transphobic.
Kylie said they literally made her stop hormone treatment in order to appear on Season 2, respectfully what the hell are you talking about
I mean it wasn’t even that long ago that “you got she-mail” was in the show.
U know what, this also makes me think we should be more careful with throwing around “so and so doesn’t need the crown” bc u never know how much this means to someone. Without this interview I would have thought Sasha just went on the show for sport truly bc she’s so iconic without it.
I hope Ru & WOW amp up their inclusion of drag pioneers, especially after losing two already this year.  I did like that Love Connie was on this season, but much more could be done.
My point exactly, i can't believe they never did a Legend season or had any of them on a judge or advisor. (now it's too late for Heklina rip). A Legend season w/ Coco Peru, Jackie Beat, Heklina, Lipsynka, Peaches Christ, Varla Jean Merman, (i would also put Raja, Chad Michaels, Shannel and Bianca in here instead of their own season) would be incredible!
Yeah, I think it was important to her to show that embracing your transness is joyful and empowering at a time when so many people want to make her existence a crime. I’m glad WOW let her tell that story. But she’s been through it, and there are hints of that on the show too.
i think this is also why drag race has had such a weird impact on drag everywhere because it doesn’t portray what real local drag is/has been for decades. so then you go to a local show and its just completely different than what some people expect, and then the local queens get shit on for that
Unmmm lol. I literally just said that if you quote Paris is Burning, it makes no sense to say only cis people get to be drag queens. Trans people have been saying this for many many many years. Nothing new. And the fact that the “at large” queer community has always been on the transphobic side doesn’t mean we shouldn’t call it out.
and i can't even blame wow or ru, this community and even this sub wasn't the same 5 years ago.  alot of people's mind changed these last 5 years.  im glad everything changed for the better, this is how progress is made
2015 is when Season 7 aired actually
FWIW, Monica won Only Girl in The World. She went home a week or 2 later to Coco in When I Grow Up.  I remember cuz the Pretty in Pink runway was one of my favorites and Coco's outfit reveal turned the fawkin party.
Jiggly had started her social transition, but had not started her medical transition due to lack of funds and because of the “don’t transition” rules. Her mirror message was about how she could now afford some gender confirmation surgeries.
Wasn’t Peppermint forced by contract to stop taking hormones in order to compete?
I didn’t shit on Anetra? I said I disliked the way some of her fans diminished Sasha by saying she wasn’t “hungry” enough or Sasha didn’t “need” the win like Anetra does. If anything, my whole second paragraph was calling out people dismissing the cast as being chosen to guarantee Sasha a win. Anetra is a drag superstar. *All* of the finalists would be worthy winners. I just think Sasha did better and she made it look easy.
Miss Gay America uses this reasoning to ban trans contestants to this day.
But she is the executive producer and if she says no to something it's unlikely they'll go against it.  Because without Ru they basically have no show.
I genuinely think Sasha *could* have won any season. I mean some of her best work comes from the earlier era of when the show was airing…  Imagine seeing 2012 Miss Continental Sasha competing against Rolaskatox and Jinkx
A’keria vs Brooke vs Sasha would’ve been an amazing idea for s11 actually woww
I really don’t think Anetra’s hot on Sasha’s heels. Anetra’s great, but I think she duck walks too much and needs more variation in her moves, and I never thought she deserved to win the Rusical. I also don’t think she won the lip sync against Mistress in the last episode, and she was the worst by far in the standup challenge.   I honestly think the TV show has pumped Anetra up to make her look more like competition to Sasha than was warranted. This was in order to keep the season from looking like a foregone conclusion and thus boring to the audience.  I think Anetra will be great on an All stars season when she has a time to round out her skills more. She has amazing potential, but I don’t think she’s there yet.
Meh. I’ve seen Luxx flail around enough and I’ve seen Mistress flex her pecs. I’m upset there wasn’t more fierce competition for Sasha. But I also feel like she has enough negotiating power to say “I’m not coming on just to leave early like the other drag legends on previous seasons. If Sasha Colby is going to be on your show. Sasha is going to win.” I think they cast around her to make her win easier. Sasha didn’t need it.  ETA : Thanks for the sewer slide messages. Rotted!
We’re on the same side but go off, queen.
I disagree she can have fun and is not afraid to take risks which I think is missing from a lot of the queens with the “professional” edit. She’s a professional but she doesn’t take herself too seriously
Yeah I read that part, but like I said, plenty of other trans people auditioned and have crushed it on the show. This isn’t a dig at her, I just don’t get the logic here. If “someone tells her no” held her back for like 10 years why wait to apply now if they’ve had trans contestants on since like season 10
Exactly. And I’m not trying to shade them but I am glad that we saw a positive shift from whatever we were years ago.
Ru was never much of a ball queen, her scene was more club kid drug raves  before she rebranded as a Glamazon.
I appreciate this comment so much. It’s hard to admit you were on the wrong side of an argument.   I had a very recent change of opinion on trans women playing sports, and I feel guilty about my past beliefs because it hurts a community that’s already so persecuted. Glad we can grow and learn.
They did that THROUGH season 6 and probably through season 7 if you count how they treated the Half&Half runway.
When did they get rid of "Gentlemen, start your engines and may the best woman win." anyway?
I always thought of it as originally trying to appeal to studios, advertisers, media etc etc and a man transforming into a queen was a more marketable proposal. Then the show became bigger than that…  And I think it’s shame it had to start out like that, but if that’s why it did then I’m glad we’ve evolved to where we are
I tripped over this series late in the Logo run so I may be imagining things, but around that time wasn't a Queen ~~straight up disqualified and kicked off because she was trans? Or almost kicked off?~~(or...maybe it was between end of season and the finale she came out and there were "issues" and people thought she'd mislead everyone?) I sort of recall a conversation about that in one of the finales during a  marathon leading up to the 'current' seasons finale.
I’ll never forget Ru’s “performance enhancing drugs” comment. The transphobia ran deep.
Thank you. Does everyone have amnesia or are they forgiving the blatant transphobia or do they actually not know cause 😬
I can't find the Kylie interview right now, but Monica seemed to think it wasn't an issue. It's a bit confusing, because I do remember Jiggly saying she felt like she had to present as a boy to be cast.   **Being a transgender woman isn’t against the rules on Drag Race, as far as you know?**      Monica: Logo doesn’t judge. They support everyone. As long as you’ve got charisma, uniqueness, nerve, and talent.   https://ew.com/article/2013/02/05/rupauls-drag-race-monica-beverly-hillz/
Yeah Kylie came out during the reunion, don't know when Carmen came out and I don't think production cast Monica knowing she was trans, Peppermint was the first openly trans girl cast but I think there were still restrictions in place towards trans contestants until fairly recently
I don’t know that we need to give her credit at all. Did she come along way or was she forced to give in because of public backlash for leaving out incredibly important people in drag? The backlash Ru and the show received after her transphobic comments was MASSIVE. I’m not sure at that point she had a choice but to put up or shut up. Perhaps her opinion has changed. I don’t know because I don’t know her personally. BUT the network may have also stepped in and said yeah this ain’t gonna work anymore and you gotta pipe down. 🤷🏻‍♀️
Ah thank you.  I never fully understood why Carmen hated him soo much especially now that there were trans women on the show.   But I never came across anything that ru had said, especially after peppermint.    Are you able to provide me links to these things?
Sorry, this is not to defend RuPaul but just to make you feel old - it was eight years ago lmao. https://www.thepinknews.com/2015/03/02/rupauls-drag-race-axes-youve-got-she-mail-catchphrase/
Personally I’d love to see Coco Peru the show at some time.
Huh, I was so sure it was 2014. Weird!
Haha I'm dumb, Ty
Not sure about Pep, but Jiggly was
She could’ve won any season except season 1 since RuPaul was only willing to crown a more traditional drag queen that season
I love Anetra but agree with your points. I would rather Anetra go onto an All Stars season.
Agreed. I worship the ground Anetra walks on but how many times has she been in the bottom.
I also don’t think Anetra deserved her makeover win.  It was a bodysuit with some fabric on the arms.  Anetra’s great, but her showing on the show hasn’t even been close to Sasha’s.  People love Anetra in part because of her many lip syncs, which honestly is not a great sign for her chances of winning.  It means she was in the bottom a lot and that she’s already shown a lot of her tricks before a lip sync finale
>I’m upset there wasn’t more fierce competition for Sasha.   The only way that could have happened is if they stuck her in AS7. Maybe next All-Winners.
It sounded like you were saying they bargained with her to have young queens so it’s less competition but they’ve been doing that for awhile.  Idk if they ever negotiated before for someone not on all stars, maybe Bianca?
Maybe because while permitted, the implicit prejudice and bias was pervasive?  In 2018, after Peppermint (1st trans) made it to the finals, Ru was interviewed and the vox article paraphrased "RuPaul picked his next words “carefully,” his answer wound its way to saying that he “probably” wouldn’t have admitted a transgender woman like Peppermint — an iconic New York City performer who made the finals in season nine after coming out as trans on the show — if she had already started gender-affirming surgery."  So yes, while she could've auditioned earlier, would she have been valued or judged fairly?   Similarly, a lot of gay guys are athletes and play sports.  There have been a few open athletes in major sports.  So why aren't there more?  The logic to find here isn't that difficult.
My guess would be she was feeling it out to make sure the show would actually respect the trans contestants and not just use them as a pawn to correct their wrongdoings. She probably also had a lot of negative feelings about the show because of their transphobic views
It is definitely much better, but it still feels weird that Drag Kings (and Things?) aren’t really allowed. I don’t really share the same aesthetic as most of the kings I’ve seen but you can’t deny their talent.
Yeah, Michelle is actually the one with the ballroom background
Just out of curiosity how do you feel about trans athletes?   I’ve never had a concrete opinion and I’ve always struggled to find a position I feel right about.
I still can’t that Kennedy had a nerve to bring Little Richard to snatch Game. Icon.
And that time Michelle complained about Violet giving boy
Youre right!!
When like… they created the challenge????
I’m pretty sure “May the best drag queen win” replaced “May the best woman win” when GotMik competed, but I’m pretty sure “gentlemen” was gone before then. Maybe it was removed season 9, since I think Peppermint was the first girl to be openly trans at the time of casting?
Which is wild cuz they were on the explicitly gay cable channel for its first 8ish years??
It could have been the reasoning. But it just doesnt make sense especially for a show that promotes drag is political
I agree they were def trying to market to the common straight with a narrow mind
Do you mean Gotmiks season? I don’t think so, I may be wrong though!
For me it was a comment about how no woman with breast implants could compete, I think this was circa Peppermint's run. Like hiding fake tits is what wins you Drag Race?  Also, LOTS of cis male queens got fake ass implants and then don't pad and it was always seen as a positive (oh she's giving body!). Just very dumb, thinly veiled transphobia.
Jiggly was living her truth before she came on the show and had to go back to dressing as a boy all the time on the show. She even wrote on her mirror message something along the lines of "now I can finally get tits". I also remember Willam saying that Kenya was already taking hormones, but perhaps that was allowed at that stage because it wasn't a surgical change?
Y'all scream at folks that they need to change and then when they do, you continue to punish them ad infinitum. What exactly do you want Ru to do here?
https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/03/rupaul-drag-race-big-f-you-to-male-dominated-culture This is the original article that sent everyone in a frenzy.  The comments relating to drag are a little bit in so skim if you don’t wanna read it all. I was trying to upload the screenshots but couldn’t figure out how to do it. No one said I had to be pretty and smart! That would just be unfair 🤣
Here is another article that shows some of the queens: namely Detox and Carmen fighting back against Ru’s statements   https://www.them.us/story/rupaul-drag-race-season-12-trans-queens-detox-carmen-carrera
8 years?! Holy shit I feel old lmao
She'd be a fabulous comedy coach and guest judge!
i loved her gta playthru
It was a long time ago, don't stress!
Which is crazy cause to ME, Sasha is the drag queen’s drag queen
Well I think upset is def me choosing the wrong word. It would have been interesting to see her with a more stacked cast of seasoned queens!  And I agree with you!
More like her saying “THIS is what I can bring. You’re not gonna make me an early out or I won’t be on the show.” Again not that they’re gonna let her win but basically agree ahead of time that they won’t pull any shit like eliminating a legend for the gag of it.   I feel like if anyone has this clout it’s her. I don’t think granting that request is much of a step further than what production already does.
It’s a bit convoluted but at the end of the day, I think it’s the lesser evil to let trans women participate.   I do believe that going through male puberty can give athletes an advantage. It is also true that A LOT of top performing athletes have genetic advantages (ex. Michael Phelps), but we don’t disqualify those people.   Sports is a great way to build discipline, make friendships, be part of a community, and stay active. I don’t believe we should take those opportunities away from trans women who already receive so much backlash and often feel isolated.   Also, there’s not that many trans women in professional sports. Of course, the few that are playing get shoved down our throats by the media and make it seem like a bigger “threat” to cis women in sports than they are. It’s essentially a non-issue used to further demonize trans people.  IF women’s sports start to lean towards trans women and cis women get shut out, then regulations might make sense in the future. At this time, I don’t think it’s necessary.  I’m a cis woman who has played sports all her life, to give some context to my opinion.
the way i see it is:   lots of people have natural advantages ie longer legs, naturally higher testosterone (everyone has it) stuff like that  i think in the case of trans women athletes being trans should be considered one of those natural advantages   and sport could do more to open up more gender accepting categories for nb people too
Popping in with a bit of food for thought...  What would you think if I told you that there are absolutely athletes, from young children up to the highest, most elite levels that absolutely 100% are competing while using performance-enhancing hormone treatments?  That these hormonal treatments are well-tested and proven to increase muscle mass, metabolic function, and athletic capability?  A LOT of child athletes are on these hormone treatments and that it affects their skeletal growth, bone mass, and onset of puberty?  And that this hormone that hundreds of thousands of athletes in the US use has been prohibited by the World Anti-Doping Agency for about 30 years as a performance-enhancing substance?    In case you hadn't guessed, I am referring to insulin.  At school-age levels (6-18), if a child can compete while using insulin or spirolactone (commonly used for acne treatments) or any other number of hormone-modifying treatments that are officially considered as doping or masking agents but have legitimate therapeutic use exemptions, there's no reason to prevent trans kids who are not receiving adult doses of E or T.  For kids who haven't reached puberty, it's a total non-issue, and for kids who are on puberty blockers, there are legit health concerns for coaches/trainers to monitor, but like kids with type 1 diabetes, they shouldn't be blanket bans from participation.  For kids who are old enough (16-18) to be on E or T, they can be handled on a case-by-case basis, just like a kid with T1D who may not have the best blood sugar control or a kid using exogenous growth hormone (like Lionel Messi did).   When discussing scholarship money, the NCAA is a multi-billion dollar organization that employs some of the best sports scientists on the planet.  It's ludicrous to think that the NCAA or national sporting bodies are somehow so inept and helpless that states need to ban trans kids from playing team sports in school because some Division 1 recruiter might not know what's going on, or might not have been following high school or club results for YEARS to offer scholarships to a chosen few.  Why is the job of K-12 schools to carry water for the NCAA or, say, U.S. Soccer or U.S. Swimming, instead of letting kids play?  The NCAA has already released its own policy, and it allows transgender athletes to compete provided they meet certain conditions.  That policy follows the International Olympic Committee's policies.  There's already at least one transgender medalist--Quinn from Canada in 2021.
Was that the first male non drag character done for Snatch Game?
And there were boy drag moments ever since
Ew Michelle
To be fair, Violet won that challenge. Whether she won in spite of or because of the androgyny is up for debate.
It was the Christmas special, because Kylie was the first out trans woman on the show, so they wanted to remove “gentlemen”. :)
I believe UK2 was the first to be filmed with the new Racers/Drag Queen tagline as it featured two non-binary contestants (Ginny Lemon and Bimini) but S13 aired it first by a couple of weeks due to the pandemic delays that hit UK2’s filming and airing schedule.
Yeah, so that tagline seems to be a bit of an indicator of when the babysteps happened.
It makes sense why they got rid of gentlemen, but not why they got rid of best women?  Because aren’t they all women when they’re queens? Regardless of their gender when they are not queens?
Ru says on the Alaska episode of the podcast that their primary goal in the first few seasons was re-introducing drag to mainstream audiences (hence why high-brow, intellectual Alaska was saved for S5).  I think it's easy to view this as non-sensical or narrow-minded in 2023, but I'd like to think Ru had enough experience with the public at that point to know the best way to market and ease the world into Drag Race (and thereby drag, which Ru explains as having gone "underground").
no, this was yeeeears ago, while they were still on Logo Network.   (though I did edit my comment to clarify that's the time frame I was talking about)
this was totally absurd. so many queens don't even pad/wear titties these days and it doesn't hinder them from doing well on the show, so why would a queen with implants have any advantage at all? like what was ru even thinking at that point??
I believe Jiggly was also on hormones but wasn’t supposed to bring them to the show so she said it was diabetes medication.
They just said that maybe we don't need to give her credit. Not giving someone credit doesn't mean punishing them ad infinitum. That's just you putting words in their mouth.
Did you not read what I said or are you being deliberately obtuse? I said perhaps she has changed. Perhaps she hasn’t. Do you know Ru? I’m gonna assume you don’t. And no one on this thread likely does so we have no idea if she has actually evolved or if she was just forced to get with it. Her “apology” came out pretty quickly after the bullshit as did her casting trans contestants. Do we really think and believe that she just woke up and her strong held beliefs about an art she’s practiced for decades changed that quickly? I suppose it’s possible. But I think what is more likely is they went OH SHIT we should do some damage control here and back pedal. And seeing trans contestants since then maybe has changed her views slightly but regardless, she has a massive platform and still chose to spew transmisogynistic bullshit about contestants she called her “children” so she is not owed forgiveness nor slack here. Also she is the richest drag queen on the planet much of that wealth from a show about other people’s talent. She is NOT the one who is being punished so that’s a goofy ass take.
Like Ru… doesn’t a trans woman living her truth in a society that hates everything about it also seem like a big F you to male dominated culture??
The comments were absolutely transphobic, though I do wanna add a little additional context that I think influenced where Ru was coming from too. There was a *huge* push for a while, primarily in the 90s and 2000s, by trans women to say “we are not drag queens, and I am not a man in a dress.” It was kinda like the trans equivalent of how gay men had their whole femphobia wave in the 2000s, trying to buy acceptance by distancing themselves from the more *reprehensible* parts of queer night life and community. Excluding trans women from drag spaces was probably something Ru thought of as allyship, just… it was heavily misguided.
Exactly. It’s really interesting to see what the show looks for in a winner. In an early season, Sasha wouldn’t have been cast and Willow would’ve been negatively critiqued for being too out of the box
You’d think but they turned her down a bunch. She may not have applied prior to this season. but she did talk to production and people that work there. I don’t know what kind of conversation happened. It just seems more like a she needs them more than they need her given how many applicants they tend to have. If she wasn’t on, this just would’ve been Anetra/Lux/MIB’s season. Like they wouldn’t have “lost much” not having her on or to deal with negotiating that kinda way. But this is me guessing too.
Couldn’t we just do things in weight class like boxing, or something like that? Take gender out entirely…?
Yeahh this is the ONE area I’m a little iffy about. I think it’s good to approach it with some nuance. if it’s a local kickball league or middle school sport? Then yes trans women should be included, no questions asked. But competitive wrestling? Or a high profile bike race? Uhhhh maybe not. Its not a natural advantage like what michael Phelps has. It’d be like me as a 28 year old going into little league and rejoicing at beating a bunch of 8 year olds and comparing that to a natural advantage.
>I do believe that going through male puberty can give athletes an advantage.  Fundamentally this is not true for most sports after just 6 to 8 weeks of HRT. If you're talking about something like the average difference in height it's not a big difference and a sport where it matters like basketball would select for taller women regardless.
The question of sport being more gender accepting is a pretty lively conversation topic in women's football/soccer and women's basketball in particular. A lot of elite AFAB woso/wbb competitors who are openly gay and a few who are openly trans or enbi.  At least one of them, Quinn, a midfielder for the Canada women's soccer team, is a trans man (and they are the first gold-medal winning trans athlete!).    If you read a lot of media on those sports, you might pick up on subtle phrasings like "sports featuring women" instead of "women's sports," as a nod to their trans and enbi teammates.
Yes, she absolutely changed the game.
They’re not all necessarily queens, some of the contestants are simply drag performers. Still waiting for Kings to get casted tho
Are you talking about Monica Beverly Hills? She wept onstage about being trans,but Ru openly and vocally supported her at that moment. It seemed it was more her own baggage than the show. Later Ru made remarks about drag being for men, but I don't think he behaved that way toward people personally.
My apologies I was feeding my little one and skimmed it!
The conversation about this between Tabitha and Vanessa was one of the few good things about DRH2.
I believe this was about Peppermint so we're already talking 2 seasons after Violet won. It was just ridiculous.
That's a lot of emotion for safe
I'm going to give her credit for showcasing trans talent, regardless of the reasons behind it or how long it took her.
I mean you would think. Or any woman for that matter. Because misogyny and the patriarchy is really who the f you is really to because that shit harms men too.
This would be the ideal solution if it worked.   The problem is that it is a proven fact that cis men will outcompete cis women in most sports (extreme distance running/swimming being the outliers).  “Men’s” sports is actually open most of the time, but most women can’t qualify. It’s the whole reason women’s sports exist.
So what tipped me over the fence on this issue was a study of active-duty military members who transitioned. MtF servicemembers were about even with their cis female counterparts after two years on hormones… but FtM servicemembers were actually *ahead* of their cis male peers after just one year. Yet nobody talks about transmasc athletes being a threat. Why? Because no one thinks that an AFAB athlete could possibly compete with “real” men.  >	It’d be like me as a 28 year old going into little league and rejoicing at beating a bunch of 8 year olds and comparing that to a natural advantage.  This is a gross exaggeration, and it speaks to my point. The average cis male—or even a moderately fit cis male—cannot beat an elite female athlete at her sport. You’d have to be an elite athlete yourself to be in her league. And that’s a very, very small fraction of the population. Now multiply that by the percentage of people who are trans (let’s say 2%). That is a *vanishingly* tiny number of people for the amount of ink this issue has received.  So no, I don’t see this as an issue outside the most elite levels of sports, and even there, no out trans athlete has qualified for the Olympics yet. So right now it’s a hypothetical that’s mostly been used to police women (particularly women of color) with naturally elevated testosterone levels. Doesn’t seem worth getting our panties in a knot over.
This is such a carefully selected issue to blow up. It’s been selected because even people who are highly supportive of trans rights have hesitations. — overall it’s a non issue.  When legislation is put into place for school sports, there are SO few people it affects.   Personally, I think it is contrary to title 9. And I don’t think that’s an unpopular unreasonable position.
Kennedy should have been top 3 over Pearl. Change my mind.
I don’t think they’ll have kings for a very long time, it’s just simply not what Ru envisions for her drag race, she’s made that very clear, she’s gotten much better with her view of drag, dropped the comments about surgery, enhancements, boy body etc. I feel as though she’s changed her views because of the progressive nature of the fandom, media and viewers, giving criticism. Which is great, whatever the reason I think. But I truly don’t think kings will be featured for a while, they may have their own show or own singular season but I can’t imagine Ru having them every season, hopefully I’m wrong but we’ll see!
Oh ok I see.   I didn’t realize they weren’t all considered “drag queens”.     What makes the differences between a drag performer or a drag queen?
> I don't think he behaved that way toward people personally.  I strongly get the impression that Ru's public opinions over the years have always been about what will be best for the show. The more Drag Race has become an established brand, the more he's allowed his own true feelings to shine through. This is, after all, the man who fought hard for Tammie Brown to be on Season 1.
I honestly don't remember. It's very possible, in which case Im glad that I got it wrong.    [Accurate representation of me attempting to remember anything past last week or so](https://media.tenor.com/Fq2rjEmIB0gAAAAM/tom-and-jerry-searching.gif)
nothing to apologize for!  reread it and realized, yeah, could go either way.
I wouldn't say so, they're right tbh
You asked, they answered.
“We’re saying f you to male dominated culture!” *upholds male dominated cultural norms*
Your examples are only for trans athletes that have been on hormones for 2 years. On an elite level hormone levels is how it’s decided. So for athletes that have not been on hormones for 2 years, does your opinion change? And if we do base it on hormone levels, then there are Intersex people who identify as women and  can have children that are disqualified.
Definitely agree with you there! It’s beyond idiotic that lawmakers are focusing on this when they have a MILLION more important things.
I think the main difference is that allies have reservations mostly from an organizational standpoint, like how do we divide these athletes so they can compete on a level playing field with a large pool of competition?   On the other hand I feel like the bigots will take the issue and run with it from this weird moralistic perspective, like somehow trans people are trying to exploit the system and get wins.  I think all humans should have the opportunity for athletic competition, but I don't really know the best way to organize that competition because I'm not trans or an athelete lol
i just rewatched and i agree 100% i’m not sure why she wasn’t, pretty much all other decisions (aside from luxx beating anetra in the lalaparuza but that’s a conversation for a different day) but kennedy not making top 3 doesn’t make sense to me at all
It is rumoured that Drag Race France opened the castings for S2 to all kinds of drag performers but was stopped by WoW because they want a season hosted by Ru to be the first one featuring a Drag King. Years ago a lot of people would have said we’d have never seen an openly trans person or a cis woman compete, so one can only hope
All drag queens are drag performers. Not all drag performers are drag queens. It's ultimately just preference in terminology.
I love it that you are giving him the benefit of the doubt. Lots of folks in this sub love to trash Ru. He is a flawed human being, like ALL OF US, but also none of this would exist without him and his advocacy.   I love seeing the transwomen on the show.  And he made it possible. Not fast enough, maybe, but he fought hard for this show and here it still is.
Yeah, that never happened on the show. Though, allegedly Kylie was forced to go off hormones before filming, but I think that’s the closest thing?
🤣🤣🤣 for real!!! Like how you gonna say women don’t belong in drag because it’s an f u to male dominated culture when you exclude women. So weird to me. I’m just glad we get to at least get some beautiful women now I just wish we had MORE. I still feel like they’re kinda tokenized. S14 had several trans beauties but that was because half the damn season wasn’t out when they were cast. We maybe get one once in awhile and it’s like “here shut up here’s a woman” when trans women are so integral in drag scenes across the globe.
I’m going to need you to ELI5 how your questions are relevant to the point I was making, which is that this entire debate is bullshit.
Kennedy didn’t make Top 3 for the same reason Ginger didn’t win. It was because of untucked. The show wanted to push younger queens alongside their younger demographic and Ginger and Kennedy were primed by their pageant backgrounds to be edited in a way that made them look unaccepting of younger/newer forms of drag that gays were favoring around Season 7. Therefore, eliminating Kennedy felt like a triumphant elimination compared to Pearl, a fan and production fave who happened to be young.
I always take T like that with a grain of salt. Ilona stated they were told they couldn't talk about their identity because they were saving that storyline for the US show and yet their season featured quite a few moments of Ilona talking about it (I know Ilona isn't the most reliable storyteller either in this). I really don't think WOW is that heavily invested in the storylines playing out on other franchises, at least non-Ru franchises.
Gotcha.  Thank you
Mrs. Kasha Davis is an absolute sweetheart. She had clips from one of her shows she put on for kids on her Tik Tok and she had very Mr. Rogers energy going on and it was so sweet. The Davis family (both Mr. & Mrs.) are good people.
There’s always time for …. Being supportive and kind 😤😤😤
She is sweet, intelligent, compassionate, hilarious, and such a gift to the queer community. Queens like her are the queens that protect and nurture us. For her, you can tell drag is not just about getting attention, but about being a beacon for queer happiness and self expression. Love her so so so much. I want more queens like her in my life!
Goddess
I also seen all of her comments on Mimi’s instagram. She’s so sweet and supportive
Such a wonderful person!
She's one of my absolute favorite queens. I ordered a Cameo from MKD a few years ago when I was going through a difficult time and she put so much time and thought into it.
There's always time for a DM
She’s wonderful.
Should’ve won season 7
I adore Kasha Davis and always wanted to see her back again for All Stars. Hopefully the rumors about next season are true…
Love her
Well said!
I know it really warmed my heart :’)
She is one of my absolute favorites and did not deserve being out in the BOLB At all.
I love Bosco
I love this song and her! I wonder if the queens get to choose their own music/have influence over their numbers or if it’s all mostly pre-prepared when they sign on?
BOSCO!
Go on girl. Give us nothing.
Apologies for the terrible quality, I shot this on a potato
I wanna fucking tear her apart.
Me too
Actually this performance is like 5 minutes long and this little snippet is literally the first 20 seconds of it. She does much more later on.
This. That was the very beginning, you can tell because she still has the dress on and she does a burlesque routine lol I saw the whole thing on youtube and got my tickets right after cause I had to see it in person. I posted this clip cause I loved the song
Guess I’ll have to take your word for it 🤷‍♀️
You can look it up on youtube if you'd like lol I'm sure the full version is there somewhere
Of course I can Google more but if this is the example of being gagged over Bosco it’s maybe not the best clip to post.
Well maybe OP just wanted to share their excitement of being at the concert and seeing her live idk there's no harm in that, either way she's a great performer and can do much more than what was shown in that 20 second clip.
These comments. Go on girl. Give me nothing.
Lol why are you being mean for no reason? I'm not trying to come for you at all (?)
Being nasty online is not a personality.
She made it clear why she's one my favorites of all time.
I love her! The fact that this tour was US only is so upsettin'!
![gif](giphy|bgD8BT0XUFprtq85pe)
Marcia seems so supportive of all her castmates, it's very sweet!
Glad to hear Marcia backs Anetra. I was dreading it would be another Kameron Michaels situation. I can see Sasha and MIB getting most of the votes😆
Genuinely would give her Miss Congeniality, she seems like one of the kindest members of this cat. The excitement and love for her fellow queens’ performances always made me so happy. :) I’m glad you had such a wonderful time! And I’m super jelly you got to be at the finale, haha.
She's such a great queen!  Had a little chuckle at "endorsed" Anetra lol.
I’m happy for her but I can’t imagine how tough it must be to be doing jump splits to boss bitch every performance from now until the end of time.
ah i’m seeing her in a few weeks and this makes me so excited!!
She had my favorite exit line this season.. “Ow..! My heart..”
I missed seeing Marcia on my screen after her elimination. She just has a very energy about her.
Did she do a dive roll over the other herself of her that was in a backbend?  I figure since she's Marcia Marcia Marcia there can be up to three of her on stage at any given time.
Marcia have this great energy all through the season like she was happy to be there, happy to compete, happy for the experience, and whatever happens, happens. And it made her a delight to watch.
Sad I had to miss her but the shows have gotten so expensive so I have to pick and choose who I see now. 😭
Marcia is super charming and unfortunately has a horrible hateful fan base. She’s one of those queens that will 100% shine and thrive in and after All Stars.
She is so cute, I hope she goes very far in her career.
I was out of town when she stopped in my city of course! But I am so glad to hear how great she is live and in person. I really love this seasons queens!! She had a tweet a few weeks ago that every queen should preform let loose because of how fun it was - I’m happy she’s still doing it hahah!
Love miss sniffly nose
Marcia committing to her drag persona of being a basic straight white girl by endorsing Anetra 😍😍😍
Marcia is honestly cute out of drag. ![img](emote|t5_2t3or|8760)
❤️💃
Yeah, you can tell she’s a genuinely sweet person. I hope she comes back someday.
Yeah, her rationale was solid too. She first asked the audience what they thought. (For the record, Sasha got the most fan support. Anetra was a close second. Mistress was a distant third, and barely anyone clapped for Luxx.) Then she said something like, “I gotta be honest guys, I think Anetra deserves it. She kept up with a drag legend and to stand out the way she did?” Of course I cheered my ass off lol.  But all in all, you can tell that game respect game. Marcia knows she would have beaten literally anyone else on the face of the Earth in that lipsync, and she doesn’t hold any grudges.
What was the Kameron Michaels situation? Forgive me I forgot
Marcia is such a sweetheart! I’ll definitely support her in her future endeavors.  And I won’t ruin who won Miss Congeniality, but I wasn’t disappointed and hopefully you won’t be either.
lolol  She didn’t exactly tell us to vote for Anetra, but it was implied lol. No, the host asked her who she wanted to win. She started by crowdsourcing and asking us who we thought. Since Sasha got the most support, I thought she’d be diplomatic and agree with the crowd. But she said Anetra and I lost all my shit haha.  But you could tell she wanted to be congenial and not say what she really thought, and I respect her so much for giving her honest opinion.
I would think the hardest part would be the backwards upside down Exorcist crabwalk thing she does, but she totally committed and sold it.
This is how I feel about Anetra. Please walk less ducks and save your knees. And that ass split jump thing? Ouch. Marcia's back is going to hate her. I don't know how any of them do this, and I especially don't know how they do it repeatedly and make it seem fresh and amazing every time. It just adds to the enormous respect I have for them all.
Ahhhhh. Be sure to let us know how it goes. She may spill some tea once the season is over!
It broke something inside of me
A VERY very energy.
Luckily she is QUICK to shut those fans down when they say some shit out of line.
Let’s hope so! I’d be all over that lol
Yeah, Marcia, Anetra, and Spice (but not Sugar? I’m not sure how that works lol) were so cute out of drag!!
You could also tell they got quite close in the show. I think she mentioned something about it on whatcha packing. So they are probably good friends by now, which is always lovely to see. And she is right that Anetra was the only one who could keep up with a legend like Sasha which is truly amazing for someone who has about a quarter of the experience.
theyre probably referring to the reunion wherein no one among her castmates picked her to win… whereas aquaria, asia, and eureka were backed by at least one other queen from s10
Idk if this is like...objective science, but I think Sugar's face is somehow **too** symmetrical? Like overly perfect in a way that is subtly uncanny valley-esque?  I've been trying to understand why I think Spice is cuter too
Sugar is hot at lol. It’s interesting where Sugar & Spice are in their drag. But Sugar is the hotter twin lol.
His Instagram says “he/him” is good and “guy” is fine
That was so shitty. My heart sank while I was watching. Kameron was so sweet, such an incredible lipsync assassin. If I’d been a s10 Queen at that reunion and saw how it was going down, I’d have said Kameron was my pick to win.
That made me so sad to watch, I love Kameron
Sugar looks like she was manufactured at the boy band factory.
That makes sense. I hadn’t ever thought about it behind the surface level, but that makes total sense.  I was actually just discussing it with my bf, and he pointed out that I’m a big fan of hair lol. And I do vastly prefer Spice’s hair to Sugar’s.
Way too many people think shyness equals dullness or no personality, and I honestly think that ignorant opinion and the preoccupation the viewers have with messiness and 'drama' have held her back because they think she just 'doesn't deliver'.
It was also super shady of the editors to constantly cut back to Kameron during this section when Queens were naming their picks to win
Yes! It’s like, when a person who is perceived as being quiet or shy speaks up, it can be a jarring shift that might read as mean-spirited or insecure or unconfident.
Will there be enough queens for that though? Idk maybe I just don't remember all of them (eureka, kornbread, and from the uk veronica green and victoria scone)?
RPDR All Stars, “SO GOOD IT HURTS”
Océane Aqua-Black!
Only if Willam can join
I’m counting Deja and Jorgeous in this because they were eliminated due to the emergency of not having enough episodes left
I think a (non-elimination?) season of first outs would be more interesting, so they'd have their time to shine (and we'd see how they've improved their drag)
So a season of, like, 5 contestants?
my ankhol
Charlie Hide’s broken ribs is happy
I guess if we're talking emergency then Miss Cucu herself?
Ahh you’re right. I thought that there were more :(
makes sense. 🤭
Did Miss Cucu leave early due to her diagnosis? I thought she was eliminated fair and square, then diagnosed later.
Oh shit I knew I forgot someone lol, anyway that's still not enough people for an entire season, unless they make it into a short "special" or maybe add in some early outs?
Tbf, sounds shit either way.
Yup I kinda agree lol not enough meat on that season
Oh does Charlie Hides and his busted knee/broken ribs/diarrhoea count?!
I'm still not over the way that the first straight dude contestant walks into the werkroom and day 1, for his talent show, whips out a guitar for a little jam sesh.
Bruno does that to people. Got that simpático.
Bruno was especially big in season 14 tho.   Damn now I have to clean up myself
Straight…
i just noticed she's also possibly the only straight dude i use she/her on automatically
She's an ally!
![gif](giphy|KdC9M3oBSmMInys4SD|downsized)
...ally!
La LA RI dissasociating while they are arguing would be how I react too. I love her for that.
“I think you’re being arrogant right now girl” 😂
 Joey Jay was killing meee
Joey’s “what are you doing right now, girl…”
the close ups on lala ri have me dying
What I wanna know is why was Lala brushing a wig?
This is the closest untucked to interior illusions lounge drama and honestly we live for it
Funniest thing about this was Tamisha really threw a molotov once but it seemed like nothing caught fire when the girls said "thank you" so she did it again.
went from 0 to 100 in like seconds
Papa dissociating and staring off into space amidst a moment of confrontation is highly relatable
Why did Tamisha have to do that Ponzi scheme style behaviour after the show, I loved her so much lol
I actually enjoyed rewatching this
Rosé trying to build a sort of bridge and both ends just said nah let it burn
First time I watched this, I wasn't giving it my full attention so all I could think was poor miss Denali caught in all that drama but she can't talk because of that thing on her mouth but then homegirl laughed...
i didnt even catch that the first 100 times i watched this lmao!  "you guys can CALL it out"  "-- she just did  \-- i just did"
I enjoyed this with no sound on
This felt like an early season Untucked, and I mean this as the highest compliment possible
Unrelated note but i remember every girls name except for the one in red and yellow 😅  Edit: the replies are hilarious but just to make it clear i was not trying to be funny or shady, i just genuinely couldn't remember their drag name. All i could come up with was something like George but it didn't sound right to me for a drag queen 😅
That final "Oh my god." From Elliot with two T's unlocks my fight or flight response.
God I remember the discourse on here when this episode aired.  Whether you thought that Kandy was wrong to suggest that queens in the bottom didn't have star quality (ironic considering she was in the bottom the very next week) and to say that she was going to "pop off" if she didn't leave, or if you thought that Tamisha was wrong to say she didn't like some of the queens or to follow ("antagonise") Kandy after she was already leaving, there was just chaos everywhere.  Personally, Kandy was right to remove herself from a situation before she said or did something she would regret, but her suggestion that Tamisha didn't have star quality because she placed in the bottom didn't come across well.  Similarly, Tamisha feeling the need to say that she didn't like queens came out of nowhere, and there was no need to follow Kandy.
This was art.  That being said, i never personally understand why the contestants take the bait when someone says something shady to rile you up. Of course I have never been in the situation of reality tv competition lol but If someone i already didnt care for said they dont care for me as a person or as an artist….well i’d feel worse if they said the opposite lmao.
The off-center Tom Hopper director of Cats 🐈 editing lol
Joey Jay is a vibe
Why is everyone in the house of Aja like this?
This clip is making me question if “arrogant” is a real word anymore
Where’s Utica?!
"You talking, you looking at me, you talking about me?"  "You one."  Oop!
People get mad when the season is best friend’s race and then get mad when the girls have their moments like make it make sense
I remember the whole saga TIN network started and fell off and the drama with Monet. Ugh... so juicyyyyy .. oh and AlabamaStar gate is iconic !!!!! The after effect of s13 is amazing 😭😭😭.  I'm so happy that I lived thru all of that
THIS is television
Yeah the top girls from the premiere episode were acting SO unnecessarily superior towards the “porkchop” girls….Tamisha may have went about it the wrong way but im glad SOMEONE let them know….Team Tamisha!!! 😅
Tamisha got a mini stroke towards the end of the clip 🧐
i think tamisha tried to be very respectful in the way she said it but i do also think it was unnecessary
That’s a lot of talk for someone getting chased out of the room.
I love me some Kandy Muse but this moment, girl...she really couldn't let things go. Completely overreacted to what Tamisha said.
The LaLaRi face 🤣🤣
***YOU DON'T KNOW ME FROM A HOLE IN THE WALL***
Kandi is arrogant and her gang of mean girls just bloated that ego.
i’m really loving joey in this clip lol
Why are drag queens so catty and cunty? Lol it’s like someone has an opinion and these ppl take everything personally and immediately jump the gun and jump to conclusions and take things personally lol.    That first person said the other chick comes of arrogant.  The second chick said anyone who thinks anything of her should tell her right away.  Well the first girl just did and this is how the second chick acts.  If the second chick gets triggered everytime, who would want to say anything personal about her?! Lol
“Take her out”
i just hate gottmik “tamisha leave her alone” thing
Kandi hit me up on Grindr in Jersey City last year and I was like “Nah, girl. You’re too much.” She blocked me.
The song Tamisha made out of this that was shown on the reunion was so funny and iconic tho 😭😭
Little girl, Little girl....I still use this on my friends to gwt their attention
I'm not gonna be too many bitches, little girl
I said what I said
xD some of the girls not just in this season thinks they are not being arrogant. That is because no one calls them out, and when somebody does they feel very attacked!  So definitely no ones gonna call them out if they keep reacting aggresively.
I like what joey said
joey was really "i saw the fishnets and they were ripped" during this fight.
Come on, this a great line to start any meeting or zoom call...... 🤭🤭🤭
Little girl!
![gif](giphy|55itGuoAJiZEEen9gg)  La la Ri be like
'I'm in the bottom'  😅
Omg and then Utica at the end making a futile attempt to help reattach those floppy paper bags💀
"I'm in the bottom!" is right up there with "Can't we just bottle up our feelings like normal people?!" for my all time favorite reactions to Untucked fights.
The first gay icon!
She asked for it
Same considering she had a thing for Joey lmao
Me to myself every day
She was so brave for interrupting her
They literally made me laugh out loud. So good
It’s her hiding under the couch cushions.
‘Oh shit … here Tamisha go … look busy y’all’
She was trying to soothe herself back down to earth so she could lipsink after disassociating so hard lol
I really, REALLY need untucked to get as unhinged as it used to get. I barely pay attention to it now because it's just people being nice to one another.   I NEED the drama!
![gif](giphy|vgmQsE2D7ujNeCJrOZ|downsized)  I mean we had this moment at least
This was her lifeline, she was trying to serve drama so that they would keep her and it worked
Yeah lol. I think she said something like that she feeds on negative energy afterwards and watching it the 2nd or 3rd time you can totally see this is what she was going for
Papa 💀
Papa Li
Truly lost it with this comment. Bless.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the stage: Papa Ni\~
She really fumbled so much good will, I feel like the fans adored her until her little antics popped off
Seriously!!! Like whyyyy??? Won’t lie, I’m wearing my tamisha iman slides rn that I got like 2-3 weeks after ordering. Idk where things went wrong but fuck, I loved her. If only she had hired someone to handle her merch sales…..
We wanted her to be everything Sasha Colby is being right now.
Is the Tamisha Iman Network still around?
Me too! It's crazy how much people were on Tamisha's side when this aired but Kandy looks justified here.
You can still tell it’s drama 🎭
tina burner
Richard Simmons
Ronald McDonald
Graham Norton's Ex
Wow, the way you just ended her career
Lmao damn. Imagine being a drag queen for over 20 years, creating a huge name for yourself in New York nightlife, auditioning for Drag Race for years and you finally get cast and had so little impact on the show that a person on Reddit calls you "the one in red and yellow"
Spice from 20 years in the future
I love that no one was completely in the right in this situation. The girls simply got messy, iconic behavior erupted and we got this gem for eternity
I remember on the clip on youtube, there’s some cringy ass comments about how Tamisha is following her menacingly, how her stance indicates she’s ready to fight and how if someone looks at you like that you better back away. Like what?
> Tamisha feeling the need to say that she didn't like queens came out of nowhere  She wanted to be saved from bottom 2 and it worked for her
If someone is saying some rude shit about me to my face, I'm going to tell them to shut the fuck up at the very least.
Historically, they’ve kept a hot-headed, unlikable underperformer up until or immediately prior to the finals, so being reactive can pay off!
Honestly, I agree with you. I would Raven/Tatianna my way to the finale where I keep quiet in front of the queens then release my inner bar queen and talk shit of everyone in the confessional.
Hahahahahahah
Oh if Tamisha came at me gun blazing like that out of nowhere, I would like to fight please
To be fair, Tamisha definitely started it 😂
Sitting behind LaLa and trying to stay out of the line of fire.
Her and Denali were vibing in the back while the girls in the front were getting their lives
She didn't hesitate one second, I live
Don’t ask questions you aren’t ready to hear the answers to
It's more backhanded than the back of my hand 🤣
That’s Top 4 behavior, tho…when could Tamisha Iman, of Tamisha Iman Network fame, ever?
So you would’ve kept it cute in her place? “I don’t like you and I think you’re arrogant but you turned it” is a back-handed compliment at most. It was shade and deserved at least a fight over it
I think you’re starting to get it
Maybe this show is not for you
🤣🤣
They do say she’s “too much” any way or another. Kornbread describes it as a beer can 💩
“There’s a lot of people in this meeting I don’t like-“
She died at stonewall
She was bottling up her emotions like Miss Brooke Lynn Hytes  ![gif](giphy|hRxI1YuUhVKEZqsIax|downsized)
I need the petty cat fight of S5 back, not the "I think your drag is so amazing and you're such a beautiful person..". Hell no.
Maybe when fans don’t send death threats and other rotten comments to the queens… just maybe
It was our moment and we had it
People go on and on about this argument but it would have been like, a relatively uneventful episode of Untucked on S2-5.
NOT AUTOCORRECT TURNING HER INTO PAPA  EDIT IM SOBBING AND ROLLING
Papa Pi for UK S6
PAPA
🛑 ✋ HALT   Absolutely not Papa Li for Season 16
Truth lol. She genuinely could've gotten huge and been the season's biggest fan favourite but YIKES, that merch mishap and her fall-out with WoW...
I love Sasha "Dumbledore" Colby, but she's on a totally different vibe to Tamisha "I said what I said" Iman
She wishes. Tamisha never really was as iconic as Sasha in her 30+ years of doing drag. Her drag daughter Tandi was more iconic than she ever was.
She threw a tantrum over someone pointing out she was being "arrogant" and physically threatened another contestant but she's justified? Sure Jan.
Ah yes, thank you.
The smokiest eye in New York
I love her, but I mean…Tamisha *did* start it…
True, no one was in the right in this situation.
She can def respond however she wants but it’s funny how the house of Aja are verrrrry similar personalities. You don’t always see that happen.
Yeah, I don't know many people who wouldn't have popped off at Tamisha for that BS. You can't just be like "You're arrogant and I don't like you" and expect peace and love.
LMAO
What do you mean when.  You just saw it.  Ms Muse tucked tail and ran.  Tamisha, of the Tamisha Iman Network, ate her for lunch and spit her out.  Poor Candy couldn’t even keep a train of thought going.  If Tamisha makes easy work of you, well….🤷🏻‍♀️
I would have told Tamisha "Your make up is crusty, your wig is thirsty and your outfit is telling me you've only been doing drag for five minutes," then walk off.
That would be a gossip for years at any office..., 🤭
LMAO this comment is sending me
Brooke wore me out during that fight!
Giving me Jim Halpert realness.
PAPA RI
Me fucking too thank you for this
That doesn't cover 10% of the stuff she tried to pull
Girl, it's so obvious Tamisha was trying to stir up something here so that they could save her from the bottom 2. It worked out in her favor
Idk why this shit made laugh, but I fully lost it. So thank you.
Yeah she did start this fight but if Kandy’s attitude wasn’t so horrible it wouldn’t of happened in the first place.
Tea
But she prefaced that with saying everyone did good drag, just like when Luxx called Loosey basic it was fine because she started with saying she did good drag /s
No I meant, when could Tamisha Iman, of Tamisha Iman Network fame, exude Top 4 behavior with those thirsty-ass wigs, bad garments and bad attitude?
Iconic tbh
***"No tea l thought u were gonna be in the bottom for this look"*** was the prelude to Yvie ending Silky in like 4 sentences HAHAHAHA. "***Let's give a pad in the back to mediocrity and beans"*** lives in my head rent free
I can’t believe you all are out here living for Papa while I’m dying for Papa 😩😭💔
this one autocorrected comment is about to be my 13th reason i s2g *why Papa*
I mean… Tamisha was correct though.
It made me laugh because didn't she only wore red, yellow, and orange because of her name? 🤣
Idk if *horrible* is the right word. More like *iconic* to me
More like *desperate*
Prefacing this by saying I love Kandy, but her behavior was definitely both haha that's why we love her 🖤
How does she always look this good. So sad I had to miss out on her coming to Boston. How was the performance?
I love Sasha's smoky pageant eye makeup, but she looks SO good in bronzey earth tones. The beauty!
Stunning. Absolutely stunning!!!!
If I can meet her in person I would definitely tip a 100 😭
She is absolutely gorgeous!!!
Does anyone know where she'll be tonight?
Damn that’s a pretty decent KDA
r/AccidentalRenaissance
UNREAL. I posted 2 videos you can watch. She promised to first make us sob and then make us hard, and darling, she delivered!
She’ll be in providence ri tomorrow night
Right. Makes me think she'll be in one of those cities tonight for watch party?
Early Drag Race now feels like a whole other show with different stakes, queens coming in with different purposes, and a totally different audience.   Quite a lot of the runways that worked in early seasons would be considered low-effort trash now. And the “realness” of being bitchy or confrontational from early seasons would never fly these days.   So it’s not really possible to say who might have done just as well or much better/worse with such dramatically different environments. Many challenges could have tripped up the eventual winner of any season, so change some variables and all bets are off.
I feel like Manila and Alaska (who were runner ups in their regular season) could have won a newer regular season without Raja and Jinkx as competitors
So Drag Race is *not* the Olympics of drag, but something it has in common with sports at that level is that things have improved dramatically across the board over time. In many cases, the athletic performance that won a gold medal in 1900 would not even have qualified for the Olympics in the 2020s. Drag Race has a much shorter timescale, but the same principle applies, particularly on the runway: someone with meh 2023 runways would often have been one of the top runway performers on the earliest seasons. We've come *that* far. Likewise, a C+ Snatch Game in 2023 would often have competed for a win in the early 2010s. That sort of thing.  And because performances have improved so much over time, it's kind of boring to compare them. Like, yeah, the 22-year-old who grew up watching the show and has spent the last decade of their life consciously preparing for this very moment is gonna be better than the contestants who had literally no context for how drag queens would come across on TV. It's not an interesting observation.  A more interesting question: who survives S7?  See, S7 has several specific hurdles:  * Shakesqueers: only actual talented actors make it out alive * The DESPY Awards: how's your public speaking? * Ru Hollywood Stories: steal the spotlight while delivering a familiar character (literally Michelle Visage!) * Conjoined Queens: share the spotlight while doing recognizable character work * Divine Inspiration: hope you can sing live booboo * Prancing Queens: intense dancing duets where production can't hide you behind anybody else * and the Hello Kitty Ball: a design challenge at final 5, so forget about hiding in the crowd  So. Who survives?  Let's talk about the top half of S14:  * Daya Betty is through to the finale no questions asked. * Willow Pill might struggle with Ru Hollywood Stories, but *probably* makes it through this gauntlet. * If Lady Camden can make it through Ru Hollywood Stories (Director: "Bigger! No, BIGGER! **EVEN BIGGER**!", she has a great shot at making it to the end. * If Angeria can make it past Shakesqueers, she's got a smooth ride to Prancing Queens. If she survives that, she's through to the finale. * Bosco's gonna kick ass all the way to Prancing Queens and then vanish. No way she makes it through. * Jorgeous will be on her third or fourth lip sync by the time she *gets* to Conjoined Queens, and at that point the odds just aren't in her favour. * And I actually feel like DeJa Skye has pretty good odds of roaring though this competition as far as the ball. But that's where her journey ends.  To talk through a few more finalists:  * Rose does great! * Gottmik has a pretty solid run (Ru Hollywood Stories is a bit bumpy, but the cast is still large enough to give her some protection), and then Prancing Queens sends her straight out the door. * Kandy Muse powerhouses her way through the first half, but from Divine Inspiration onward, it's flop after flop until production sends her home. * Crystal Methyd has a slow start, but from Conjoined Queens onward it's a fuckin' buffet up in here, om nom nom. * Gigi Goode bodies challenge after challenge. * Between Shakesqueers, Ru Hollywood Stories and Divine Inspiration, Brooke doesn't make it to the dais. * If A'keria survives Shakesqueers, she's in a great position to go all the way. * Silky gets a one-two punch during those back-to-back spotlight challenges. (Too big for Hollywood Stories, then doesn't do enough to feature her Conjoined partner.) If she survives, we'll have to see how she does at the ball, but her odds are actually okay.  And, finally, some winners:  * Willow might struggle with Ru Hollywood Stories, but beyond that she's got a smooth enough run. * Symone eats from start to finish. * Jaida Essence Hall gets fucked up by those early acting challenges, and also gets a rough run at Divine Inspiration. The odds aren't in her favour. * If Yvie makes it through Shakesqueers, there's no stopping her. * Aquaria's in the same boat as Jaida. * We'll have to see how Sasha does in Prancing Queens, but beyond that she's pretty stacked. * And as for Roberta, she's gonna mop the competition right up to the ball, when things get dicey. (But it'll be her first time in the bottom, so... maybe!)
honestly any of the current top 4 would dominate season 1-4 easily. i could especially see luxx being seen as insanely impressive by ru. however, drag culture has transformed so much it's not fair or sensical to compare them. like bebe wouldn't have been the bebe we saw if she was born later and started drag now. queens back then couldn't learn about drag through social media, and made wayyyyy less.
Kasha Davis would have won season 1 and The Princess could have won a newer season (8-11)
Sasha is a dancer dancer so no doubt she would slay a dancing challenge
Hmm Luxx in Season 1 would have been (does the math)... 10. And MiB... 11.   I would watch that! OMG baby Luxx and MiB would be hilarious XD
Poverty.
She has struggled with health issues for quite a while.
Not only is she a prime example of Drag Race isn't a success for everyone. She was initially cast for AS4 and spent a good chunk of change getting ready but failed the health evaluations before hand and they just had her cameo a bit.   I feel bad for Stacey I don't know what the solution can be for her...
Just because you were on Drag Race doesn't mean you're forever rich.
I feel really bad for Stacey. Maybe there just aren't enough bars around where she lives since it's a small town or maybe they don't hire her enough but she needs a source of income. WOW should help her out w/giving her a job on their youtube channel or on the show to help her.
I thought this was about Stacy the drag race Canada judge
I didn’t know that oh my god
Not to be rude or nosey, but has she shared what health problems she's been facing?
Oh dang that’s really awful
Yeah I don’t think that, she just kind of fell off and then returned and I’ve seen some posts where people said she scammed them, I’m just trying to know what’s going on
OP literally used her full name, where is the confusion?
Just...the way you worded your post was very judgemental. And now you're like "omg i didn't know that." Just assume that SLM is obviously struggling and try to be a bit sensitive?
I don't know but [she was in the hospital a couple years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/rupaulsdragrace/comments/mhqrlp/stacy_layne_matthews_landed_in_hospital_without/).
Yeah it's why Manila always tries to give her shout outs, but at this point almost everyone has tried to give her shout outs, heck I think even WOW on her birthday posted her usual Cash App post, insisting they tip Stacey.
I cackled.
Manila has consistently been sweet that’s really nice of her and just so shitty for Stacey, I have seen a couple comments on her posts saying she scammed people but idk what’s true there
I did not recognize Raven :o
I find it hilarious how Anetra is breaking records with likes and views on instagram and youtube, when she also competing with Princess Poopy for the least amount of social media posts😂
My favourite thing about Anetra's social media is the little burst of posting we get every time someone gently reminds her she's (probably) contractually obligated to Have A Presence
Trixie being most fan voted to win then getting hate when it happens 😍
Season 9’s was Sasha. Just wanted to say it since it’s missing
Not the jumpscare at the end 💀
All these queens competing against eachother in a season would be FIRE MAMA, who do you think would win?
Anetra really pulled ahead with the likes, but Sasha was neck and neck the first couple of days.
I didnt know yvie was the fan fave then!!!
Team Pearl?  ![gif](giphy|3og0IFBAhrfyl2gCGY)
My early favourite has only ever won one season (Bob) for regular season and one season (Alaska) for All Stars. If Sasha wins that'll be another favourite winning.
Gotmik was the favorite?? Really did not expect that.
Gotmik was the favorite?? Really did not expect that.
Why did season fourteen have such fewer votes?
Is there any reason why Willow's like count pales in comparison to the other seasons AS3 and later? I remember last year the season didn't have a ton of engagement and it was blamed on less people using Instagram now, which doesn't seem to be the case.
This is not to be shady but I was surprised to see Crystal in this lineup, considering that Jaida was such an icon and that Gigi won so many challenges.  Good for her!
ugh, this reminds me of Raven's gorgeous AS1 finale look😩
To this day I still don't understand Bianca's last minute pedestal hair being top tier and never ever referencing it again(like this was an editing mistake right?...)
What is sasha's IG post like count at? Instagram doesn't show like counts for me.
People will believe what they want to feed their narrative and preference. There’s no right or wrong answer. Not one that will sway anyone anyways. Personally, I can’t wait to see the aftermath of next week. Bring out the popcorn!
So what’s the likelihood of being crowned if you’re the favorite to win (excluding season 15)? Too sick and lazy to calculate right now. 😅
Rupaul’s all stars drag race 💀💀💀
TEAM PEARL PLSSSSS
Pearl? Really??
It’s Sasha’s crown to lose yall and has been all season
I love Sasha, but tbh, it feels like production and hardcore drag fans are forcing the narrative for Sasha to win just because of her pre-Drag Race legacy and achievements. It shows with Anetra getting more social media support because it feels like she worked hard to earn the crown with her Drag Race journey. But thats just my opinion, no hate to Sasha if she wins anyway.
Gotmik being the season's favorite and production wrigging the whole season for her to be in the top 4 does not bode well with me.  It's as if it doesn't matter at all what a girl can do on the show anymore.
Wow to see much the fandom doesn't like Trinity anymore is crazy
Okay, but, are we not going to talk about how this basically proves that S14 was the worst season we've ever had to endure? Front runner had the least votes since All Stars 2 which was fully 7 years ago when this was still a Logo show. And yes there was a Top 5 but that whole season just felt flat, endless and empty.
How in the world was trixie the favorite to win all stars 3 😭 like even if you like trixie that makes no sense, it would be like wanting Ellie Diamond to win uk 2🙈
Eew. Team Pearl? Love her now but Ging and Violet were way better scoring on their seasons
This bodes well for my Anetra winning scenario, as most of the other queens in this post did actually win their seasons
Seeing Raven on this just feels right
That girl can do no wrong. She is adored and her make up skills are legendary
Not Princess Poopy 😂😭
She really is that bitch
She’s cultivating mystery. Catch her at the bar (or on all stars)
WOW SHE BEAT CRYSTALS LIKES!
Her stories are pretty busy from what I have seen.
Meanwhile three cities chanted winner at Sasha 😭
honestly this sub would have a similar reaction if anetra won
Tbh that's probably thanks to the jury twist.  Trixie is an excellent queen and absolutely deserved a crown but the twist made it come across as unearned to a lot of people.   In general I find it pretty funny how often queens seem to get hate for decisions entirely out of their control.
Favorite to win before or after shangela was eliminated lol
This is a current print screen and doesn't represent the feeling at the time. Rajah has the most support on AS6
Thank you! I couldn’t find it when I was scrolling Instagram
jinkx cakewalks and the others compete for 2nd 😍  edit: i didn't see bianca i'd put her 2nd with 30% chance of overtaking jinkx so everybody else is 3rd sadly
Bobs not there but she’s def be top
Apparently at the live finale, the audience reaction to her was so unbalanced that they had to ask people to cheer louder for the others so they could create a balanced enough edit of the finale. Yvie was adored
She totally stole the narrative, in a good way.
Who else would it be lol
Not sure if you watched Season 7, but Pearl was a huge fan favorite, especially compared to Violet and Ginger. I believe Kim Chi also had the most votes for her season.
The edit managed to turn a lot of people off both Violet and Ginger by the finale. One of the many weird things with S7 and probably a big part of why it was regarded as the worst season for quite a while
Violet and Ginger were not well received. People got behind Pearl because the show was obviously fucking with her and by finale she seemed over it. Violet came across like Violet and Ginger was a gutter troll in Untucked. Pearl was soft and sweet compared.
The season of thirst if I recall correctly. Ru should have carried through with the implied threat on stage involving Katya.
Yeah Pearl was the only one who wasn’t seen as evil and annoying. If Katya was an option she probably would have received over 90% of support, she was the true favourite when it was airing.
Pearl was very cool, she has a natural ease while also being fierce that made people like her. I was rooting for her to win at the time
That’s the face I made @ Raven
I loved pearl lol
She had no business lasting to the finale
I’ve been blessed cause for regular seasons all my faves have won from season 10 onwards. The last time I remember being disappointed was when Ra’jah didn’t win AS6. This year is hard cause I love Anetra and Sasha so much. I think Anetra would really have to pull out something crazy to win though and I’d be surprised if Sasha hasn’t planned something amazing herself.
The fans didn’t start turning on Gotmik until after their behavior off the show.
Is having a fifth finale queen could have undermined the numbers of vote ?
I think all the non elimination episodes made people stop watching towards the end, or at least be less engaged with the show
I actually think the season got more engagement on Twitter, I’m working on a Twitter version of this post right now and Willow is one of the most liked Team Posts from Twitter in all the seasons
Gigi fell really out of favor with public opinion after the political debate episode because she expressed that she wasn't involved in politics and a lot of people disliked that. It was actually neck and neck between Crystal and Jaida due to this, but Crystal won less challenges than Jaida and the LSFTC was Jaida's to win
180,000 or something close to it.
If anything, I think it shows how predictable it is that fans will often support the queen who has been very clearly given the ‘underdog’ edit. I wouldn’t say Sasha has been pushed outside of receiving the requisite praise for doing as well as she has on this season.
Sasha did also do extremely well throughout the competition. I don't think anyone came close to her
Why are so many fans so quick to diminish Sasha’s run because of her name tho? She did amazing and although 2 of her wins were controversial, she also could’ve (and should’ve tbh) won some other challenges like the girl groups one. Sasha undeniably did an amazing job and although Anetra and Mistress are my favourites of the season, Sasha deserves it the most.
people love a good underdog story
It should be fairly obvious that all the frontrunners worked hard to attempt to earn the crown, Sasha just makes it look easy.
maybe the keep Anetra for an All Stars crown. As she helped to gain viral views, maybe she will help for viewing and subscriptions while being cast in an All Stars season
But that's narrative and editing... right? Right?...
I just watched S14 directly before S15 and find 15 much worse. I can't really bring myself to care about anyone really. I see the talent, but meh.
Season 14 had more engagement on Twitter than Instagram. Willow has one of the most liked Team Posts on Twitter ever, and Season 14 on IMDb has 2 of the top 5 highest rated episodes ever, and has the highest rated episodes of any season since season 9, so not really. I’d say season 14 is way more loved than season 15
It was like a year a half into UnnnnHh. She was the viral queen 🫅
In a shocking twist, popularity helps win popularity contests
Don't underestimate her fans
Mama did you even watch all stars?? She was *literally* in the bottom for HALF the season and won exactly ZERO challenges  Are you crazy?? Or are you just repeating "Raven was robbed" for no reason???
Tyra dominated Season 2, nobody was on her level. People use the argument that "Tyra was shitty to the other queens" but Raven was awful too, especially to Mystique and Tatianna.
Crystal winning over JAIDA and GIGI is truly an opinion of all time  Also Raven has 0 wins in All Stars 1, not even 1 and has been in the bottom multiple times, if anyone was robbed that season, it was Shannel
I have to disagree very harshly,  Tyra Sanchez won Season 2 fair and sqaure (had the most wins, best runways - slayed the competition). Chad also won All Stars fair and square (had the most wins, great runways). Raven had zero wins, and like three bottoms in All Stars, she was never going to win and shouldn't have. She also constantly does close to blackface.  Jaida Essence Hall was the rightful winner of Season 12, and was also creative, talented and unique. The essence of beauty. Love Crystal though shes an amazing queen and should win All Stars one day.
Raven fans are wild and if anyone shouldve won 12 over Jaida it was Gigi.
I think Raven is incredibly talented. I found her more interesting, charismatic and unique than the winners of her seasons.   And I think Jaida & Gigi are both deserving of a season 12 win but I personally found Crystal’s looks and overall perspective on drag more interesting than the other 2. Her growth and confidence was also really impressive. And she seemed like a warm and lovely person. We’re all entitled to our opinions without being called “crazy”.
"she can do no wrong." While the pic is literally indigenous face
No they wouldn't? Lmao Trixie's win was tainted to the fans by the jury twist taking Shangela out of the running. If Sasha was somehow not in the top 2 and Anetra won, mayyybe I could see that, but even then I think Anetra is seen as more of a frontrunner/contender this season than Trixie was on AS3 so I think people would still be okay with her win, just upset Sasha didn't get the chance (like they were with Fiercalicious).
Did you watch AS3?
Before
Then why don't the other ones retroactively have more likes? Katya and Bianca have tons of hardcore fans, theirs should at least be at 100,000
Based off the post someone did a few days ago, Shea and Kim were winning their polls
Who would win snatch game?
I was there and I don’t remember that. They make us cheer out of context anyway so they can edit it in wherever it best fits.
Brooke was not too far behind and is well like by the Fandom.
what would you say is the worst season now, just out of curiosity
Thats crazy, Violet had this amazing glow up in how they showed warmth and interacted, I was convinced. The whole package
So basically, they were the MIB and Luxx to Pearl's Loosey😂
I just was really excited for Gotmik at the beginning and then just meh during the show. Not mad, just no longer excited at all. And it seemed like Symone was so loved.
just say her name rhymes with pilot
I forgot all about this!  You’re so right.
Okay so pretty close but not as close as they were
How are TTT, Shea, Bianca underdogs exactly?
Yeah, even if you swap out her 2 controversial wins and give her the girl group win, she'll still have the best track record even without production favoritism.
It's not even that, it feels like people sometimes praise her because "it's Sasha and she's great", which is fine when she is doing well but it seriously feels like that one Anetra segment in the heaven add thingy sometimes. And like 0 negative critiques at any point. Idk the constant over the top positive comments about everything she touches make me feel like a crazy person.  And I hated how all of the metal group did rap basically, I'd give it to someone in the country group since they made it sound like country, especially Luxx and Marcia. Oh and Loosey because she did a character voice and looked great.
Indeed. Some people, like Sasha, just sail through the competition. \~\~
it's exactly this. if it was a shangela-trixie lip sync and trixie did some insane shit to pull off the win, no one would have a problem with it. think of sasha winning season nine -- that finale Was Shea's Crowning Moment.... until they did the lip syncs. there's still a vocal minority that believes shea was robbed but overwhelmingly more people acknowledge that sasha took it. the problem was never that trixie won its that her win felt gifted and undeserved. if in a week from now Something Happens and the *chance* to compete is taken from sasha and anetra (or especially one of the other two) wins, people are gonna have some words and feelings about it
Bianca won so long ago that the instagram posts exists only printed in history books
I can assure you Sasha was first with Shea as a close second
The fans because that would honestly be some of the best ten minutes of television in existence
Jinkx, Bianca didn't even win season 6
I haven't seen much less rewatched all of them, but maybe the fact that I started and didn't finish S11 says something
Season 11 was deemed the worst regular US season after that and now I see people saying season 13 is the worst.
Season 13. Objectively and subjectively the worst season!
Funny how you left out, Kylie, Pearl, Crystal, Willow, Trixie and even Raven and Katya to an extent
Don’t know how much sense it makes, but I feel like that one time most season winners were in the bottom made their run more relatable and complete.  Ps.: I still like Sasha
Oh, apparently she's sailing now.
Comments like these puts people off of Sasha. Mention a shining moment of hers on the show. I’ll wait!
This is what I’m basing my data on https://www.reddit.com/r/rupaulsdragrace/comments/12918oy/season_15_initial_instagram_poll_results/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1
I’m dead at this mama😭🤣
what about You mary, in your personal opinion
I was making a point that fans do not OFTEN support underdogs. You want me to name all winners? Lol
Ok, so Sasha’s advantage might have been on Twitter? ‘Cause I’m quite sure she was the fan favourite in at least one of the social platforms
me? 14, the production was way too heavy handed. youre either gonna hate the cast or hate the production, 11 i think most people were just put off by the girls and the odd animosity among them all. plastique was just on PS saying she isnt sisters with anyone from her season. brooke and scarlet had that uncomfortable weird tension. but as for 14 there was too much nonsense going on. june had every right to be pressed being eliminated when they brought orion back no questions asked then also introduced yet another scheme to bring back an eliminated girl. that and a final 5... really girl that's half the cast
For me it’s 3, but I know that’s just my opinion and a lot of people love that season. For me it was just too childish to be entertaining tbh.
I think it was twitter
Not just a final 5, but they had to do a double elimination the episode before to get it to five with one competitive episode before the finale to go, and still chose to do another double save.  I actually didn't care who won...I just wanted it to be over.
Actually on Broadway? Pretty much zero chance because theatre space is limited and hella expensive for productions to rent out. Plus there's a ton of union rules that I assume WOW wouldn't care for.
Is love to see Synthia Kiss in something like this. Her voice is amazing!
Main Cast: Peppermint, Milan, Brita, Alexis Michelle, Jan, Rosé, Marcia, Blair St. Clair, Tina Burner, Lemon  Rotating Limited Runs: Jinkx, DeLa, Courtney, Ginger, Nina West, Bianca, Monet, Divina DeCampo, Vinegar Strokes, Cheryl Hole, Kitty Scott Claus, Ella Vaday
👀🤯 I would like to see it
There is so much drag in NYC already, plus the competition from Broadway shows. Different competitive landscape than Vegas. Would never fly. But fun to think about!
I know people don't seem to like her, but Veronica has a longer CV in legit musical theatre than most of the UK queens in your rotation.
The MacBitch performance in Shakesqueer, Season 7 Episode 3. Certifiably iconic cringe.  Also iconic cringe: the bottom 3 performances in the All Stars 4 Episode 1 talent show. Holy shit I rewatch these regularly.   Actual uncomfortable cringe: talk show challenge on Season 6 Episode 9. It’s one of those challenges where no one really does well.
I will never forgive them for that 6 way lipsync on 11
All Stars 5 was a cringe fest for me
Not a season but the way Kendall Gender speaks in her talking heads is always so cringe for me.
The roasts and standups will always have some of the most cringe moments. They can be iconic cringe or just outright car crash cringe. Examples that I can remember on top of my head are Alyssa's roast (S5), Dela's standup (S6), Farrah/Alexis' roast (S9), and Utica's roast (S13).
AS1 - Teams you couldn't choose before the season started so queens couldn't prepare coordinating looks. Also not being able to be in full control of your performance since your partner that you didn't get to choose beforehand can bring you down with theirs. The LSFYL emergency button that was really more self-sabotaging than anything.
Overall, season 11. The tension and lack of chemistry among the queens was cringe.
Season 14 Snatch game.. and then there’s usually 1-2 snatch game contestants who are a cringe fest as well… looking @ you Spice (Miley Cyrus S15)
Season 7 had a bunch of cringeworthy acting challenges 🫣
seconding this
![img](emote|t5_2t3or|4847)
I really believed all of this and that Anetra would be the winner... until last week when Sasha just smashed it so hard. I do believe it will be Sasha now.
> Sasha doesn't need a crown to prove herself.  to YOU. if she didn't feel like she didn't want and/or need the crown and the title of america's next drag superstar, why would she even bother spending thousands of dollars on outfits and risking her reputation and status by joining the show?  her deserving the crown the most goes beyond wins (though jinkx's win on as7 and symone's on s13 are pretty good examples of recent occasions that challenge wins mattered, to answer your question lol), she came with high expectations, not only met them but she was even able to succeed them. she's got the looks, the performances, the comedy, the charisma and the star quality! what else is there to ask?   and on top of all that, she's a great representation for trans people at times that trans people are being chased by far right politicians/media.
>Sasha doesn’t need a crown to prove herself.  This analysis sucks we've seen that premise not come to fruition before on S6.  Sasha did the best. Crown that hoe.
Sasha doesn’t need the crown but she has rightfully shown why she deserves it.

no. as an Anetra stan (Sasha too), Sasha deserves this crown. i don’t think it’s up to you to decide whether she needs it or not because if she’s put so much effort into competing she clearly wants it and she’s hands down earned it regardless. plus it’s not a ‘who needs it the most’ competition  Anetra is amazing but she definitely has room for growth and i’d love to see her elevate her drag even more and come back to all stars with more confidence, she could absolutely win. plus she’s the fan favourite and is going to be booked and busy so she doesn’t really need it either  this just feels like Sasha’s time to me and i think she’s the queen we need right now. she’s competed so flawlessly in every aspect of the competition but also with all the anti-drag + trans laws rn she’s just the perfect representative for the crown and that’s the cherry on top. she was shut out from competing on drag race for years due to the show’s transphobic policies so considering this and how she’s exceeded expectations i feel like she’s the only choice
I don’t know. To me, the storyline for Anetra really lends itself to amping her up for becoming an All Stars Powerhouse. Anetra and Sasha both KILLED it this competition, but storyline wise Anetra has more room for growth where as Sasha had a practically perfect/ polished run. And that in general makes me see Anetra coming back for All Stars and absolutely demolishing the competition.
Vanessa van Cartier didn't need it either and she still won.
Sasha, the queen who was told by WOW production they would never cast her because she’s trans and has openly discussed how much that affected her professionally and personally, doesn’t “need” the crown?  K.
Sasha’s 100% winning, and I say this as an Anetra fan (her time will come soon enough though).
winners get people making these types of posts about them. they are the discourse.  ![gif](giphy|4GV56sOOUJGyVdDWGw)
Nah I’m over the narrative that the underdog winning is the better storyline. Just maybe the legend who dominated the season should actually be crowned? That, at least imo, is far more satisfying.   I’d say Anetra is far more likely than Sasha to return for All Stars, so crown Sasha now and Anetra can come back and win AS9. Sorted ✅
That is not an informed analysis.   You better werkshop that some more.
An analysis that has you commenting “Oh I didn’t consider X, Y, or Z” on nearly every other comment doesn’t seem too informed to me.   As many other people have said, Sasha SHOULD have been on the show much earlier (and still would have demolished), but that opportunity was taken from her. She spent time, money, and effort, just like everyone else, to compete now and gain an elevated platform amongst drag artists. She’s just as “hungry” as everyone else, if not more so. It’s her time, she has performed EXCEPTIONALLY, and she deserves the crown. As someone in another comment said, this isn’t RuPaul’s “who needs it most” race. This is a drag competition show and she unequivocally crushed the competition.   At a time when drag, queer people, and trans people are being threatened simply for existing, we need someone to represent the platform. Who better than a trans WOC who is living in her truth and has fought her entire career to be included?  Sometimes the obvious choice is the best choice, even if it’s “boring”.
Please i can't handle one more week like this
Some y’all anetra fans be so pressed over how great Sasha is it’s funny, I literally been watching y’all spiral week by week. Please give your brains a break from mental gymnastics class and breatheeee😂🥴  no shade all tea.
We’re all assuming it’s Sasha v Anetra. Remember it’s a final 4 not a final 2. Mistress and Luxx are also able to turn it out in performance!   2 will make it to the LSFTC. In my opinion the best of the night should make it to the final 2. If that doesn’t happen most will cry RIGGA MORRIS.   I hope the final 2 are deserved. If shenanigans are pulled to push a story line and they aren’t rightfully earned, imagine what would happen if they win the whole thing.   I’m team Sasha and I hope she demonstrates why she deserves to LSFTC and ultimately win. But whoever wins, they better be deserving for how they perform or it’ll be crazy!  For analysis purposes: Sasha is already a star, yes, her crowning also propels her to a bigger stage. Given political climate and transphobia (even within the drag race community) her crowning couldn’t come at a much more needed time.   Anetras comparison to Adore is perfect. Loved by fans, rooted for even, but still growing and coming into her own.
I am so Team Anetra but Sasha will win and she deserves it all. I know Anetra has the most fans but game must recognize game. And Sasha is ALLL game
I'll be happy to see either Anetra or Sasha win -  I'm seeing them live in Australia in a couple months, so psyched
>!after being nosey and seeing who the top 2 are!<  , I can see it. It’s so closeee. Sasha is an expert. She’s a lovely person in every way and she’s so talented. Anetra has shown so much growth over the whole season and she’s also very talented. Something about her seems warm and genuine too.   >!what if Rupaul pulls another double crowning?!<
I agree 100%. Anetra is intriguing, we want so much to know her, her background, etc. From being a mormon, being kicked by her mother, coming from martial arts... she is giving consistent good inverviews, so to the tv show, MY OPINION is that she will create a bigger buzz and reach some new public.  I ALSO THINK Sasha's background very interesting, but we know more from her than from Anetra. Also, IN MY OPINION, for the tv show standpoint, there are other winners or fan favs that kind of relate to her "main" storyline (kylie, bosco, kerry...)  I ALSO THINK Sasha would be a great winner anyway. And I THINK none of them would come back to an all stars, unless their contract tells them to :-)
Agreed, I thought as much the first episode when she walked that fucking duck and Ru lost her shit.
> Also, when was the last time total wins counted for anything?        For real         Also, agree
some foreshadowing of anetra winning is ep1 when she said on a confessional that shes gonna walk that duck to the finale and get the crown. Then the rusical episode when ru did a walkthrough but only showed sasha and anetra walkthrough cuz theyre the top 2 in that episode just like now(hopefully) and they gave anetra the win.
It’s not an informed analysis, it’s a guess
Same. Not to mention from a branding/marketing angle, Anetra makes so much more sense as an All Stars contender.
All of this! Thank you I didn’t have the energy to write a written response to yet another one of these posts
This is an excellent response.
Naurrr bc for the longest time sasha didn't feel like she wasn't valid either(she talks abt in a interview), remember when Trans women weren't allowed on the show?? And when the whole narrative of drag race was abt only guys in wigs? Dark times for the show fr
Absolutely. I’ll be happy with a Sasha win as well. Although I would like Anetra to win just because I love her more, that doesn’t make Sasha any less deserving. Whether or not she wins, if people didn’t know that she was a star already, we ALL do now. I just don’t think that wins are a good predictor, and I think that as a show runner, it would be a satisfying storyline for Anetra to win.  My ideal fantasy is a double crowning though.
The show has changed a lot since 6. Not saying it’s impossible or even improbable. “The best” is not always the one who gets crowned, and that’s an inarguable fact.
True. Not saying she’s unworthy at all, far from it. This is just my hot take based on past seasons.
I won’t be mad but I’m just sayin 🤷
True, ultimately it *isn’t* up to me to decide lol. I should have made it clearer that this is a prediction I guess. You could also argue that it’s not a “who has been trying to get on Drag Race the longest” competition either.  But ultimately either result would be satisfying for their own reasons. Taking out political context, I still think Anetra would win. With political context, it’s Sasha’s. But we don’t know that it will actually be taken into account in the end. 🤷   I still want Anetra to win, but Sasha is deserving, and if she does win, it won’t and shouldn’t be because of *politics*, but because she’s motherfucking Sasha Colby.
I get that, but it just feels *too* predictable. Either way, it’s close and they are both deserving candidates.
I think the International Seasons play by different rules so to speak, but it will be well deserved if Sasha does end up winning. Still rooting for Anetra tho.
I did not have this context when making this post. The point wasn’t to hate on Sasha at all. Sasha, Anetra, MIB, and Luxx all have different, valid reasons for needing the crown. Sasha winning would be powerful, but I think it will most likely go to Anetra. That’s it.
I honestly think Anetra could’ve taken it in another season. Mistress too. (Luxx feels a little green but she’s got a lot left to show for All Stars.) Alas, S15 was the Sasha Colby meet & greet.  I love this cast. Amazing season.
We won’t know until we know. My desired outcome is a double crowning tbh.
That’s a valid criticism. Touché.
Definitely not an informed analysis. Maybe a statement of an opinion is more fitting. A "weak" opinion but an opinion nonetheless. And definitely not on why Anetra should win, but moreso on why Sasha should not win.
I’m just saying that wins aren’t always a reliable predictor, and that an underdog story is often more compelling. That said, and despite how much I want and think that Anetra will win, Sasha still deserves the world.
I meant informed as kind of tongue in cheek, but I guess I should have added an /s. Hindsight 2020.   You actually read my comments so I think you get it. Whatever the result, I think Sasha’s going to get so many good things coming her way, and it will all be deserved.
Well, it is not a scientific paper. It is implicit that OP is writing something from his/her perspective. He/she did not say this is an Universe rule of truth.   As u pointed that critique, could you make a full, impartial analysis for everybody, pls?
At this point? Neither can I.
I’m not really pressed, I know Sasha‘a winner material. I just think an Anetra win is probable.  I’ll happily take the L if Sasha wins lmao
I didn’t initially consider the political climate when making this post, but it makes me even more happy if Sasha does win. We predict an Anetra vs. Sasha because they are the two strongest competitors atm, but I agree in that seasons are made exponentially better WITHOUT Rigga Morris.   Ignoring political climate, I would like Anetra to win, but I can’t deny that it would be powerful for Sasha to win as well.
I’ve seen Anetra, you will not be disappointed, trust me.
>!A double crowning would be the blessed case scenario!!<
THANK YOU, THIS IS WHAT I’VE BEEN TRYING TO SAY THE WHOLE TIME!!!
That first ep got her the spot in the final four, provided she didn’t do anything to lose it (and she did not). But she also hasn’t really done the above and beyond since then to take the crown from Sasha either.  She will in All Stars though, when she’s ready
When she said “quack” I felt that.
Yes. I apologize for not using data analytics and citations.
If or if not? Babe. Sasha’s winning, just accept it now so you don’t take the anetra loss so hard. Plz lol   Also anetra is great, but to me, she is not at the level Sasha is in order to share a double crown. I truly believe anetra needs an all stars run, some more baking in the oven, become more fully realized and return and kill it.
And my point is that they have done a wealth of crowning types that there's absolutely no guarantee Anetra is winning. Sasha has equaling amounts of fan support per their social media pages and social media in general is very much obsessed with her.  Anetra is kinda likely... but Also Sasha can destroy Anetra.
Sasha did not audition until this season. She is the best competitor and is also charismatic enough and enough of a great performer to win with DR's formula.
Okay, but you understand that this entire sub being wall-to-wall comments like “she doesn’t need it” about someone who, by all rights, would’ve been cast a decade ago if Ru hadn’t considered gender-affirming surgery “performance enhancement,” might come off a little callous? And you don’t see the impact of crowning Sasha in the current US political climate?  Ask yourself which finalist you’d most like to see talking about drag bans on CNN and you’ll know who WOW will choose.
I think you are misconstruing my words. This is a prediction based on how most recent US seasons have gone, and from a potential show runner perspective. We have seen multiple US seasons where the win goes to the queen with 1 win vs. the obvious front runner. Based on this, I predict an Anetra win.  Sasha absolutely has the best track record, no argument there. Just because I said Anetra is going to win does not mean that I think Sasha doesn’t deserve to win. She does, objectively more than Anetra. But historically, that’s not always how it goes.
I’m here to tell you, by writing up what you wrote, it’s sounds pressed. I think this whole comment section would agree from the looks lol. And it’s not just you, I literally see Sasha Stan’s enjoying Sasha, confident cuz we know our girls gonna win, and then I see anetra Stan’s, literally spiraling making think pieces on how Sasha is not gonna win. Talking about Sasha all the time. It’s common now, and honestly, very funny 😂
U sureeee? 😂 if you say so hunn. Ok well…I’d say start pickin out if you want the upper case or lower case. 1 more week 🥰
I’m from vegas so I’m also an Anetra fan. Her talent show converted me. When I heard she was from vegas I didn’t have high expectations and then she taekwondoed any misconceptions I had about her! Hahaha
>!ok now I’m invested in this idea lmao. She has a large cast and saves the double elimination to make the finale a top 4 🤨 idk, anything can happen. She always has twists and gags on every season. She did it for All Stars!<
And soon I will ger downvoted too LOL Just want u to know me and probably more people get ur point
I still believe Anetra has a chance, but if I’m wrong I’m wrong, and I’m going to be happy for Sasha. No salt. It’s going to be a great lip sync.
I’m just saying an Anetra win is more likely than the fans seem to think. Especially because they are BOTH the fan favorites. Like, I think it’s 51% Anetra vs. 49% Sasha, not only based on queen performance, but also production shenanigans.  Look, whatever the result, I’m happy. either one would be a great winner.
Sasha winning would mean a lot to people, so I hope she wins too.   I’ll just be here sipping my Anetra Coping Juice until then 🧃
Granted, this was meant to be a fun theorizing discussion post, but I get it. Tensions are high with anti-trans legislation rampant, so it makes sense people are quick to react at any hint of transphobia (as it should be). Me saying that I think production will pick Anetra over Sasha wasn’t meant to belittle her.  Wasn’t really seeing all the other “she doesn’t need it” posts, the consensus that I have seen on the sub is that most think Sasha will win.   Regardless of who I personally want to win, Sasha totally deserves it, and her winning would be powerful. By all means, I will be happy if Sasha wins.  Also, agree with you that Ru’s “performance enhancement” thing was cringe.
To preface, I don't know if you genuinely used "informed analysis" based on actual facts and observations or just to say your prediction/opinion. If it is the latter, then this comment is a moot point and should be ignored. But if it is the former, please bear with my opinion below.   > Sasha absolutely has the best track record, no argument there. Just because I said Anetra is going to win does not mean that I think Sasha doesn’t deserve to win.   To start, I am not arguing with your statement above so we can ignore that. If you are going to analyse something and present an informed conclusion, I believe using SWOT (even though somewhat outdated) or any other tool should be the minimum. What you presented in your original post only stated the threat on why Anetra couldn't win - which was Sasha. You could've listed her strengths and the external climate on why she should win.    Another point is that you began your argument with >Sasha doesn't need a crown to prove herself.   In no sense this statement is a valid argument on why Anetra should win and you also just presented the underdog storyline as to why she should. Sasha was also mentioned more times than Anetra in your post, that is why I said my comment   >A "weak" opinion but an opinion nonetheless. And definitely not on why Anetra should win, but moreso on why Sasha should not win.   If you have included your comment below on the original post, I think it would be a much stronger argument. >This is a prediction based on how most recent US seasons have gone, and from a potential show runner perspective. We have seen multiple US seasons where the win goes to the queen with 1 win vs. the obvious front runner. Based on this, I predict an Anetra win.   And I, thank you.
I guess, I just know that much of the backlash on here is also because of what’s happening with anti-trans legislation right now, and maybe people think I’m saying Sasha won’t win because of that? Which was absolutely not the intent, and I want to make that clear to everyone. The anger is justified, but should be redirected.  If that makes me sound pressed idc. No diss to Sasha, she’s a legend.
Uppercase because I like ‘em big.
>!Too bad they didn't film a double crowning like they did in s6!<
Thank you fam, I get that part of it is a response to fear and hate, so I can’t be mad, but it’s exhausting lol
I appreciate the essay lol. The certainty of the title was meant to be tongue in cheek. I still predict an Anetra win, but yeah it’s a prediction. If this were a true analysis I’d cite my sources like a college paper lmao.   I think the storyline would be satisfying within the frame of the season, and only the season. When we bring real world context, then the fact that rpdr is airing at all is a miracle. In that sense, Sasha winning is justice, but it is inconsequential to those who would seek to destroy us. I hope things will get better soon.
>!:(!<
😩😭
This is whitewashing.
Anetra and Sasha are really light no? And you made Kelly and Michelle white.
Just one quick observation other than skin tone: you've made Mistress way thinner than she actually is by giving her the same height and head size as the other girls. Flatten her figure a little bit and increase her head size, it'll look much better
Why are they so light skinned tho when none of the queens are Caucasian
Why did you lighten everyone's skintone?
Whitewashed.
Why is Sasha white and Mistress thin 🤐
mistress is a skinny legend lmao
Kawaii! Love it.  Would make Anetra’s and Sasha’s skin tone a bit darker tho. They are really light.
Not someone downvoting all the positive comments 😭😭😭 The art is very cute, but Anetra and Sasha are tan (Anetra is mixed while Sasha is native hawaiian to be more specific) so you gotta make them more tan in the art
damn i thought she ate till i read the comments 💀💀
I loveeee. Um, this is an anime I would tune in for every week.  ![gif](giphy|chnjVG5gXHNFWIe4SE)
This is so cute!!!
Would be a cute t shirt
Wait these are amaaaazing! So cool. If these were t-shirts sold by the queens they’d 100% sellout IMO
I love how creative and engaged this sub is. Reddit can be full of doom scrolling depressing articles. But never here. I always find something to smile at in this sub :)
Omg this is stunning it looks so cute
Fabulous! I love how you included the puppets too
Beautiful. Love the style
Love love looove these!
Gorgeous - and also, damn good taste on which outfits you chose. :)
As a POC lemme just say whitewashing holds a context that implies malicious intent. Some artists are not great at skin tones and that’s okay. This is fanart, meant to be fun and light hearted, not a political statement.   It’s also okay to critique art when posted on a public forum. I just don’t want us to crucify someone for something intended to be harmless.   Nice job OP, this is cute, and the girls would look even cuter with some more skin tone matching :)
Omg I never thought I’d see a drag race beat saber crossover. I love this game so much I’ll have to check this out!
Yaaaaassss
YES!!!!! I’ve been getting into VR Fitness lately & I love Beat Saber as a little warmup!    There is far too little queer music on there.
There’s a few Rupaul songs on BeatSaver, like Sissy That Walk & Glamazon!   Some are a bit too advanced for me right now, but I’m working my way up to more difficult maps.
YAAASSSSSS! Please try it out!
I agree! I was tired of waiting and just did one myself!
What other VR games do you do for fitness? I'm doing the same thing but only with Beat Saber
I tried your map & it’s pretty fun!  I’m a newbie on BeatSaber, just worked my way up to Hard so I’m not quite up to Expert level on most songs.    But I did like the parts where you like have a extended long arch thing.  I haven’t seen that in a map before!
Thrill of the Fight, Body Combat, Audio Trip.    Also Pistol Whip is one of my faves.  You need to change the settings though, to Bulletproof AND Vengeance.  This causes you to  have to dodge & squat constantly.  You’ll end up doing SO MANY squats, but in a very fun way.    I do everything while wearing a weighted vest.  Don’t use ankle or wrist weights.
Oh my bad, I definitely should have stayed the difficulty level! Glad you tried though! That arch was like waving hello, little cheesy but easily my favorite part :)
Sweet! Thanks for the advice.
She's just acting like Anna Wintour. Forever unimpressed.
Carson’s reaction: When you are at the bus stop, but the bus drives right past you.
Alaska isn’t there? Do you mean Anna Wintour?
She was playing Anna Wintour. She was in character.
Girl get some glasses, that's clearly Anna Wintour
god i remember watching this for the first time…not yet knowing anything past S7 at all…and wondering who that long woman was
Alaska is a fantastic actress. You would know that if you saw her in the hit film Sharknado 6.
After all the 2 in 1s we've seen, Violet was right. It IS a talent
This was so iconic they made this a Runway on Germany’s Next Topmodel
I wonder if it was completely silent when the queens where walking, like no background music such as in this video…
This is a good reveal but honestly, I never lived for what she revealed into  It's like one of those skydiving suits  It's like flying squirrel realness
*intentionally funny
This has been one of my favorite looks for years
I knew from this moment Violet was going to be final 3.
Wake up, Anna… wake up!!
This was a moment where you could say “yeah she’s gonna make it to the finals”
Showing two looks in one is a talent
Lol what if she recognized Violet and remembered she was the one that allegedly stole her ex’s crown
Random but I will always say that this episode should have been a double win between Violet and Miss Fame
Am I the only one who didn't like the hat for this outfit? Always seemed a bit out of place for both looks, like aesthetically.
I really didn’t see much “wow” from this ngl.
Fun fact: the girls walked the runway twice and this was Violet’s second take, so everyone here is acting because they knew the reveal was coming. I remember this because of an interview where Violet complained that on her first take one of the wings didn’t open fully when she spun (which is why you see her manually pull them loose in this clip).
Poker face… no, seriously, poke her face!
* insert tammie brown “i’m acting” .gif * (side note why is that gif literally impossible to find in the gif search)
GOD this comment has fucking sent me to the bus stop and then drove past me (it’s very accurate lmaooo)
Or when you’re in the bus and you drive past the bus stop and see Roxxxy Andrews laying there
A method actress
honestly I know it was *really* early on in the season at this point but I saw her talent here and I said 👀 she wins the season lmaooo
Most good reveals aren’t about the clothes. They’re about how well you can pull off the reveal. Note: Brooke Lynn Hytes pulling off an Afro and a poncho to reveal a bathing suit. None of those clothes were particularly impressive or interesting, but the transition was SMOOTH.
I think it was just how smooth the reveal was, how it looked so fierce on the runway and Carson’s reaction. You’re right, it looks like a skydiving suit but the way the fabric moves dials it up a notch.
i agree, but keep in mind this was before reveals were in every other runway and lip synch. seeing this for the first time without comparing it to future seasons will always be iconic  i genuinely wasn’t expecting it, and at this point i can’t say the same for most of the reveals that came after
oh but when it was back in 2015 everyone and their mothers lived for this, but now that we all love to hate on violet we actually don't like it that much?
The thing is is that you can already tell it’s gonna be a reveal when you see the hat, gloves, and boots if that didn’t already give it away. Violet still absolutely sells it like she’s at Fashion Week, and it’s still a slay.
Poker? I hardly know her!
Are you ok, Roxxy?
we’re past the bus stop jokes babes move on
Daniel day Lewis is shaking
Your flair has me snort-laughing. Love it.
If I ever started to get mad at Violet, I would think back on this moment and simmer down.
I SAID I FELT
Mmmm… I love that drink
Welcome to another home fried male!
I have my new book. It’s called Jessica Wild…The dreams…of a golden…shower
Matt Berry.  Someone in this subreddit said the actors from that show are big fans of RPDR, and I would LOVE to hear his critiques in that glorious voice of his.
Rina Sawayama. I love her sm anf I want a Comme Des Garçons lip sync so bad 😩
Sandra Bernhard, Maya Rudolph, Sarah Silverman, Tina Fey, Wanda Sykes, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Phoebe Waller Bridge
jennifer coolidge and paul rudd
Carly Rae Jepsen, obviously
John Oliver, hands down
Dan Levy
Kylie Minogue, Kim Petras, Pedro Pascal, Daniel Radcliffe, Kevin Bacon, Sarah Silverman
Christian Siriano for a design challenge would be incredible  Richard Ayoade   Jennifer Coolidge   Jenny Slate  And also agreeing many others here, Pedro Pascal
Marina for DRUK
Daniel Radcliffe, Tim Gunn, any and all of the queer eye hosts
More straight men and athletes, TBH. I can never remember their names but their were two baseball players in the earlier seasons (season 3?), I loved Joel McHale bc he was unhinged, and Jeff Goldblum was killer.
Zaddy Pedro for sure. He would have a great time and so would I.
Niecey Nash-Betts!
The Gregarious Diana Ross ~~Matthews~~
Every queen with a crown.  WoW should start treat them as celebrities.

Megan Thee Stallion, I think she'd fit there more than she did on Legendary
Björk!
Cupcakke. I need a lip sync with her as a guest
Oh my god, can they get Lisa Anne Warren and Elaine Hendricks at the same time??  Also, we need Alan Cumming on to judge a Romy and Michele's High School Reunion parody. Seriously, how have they not done one.
Caroline Polachek, with So Hot You're Hurting My Feelings as the lip sync song
Jane Lynch, Jamie Lee Curtis and Jennifer Coolidge.
*Nicole      Paige                                                  Brooks*
I need 2 guest judges back instead of one. Such a great opportunity to bring out some lesser known queer icons
A Drag Race/Housewives crossover has already happened. Garcelle already was a guest judge on All Stars 3, and we've had Rinna and Camille from RHOBH as guest judges in the past (season 2 and season 5 respectively) + Kandi Burruss from RHOA guest judged on season 11. Rinna and Garcelle's appearances were pre-RH, though.
Literally myself! Hahahaha I would DO ANYTHING to judge one day 😂
ETHEL CAIN
Garcelle has been a guest judge.
Sarah Michelle Gellar (for anything)   Jamie Lee Curtis and Heather Langenkamp ( horror challenge)   Lindsay Lohan (anything)   Paris Hilton (marketing challenge)   Erin Cahill (Christmas movie challenge)   Andrea Barber and Jodie Sweetin (sitcom)   Tracee Ellis Ross (anything)   Weird Al (parodies)   Ninja Sex Party/Game Grumps (silly music challenge)    But now that I think about it, I'd love a NSP lip sync. I Own a Car would be great.
Since Dixie Carter is a dear departed, I want the rest of the Designing Women. Bring on Annie Potts, Delta Burke AND ESPECIALLY JEAN SMART PLEASE.
Iggy Azalea (with a I am the stripclub lipsync)   Rina Sawayama    Lana Del Rey    Jennifer Coolidge   Jamie Lee Curtis
I want harry styles so bad. He would never, but I want it.
I know I've already made a comment, but I also want to say Rebecca Black.   I just really really want a Friday lip sync.
the show was basically a parody of ANTM in the early days so tyra banks feels like a no brainer. elizabeth berkley, showgirls icon. dave bautista, reps the wrestling community which has a lot of fan crossover and his mom is queer. fran drescher, brandy, parker posey, debi mazar, kim cattrall, missy elliott.  edited to add: i miss when they’d have two unaffiliated guest judges on the same episode. it was fun to see some random pairings, like john waters and demi lovato or aubrey o’day and joan van ark
Harvey Guillen said that in Untucked
I need Julia Louis-Dreyfus for the next political challenge they do, Selina Meyer judging a political comedy challenge would be amazing
how didn't we get him before? It is crazy.
Christian Siriano would be a really good pick, I can see him being on the judges' panel if Ru ever retires, he knows the stress of the competition and coming out on top, I think he might have great advice for the girls, especially in the workroom discussions.
Also I think it would be a miracle if it happened but Celine Dion would be amazing
>Nicole      Paige                                                  Brooks  Tim Gun!! He is a queer icon and I'm pretty sure he has crossed paths with Ru and his team before and it's so strange we didn't see him yet
Basketball players. Rick Fox (I only remember because he dated Eliza Dushku lol) and John Sally. Season 4 because Willam and Latrice were defo there.  Edit to add: OMG I loved Joel McHale. He floods my basement.
S2E4 - The OG Snatch Game had her as a guest judge.
That's one thing I enjoy about the international seasons, since many of them feature queens from other franchises, not necessarily crowned ones. The contestants really seem to enjoy it as well! (No feigning excitement over a "celebrity" they do not recognize.)
Also I've seen Daniel Radcliffe a few times in the comments.. also YES
>Also I think it would be a miracle if it happened but Celine Dion would be amazing  I was gonna say Ziwe too and I forgot, but I think Rupaul might be a little too old to understand her humor though, but If they ever replace the judges' panel, I can see her as either a replacement for either Michelle or Ross, she exudes confidence and her interactions with her guests on her show seems so natural.
YES
I would love to see that but if we ever see her come I think it would be just like Tove Lo or Normani they're gonna make them sit there and play an '80s song that anyone barely remembers...
>Megan Thee Stallion, I think she'd fit there more than she did on Legendary  Me too! They need to add an extra meter to the panel and get 2 guest judges lol, especially if the guest judges have a pre-existing relationship it makes the deliberations so funny. But looking at the old judges panel photos, they seem too uncomfortably tight sitting there lol
I had no idea that Garcelle and Camille was on it though it is so interesting
oh I had no idea
>Jamie Lee Curtis and Heather Langenkamp ( horror challenge)  I'm manifesting a double premier with Paris and Lindsay on season 16, 3rd challenge is a horror-comedy with Jamie Lee and Sarah Michelle
I think it was one of the most obvious choices for the political challenge, I thought we were gonna see her in S12 but oh well we can hope for season 16
Yes Rick Fox! Good Lord he's hot. I love how these men are not gay icons, super straight, and they all totally revelled and were involved in the judging and had their minds blown.
Omg how do I not remember that!! Thank you!
You're so right 😭😭😭
I wonder how much that wig weighs.
LOVE this outfit she’s wearing.
A BIG GIRL?   WHERE?
MIB must have neck muscles of steel, omfg that wig looks so heavy
Bitch! That wig!
mother
Mpathy Is Beautiful (MIB)
i lub this bitch
She’s so badass. 🥰
Love this venue!
Omg love her little kitten heel booties. Protect your onkle gurl. We need more OCPA (Onkle Cleek Prevention Awareness)
She looks soooooo good + that lil moment gave me a good chuckle!
That wig is STUNNING 🤩
I was at this show!! She did sooo good.
Check the shoes
Her breast plates on backwards
I thought it was Eureka circa 2010.
A big girl? Where?
![gif](giphy|3og0IxVnlVlHkRUji8|downsized)
Right? Momma is just getting  closer to Jesus! 😂
my first thought immediately! that wig is HUGE
More then the twink in the back lol
I was going to say a joke about that wig weighing more than half the queens of s15 but this fandom sometimes takes certain things to heart!
omg seriously  it's so gorgeous though
Same. She looks like a million bucks.
There’s no music in this clip?
That color plus the studded tights?! YES MAM!
Omg my phone was glitching and playing some weird song over it lol
She was definitely in her bag for this lipsync I think she said after this lipsync was when she really knew she had a chance at winning the competition because she proved she could do everything the judges (Ru) were looking for
For being such a weirdo, Willow is surprisingly sensual.
That wig on her makes me drool.
Bosco's more overt sexiness in this doesn't really go with the song so much as Willow's more seductive approach. Some of Willow's energy is directed inward at summoning her sensuality. Bosco just blasts everything out in a way that doesn't jibe with the song.  Both are good lipsyncers. Willow just understood the assignment, including by having a look that could work with more of the songs.  I'm very curious how Bosco will fare on an All Stars. As for Willow on an All Winners, that's a major unknown.
I know this is about Willow, but I love it when Ru sings along to a lip sync. I love seeing everyone vibe and have a good time.
She embodied the song perfectly. My eyes were on her the whole time
nevertoomuchnevertoomuchnevertoomuch
i actually rewatch this lipsync all the time. it was iconic for me 🥲
I loveeee the dress Willow has on
when she says Like Im The Only Bitch In The Room  in her confessional —— that plays in my mind all day
God I love Willow. Watching the season for the second time I really notice how much she dominated from the start.
This lip sync made me fall in love with this song. Like I've always enjoyed it casually but now I get actively excited when it comes on.
My favourite lipsync performance from season 14. It's just so refined and Willow looks mesmerizing
Might be unpopular but this was the best lip sync of season 14
oh I think about it all the time, probably one of my favorite moments from any of the winners ever
That season was so freaking good
That’s one of those songs I would never have thought would make a good lip sync song, but I loved both of them doing it.
I'm pretty sure it was this moment that made me fall for willow deeply. She touched my heart with her story but her passions and charisma really shined through on the stage here. Diva doing queen things 👑
Willow demolished this! I thought I was going crazy loving it so much, everyone I spoke to said it was boring because she wasn't moving much but she had so much sensual energy here
It’s a masterpiece
Those side shuffle/guitar strums and head bops live rent free in my mind forever!
Quick stop to say I love Ru on her black lipstick era. Work
That’s when I knew she was going to win.
Never too much, never too much, never too much🎶
If she’s still healthy enough to do 10-12 hours of taping, I wanna see Willow do an All Winners
I was like salivating when I saw this lip sync the first time. Willow was so fucking sexy in that wig and dress. This look, besides being sexy, was legendary.
Her understated, confident sensuality here was absolutely perfect for this song.
Lives rent free in my head, along with Carmen Farala in the España season 1 finale.
My fav lip sync song ever!
my favorite lip sync ever
Season 14 was such a moment omg
I AM a lesbian
Obsessed with how this dress fits her
Fry the eggs, hold the wine!
This was one of many songs I always hoped would be on Drag Race but never never thought it actually would be. I was not disappointed! Both were so fun to watch!
i love her hair in this
These women are having a mid-off
Uhhh….I mean it’s a pretty mid lipsync. She looks good though.
Yes, it was the surprise factor for me.  I never expected Willow to ace this type of sultry sensual performance.
One of my favourite bits in whatcha packing is when Michelle says to Willow something like ‘I don’t think you realise how sexy you are’ and Willow says: ‘Oh, no I know I’m sexy’  Willow is sexy af and knows it!
Is this the sexiest a queen has ever looked on the show? Maybe
and ru looks so good here too, the dark lipstick is *chef’s kiss*
My favorite thing about latrice vs Monique and coco vs Monica was the judges vibing along
🤣🥂
It’s my favorite solo lip sync of the whole season, by far. Idk if it’s technically the best, but for me, she serves the hardest.
Same. I really just can't explain how Willow's performance affects me.
Same
Same!
That's fair! I definitely won't contest that thought.
I mean the Jorgeous/Orion and Bosco/Lady Camden were good too but idk was this considered a lip sync season cause I can’t recall any others that were… umm… good?
I fell for her in the talent show but this lip sync is when I was like yep she’s my queen to win it all
Idk what Bosco is doing tbh but Willow was giving auntie vibes
You speak facts.
*Am I a lesbian?*
This is definitely up there but things like the straight up lipsync probably top it
We Stan
Am I a heterosexual?
Which one was that again?
Carmen Carrera Vs Raja, it's where the Alexis Mateo confessional "this is just soft porn... it's kind of hot" comes from
NYC has some of the best drag in the world so don’t sleep on the local gals. RuGirls pop in every now and then (look up 3 Dollar Bill, although in BK they host a lot of em) but Hell’s Kitchen and the West Village will be your go to. Just look up gay bars in those areas and check their events on IG or the bar’s website.
You’re actually very likely to just run into a Ru girl at any drag show! Possibly out of drag. Keep an eye on 3DB, Paragon or Hush. Playhouse, Pieces or Hardware (out of drag Ru girls). If you see Shequidah Hall on Thursday at hardware you’re definitely likely to see someone.
For a guaranteed Ru Girl Shuga Cain always hosts a drag brunch at Macy’s on Sunday’s, every week is a [different theme](https://www.flipphoneevents.com/newyork).  If you’re up to traveling to Astoria in Queens there are some great local queens here. Icon is closest to me which is Jax’s hometown bar so I’ve seen her there a few times and Jan pops in sometimes as well. But their local queens Petti Cash on Fridays & Catrina Lovelace on Saturdays are great. They have drag shows other nights of the week too but I’m old and can only do non-work nights. Albatross is another bar here that has great local Queens   Also in Astoria is Fresco’s Grand Cantina which has a great drag brunch on Sunday’s at 12 & 3.
and you can check thotyssey.com as well!
Look up Frankie Sharp on Instagram. He regularly books Ru girls. Pieces bar on Mondays is usually full of Ru girls out or drag, Shequida Hall and Janelle no 5 host and they’re incredible. Thorgy does a viewing party every week in BK. The house of Muse hosts a bi-weekly/monthly party at HUSH and I’ve met tons of Ru girls there.
You’ll probably need to book 3DB shows in advance but others you won’t have to. Just bring money for tips and you’ll be good!
Confirmed. I saw Dahlia Sin out of drag taking in Alaska’s show at 3DB last year.
Very cool, thanks for the tips on specific bars! :)
Thank you so much! :) Drag brunches actually sound like so much fun!
Seconding Shuga’s Drag Brunch which is super fun. If you’re going to be here next Sunday she’s doing a Sister Act-themed one that also doubles as a fundraiser!
Just this advice alone pointed me towards Pangina being at 3 Dollar Bill! I am fangirling already :D Thank you so much for your advice :)
Have fun!!
Real question. I wonder how much the social media engagement on posts like that factor in (if at all) to the winner choice.
My favourite part about her being at the top of the Twitter and Instagram polls is that she basically has the social media presence of someone with a flip phone 😭 Iconic
That’s amazing!  So excited for this finale.
Anetra vs Sasha Rivalry may be the most respectful one to date but boy oh boy you know they both want it.  Finale lip sync will be the stuff of legends. #Allornothingnow
So wild that Sasha absolutely slayed and yet anetra has a real shot at the crown. Strong season
I have not been this excited for a finale in a long time. The gay gasp will be heard around the world if they pull another S9 and Sasha does not win
The CHOP and The LEAP were the 2 most exciting moments of drag race since Yvie vs Brooke after S11 Snatchgame.  Edit: But stan Sasha and MIB too ( don’t @ me Luxx!)
Anetra won me over when she broke those boards covering my heart.  From that moment forward, I was #TeamAnetra .
I can't remember a previous finale where I didn't have a strong, strong opinion on which queen should win. I'd be pretty happy with any of them at this point.
It's what she deserves :>
![gif](giphy|jlylJkp7RmdnW)
I’m kind of shocked! Based on this sub and others I would’ve thought Sasha would have more by a mile! So glad Anetra’s got a real shot at the crown! #TeamAnetra
I absolutely love this for her. She's a star.
I love that photo.  She is so hot.
I'm #TeamAnetra for life because (*nasal voice*) **sHE REAlly IS tHAt gEWRL**, but weirdly enough I only really want Sasha to take the S15 crown because it just feels... *correct*: mother IS a winner, and she doesn't need a second run on Drag Race to confirm that.  Anetra is a powerhouse drag queen and an all-around iconic bitch, but I'm sure she can grow even more. The prospect of her having another round on All Stars (and destroying everything in her way like we all know she can do) would make me the happiest man alive, and I'm 100% convinced that it would be the best thing that could happen to her career in the long run.
Feels correct
i want her to win so bad
I LOVE THIS QUEEN
I just love her and I'm so thrilled she's made such an impression with this many people. She manages to be a super star while being incredibly humble; she's warm and personable without having to hog a spotlight. I never got the vibe that she was playing a character version of herself for the cameras. She's clever, she's funny, and she genuinely seems like a *nice* human being.   There's a reason so many of my favorite moments from season 15 were with Anetra.
Duck walk to the crown
I didn't see her coming the first episode.  And as the season has progressed I have just....loved her and become a huge fan.
Some of y'all don't even know (or remember) the difference between Katya's an Alaska's #Team photos and posts on Twitter and Instagram.   It was insane.
i already know the finale top 2 lipsync is gonna be legendary, i mean we got a glimpse of it during the Lalaparuza
This promo is 🔥🔥🔥. She’s so hot. She could step on my neck by accident and I’d thank her.
She's the people's queen
\#TeamAnetra  All the finalists are awesome - I just like what I like, that's all :)
Go Anetra!!!!! 💖💖💖💖💖
So we have reunion this week and finale next week? Or this week is just a filler week?
Is she ok? She’s been canceling all her shows.
Feels correct
If a double crowning happens, I'll be doubling up my charity tip this month. Just throwing it out to the universe 🙏🏽 😭
Blablabla people are not using Instagram anymore blablabla TikTok... when it's right it's right 💫
That's nice or whateva but...  ![gif](giphy|zfhavrMEL7ViY5XXHC|downsized)
Too bad this isn’t RuPaul’s audience popularity contest race
I actually worry about Anetra if she did win. I’m worried about the toxic fans who will constantly discredit her or the drag queens/colleagues/peers (to a lesser extent) who have voiced their opinion and are enthralled by Sasha. Just imagine all of the doubt and excuses that’ll be thrown her way if she won.   You can say, it won’t matter bc she’ll be crowned and w 200k in her pocket BUT listen to the last episode of squirrel friends. Trixie admitted herself she wish she didn’t win the way she did. So it’s only natural that it can affect her.   Sasha winning the crown (in my opinion, rightfully so for several obvious reasons) won’t be questioned by anyone, not even the ones bored w her or rooting for an underdog.   Anetra winning on the other hand, will cause some chatter.   Just pointing out a possibility that may be worth considering.
The best outcome to me right now feels as though Sasha needs to win this season and Anetra needs to win an All Stars.  Anetra has been great this season and deserves to win no doubt, however, to me Sasha this season has felt very similar to how queens who return for All Stars usually are. Elevated not only in talents but also looks.
8 days? It’s not 2moro 😭?
Can we just get a real double crowning this season? Please?
This is gonna be a 3 inch acrylic nail biter. I honestly cannot choose between Anetra and Sasha.
Let me go like it now!
YES! This is CORRECT!
just remember, sasha went to LA year 2014 to start her rpdr journey (although) she did not auditioned she received a lot of negative feedback from production itself saying they won't let her win.   if ever sasha wins, this is a win for all us 🥰
I would be happy with either Anetra or a Sasha win (though my heart is with Anetra*). So excited to have tickets to see Anetra performing in Glasgow in May.    *My vagina is with Sasha. And with Anetra in drag. And kinda with Anetra out of drag.
You better walk that fucking ~~butterfly~~
She's wonderful! I very much enjoy her
Aw man I just realised her lipstick isn't even, in the cupids bow 🙃
Team Sasha here but much respect to Anetra.
Everytime I see that photo now all I can see is how weird the top lip looks 😂
I imagine Anetra will be kept for All Stars, where she'd have more finances to bring a really heightened runway package. She's done really well but they've made a point in the edit about her needing to come out of her shell more etc. Love a lot of what she's done and wouldn't be mad if she won, but I'm going off what the show has been signposting.  Crowning Sasha now makes the most sense from the show's perspective even. Her runways have been immaculate and she's performed amazingly in most of the challenges, in addition to having a huge level of public support. The stars have all aligned and not crowning her would feel pretty anti-climactic at this point.  My opinions based on the edits, etc, of course.
Anetra owes 25% of her success to a certain shiny red bulge. 🍒
I love Sasha, but I want Anetra to win!
QUEEN
As it should be.
I really hope she wins 🦆
I’m happy with either winning although I would love Anetra to win more
You know this finale is going to be good because neither Anetra or Sasha need stunts and reveals to put on a show. We all know the top 2 lip sync will obviously be these two.
i know it’s petty but the lopsided top lip in this photo be driving me crazy
The season has REALLY pushed and highlighted Anetra a lot in the last few episodes to cement her as a worthy competitor to Sasha. I'm personally a much bigger fan of Sasha and Mistress (in that order) - I just think they're more interesting as queens, aesthetically and personality-wise. Anetra is a KILLER performer, and tbh that could easily get her the win if she does incredibly in the lip syncs. I'm just over the duck-walking and similar moves every time... I don't really understand the massive popularity, but I respect her a performer and queen. I just personally think Sasha or Mistress should win - it's been SO LONG since we've had a seasoned veteran queen win, and Sasha has massacred this competition consistently (unlike Anetra who had a GREAT start and good end - yes, she did well at the end, but not as incredibly as the editing/judging wants us to believe)
I’m rooting for Anetra but understand why it should go to Sasha
What was the previous most ever?
She deserves to win!
Double crowning?
Dang! That really is crazy! They rarely crack 200k. Maybe she just might win.
I want a tie win this season
Double crown them
She's my third choice but I know I'm in the minority lol
Divina, Bimini and Ella were all top liked in UK
Anetra vs Sasha winning is giving very Danny beard and Cheddar Gorgeous vibes. Both are amazing and it should be a double crowning .
I would love to see Sasha compete against a higher caliber of queens in an All Stars season. It really could be a toss-up between her and Anetra.
As if those actually matter. I love Anetra but I recall when everyone thought Pearl was going to win over Violet due to the fan pole.
It's what she deserves.
 Maybe Anetra wins this and Sasha goes on to win AS.  Then Sasha could go up against all the other AS winners in an all winners AS.
I’m going to flip tables over if Anetra doesn’t win. FLIPPING. TABLES.
Love her but NOOOOO
Sasha deserves the crown period bffr
Nice to know that drag race fans have an objective lack of taste I guess
Sasha studied hard at the school of drag race but Anetra has shown the most growth and connects with viewers.  Sasha is a RPDR robot and I'm bored with it.
I’m gonna hate idc I straight up don’t get it.
I'm so perplexed.
Wow
Worst queen to ever be on the show.
mother
I’m still holding out hope that Sasha gets the crown lol
Aja disagree xD
Lets Go Sasha!
Demand is INSANE
YASSSSS! #teamAnetra
I bet it factors in at least a little bit. I don't think they'd give a crown to someone who was number 3rd in the voting.
As rupaul says “I’ve seen the social media, consulted with the judges, but the final decision is mine to make”
WELL TAMAR…
Not much- Katya on AS2 or Divina on UKS1
I think it unfortunately can have a negative effect on the winner choice. If producers see this much support for her, they might keep her for all-stars because she has such a clear built-in fan base, especially given how much support Sasha has behind her as well to more than justify a win people would be happy with.  I'm rooting for Anetra!
I remember that for AS7, Jinkx had the most liked top 4 social post by a landslide. There's obviously no denying that RuPaul loved Jinkx's performance on that season, but I think they could've easily gone for Monét if the fan response to Jinkx wasn't as strong as it ended up being.  On the other hand, the UK franchise has been notorious for choosing the queen with the least finale social post engagement to win, so I think that those mainly serve as risk assessment and only impacts the final decision if the viewers' preference for one queen is undeniable.
Honestly, I'm convinced the only reason they didn't crown Jada on CDR3 was because she got the least fan support of the whole top 4 by a pretty significant margin.
None realistically. They pick the winner before the season even airs.
I think it's probably a mix of that (and other forms of fan approval) and what they've already planned for the season
really shows that the amount of effort you put into social media is not linear to the outcome whatsoever. at this point anetra has like 50 fans running social media accounts that keep her relevant every week without her needing to do anything 💀
They do not have a rivalry.
...because it's not a "rivalry" lmao
Is it really *that* wild, it’s pretty common for an obvious winner to not be the fan favorite to win. Adore, Kim Chi, Gotmik all went into the finale with the majority of fan support despite the winners having some of the strongest season runs we have ever seen.    Plus out of the 6 previous season (9-14) the winner had the most wins/best track record only twice.    No matter what I’m expecting this finale to be one of the bests since S9.
I appreciate your enthusiastic outlook, but Sasha has this thing on lock.
Oooh yes, it would be really surprising if the one with the best TR not end up with the crown! That's never happened before.
I love my girl Anetra and I want her to win, but she objectively has no real shot at the crown. This season is so obviously Sasha’s
But Sasha did win S9 (jk)
![gif](giphy|darj2i0ydEarFSl8Nc|downsized)
And the dress also. I kept saying how she had the 3 iconic drag race moments of the season
The way my queer little heart fluttered when she [CHOP]-YES'd...
omg same
Same here! I knew she’d be in the top with that performance!
I honestly think these fan likes don’t factor in much at all. It’s pretty usual for Ru to crown whoever she thinks represents where the brand needs to go regardless of the social media engagement factor.
There's a lot of lurkers in this sub, and I guess many DR fans are not even on Reddit... that could explain it?
I think Anetra showed a little bit more of charisma than Sasha. I connected more with her through out the season.
"Am I a lesbian?"
Sasha is not even my fave this season but I'd be devastated to see her lose lol
Anetra is my favorite queen this season but Sasha deserves the win. Sasha effortlessly slayed as a consummate professional and i was gagged every time.   Anetra can cook a little more to come back to win All Stars 🤩
you didn't she her first episode? where you sick
I mean it was twenty years ago
I’m team Anetra all the way.
Really? ALL of them?
Well Bianca is #teamAnetra so that's validation enough for me. But yeah, I get what you're saying, it must feel shitty for almost all the alumni to root for someone else and I do fear the toxic ones too. Having 30K more likes than Sasha's post + the most voted post in DR's herstory tho? That's a feat on its own.
I agree 100%. I respect and am a huge fan of Sasha, but I haven't been as enchanted with a queen in a while as I have been with Anetra. Anetra would absolutely face tremendous backlash not only from parts of the fanbase but other queens, though perhaps quietly on the second part.  I doubt Anetra would even need to come back to All Stars to cement her place in the franchise. I hope she gets to display her talents in other venues, as I think she will shine even more brightly in a less cutthroat environment.
Reunion is tomorrow 😂😭
Wait what??? Omg source?
I can see the heads!!
YES!
I’m feeling a bit isolated in this thread repping \#teammistress - this isn’t just a two horse race! Well, realistically it’s a one horse race, but the others are unlucky as any other season they’d all have real shot. :)
notttt this comparison. NOT.  LOOOOOL
Yeah thinking back it was basically Sasha vs. queens who have been doing drag for less than 3 years lol
All Winners 🥹 I think Anetra will be great for all stars
Blind much?
uh, no? sasha doing all stars will be an AS5 situation, which is, not good. sasha is a now or never situation. anetra is the one that needs that all stars glow up
What’s the point of having the first round of the finale if it’s just a popularity contest?
I respect that you qualified your statement w it’s your opinion and it might be unpopular. In my opinion I think everything matters, including every phase of the finale.   I think what isn’t debatable is that everyone’s opinion on what should and shouldn’t matter fits our own personal narrative of who we want to see win. There’s nothing wrong with that. We can differ in opinion. At the end of the day Ru and production decides.   I still stand by what I said earlier though, in my opinion Anetra will face some scrutiny if she wins. As someone who can’t wait to see a vegas girl do great things in the future, I worry for her if she’s crowned.
Your own objective lack of taste is showing lol
Am I out of touch? No, it’s the children that are wrong!
Sasha has been honing her craft since before Drag Race aired. Anetra is the one who came into drag through this show. You can root for whoever you want for the finale and Anetra is a fabulous queen, but the discounting of 20 years as a drag performer is tired.
![gif](giphy|4PJtbPPH3OpEJR6BYm)
I love Anetra, but how dare you call Sasha a robot. Besides her obvious talent, she has shown kindness, graciousness, and humor this entire season.  I agree that Anetra has connected more with viewers, including myself, but that is because production was too lazy to properly develop a narrative for Sasha's journey on drag race.
Someone drags Anetra - downvotes. You drag Sasha - downvotes. People really can't win on this subreddit lmao.  Personally I love Sasha and Mistress and believe they're so much more interesting in terms of personality, aesthetic, charisma and start power. Anetra is cool but apart from performing the same duck walk and tricks, idk.... I prefer the other top 4 members.
Absolutely agree with you. She's just not as interesting and lovable to me compared to Sasha and Mistress. The performance skills? Giving! But I'm sick of the duck walk and same style each time. The charisma/personality/star power - I see it more in Mistress and Sasha.
Totally agree with you. Don't let the sub silence you lol.  She's just not as interesting and lovable to me compared to Sasha and Mistress. The performance skills? Giving! But I'm sick of the duck walk and same style each time. The charisma/personality/star power - I see it more in Mistress and Sasha.
Ok Santino
Well number 3 in the voting did get MiMi Imfurst into AS1.   And Raven could NOT believe it
Lmfao Jaida was third in the voting
Monet was 4th 🥲
It happened MULTIPLE times already
Jaida…?
Lawrence was third after Bimini and Tayce
Well guess what, Mimi?
This thread is everything.
That's exactly what they did for the first three season of UK though...
they’ve done it before so who knows
I'm still salty about Katya there
Yeah I was going to say I could see this influence casting calls for AS more so than the winner of the flagship.
Gisele also very much deserved to win...
She also struggled in the challenges…
They are touring the world together this year and next I believe?
Gotmik really had the most fan support? :o
majority means more than 50%
Oh. Mama I am a Sasha supremacist, I don’t just think Sasha is the best this season, I think she is the best drag queen of all time.
There hasn't been a double winner in the regular season yet lol
You gotta add the /s diva!! The girls will get confused
It absolutely has what  ETA just checked and Seasons 11-14 all had finalists with better PPEs than the eventual winner, as well as Seasons 1 and 9.
not true
most liberal use of the word "objectively" i've seen in awhile lmfao  i'm all for either of these two winning, but girl, objectively? shea couleé is on the phone for you (and brooke lynn hytes, gigi goode...).
I too am team anetra, But it seems more people agree that sasha is the winner (pilla here on reddit) and i would hare to Get another robbed queen storyline that anetra recieved hate for. She does not need to win the crown now, she Will have an amazing career anyways. Besides i would much rather se anetra on AS!:)
Girl don't joke about that
And she made Las Vegas its own state! 🦩🦩🦩   Anetra just has that *energy* ...and her WALK 😍
I think it makes a bigger impact on top 2–Willow and Camden were far and away the top 2 for S14 compared to Daya, Bosco, and Angeria.  S12 was its own thing. No way in hell were they crowning Gigi, and Crystal was… not sure, tbh, but Jaida was the right winner.
I think the fan “votes,” so to speak, hold a lotta sway for that exact reason. A queen who excites and engages the fans IS good for the brand and where it’s going.
I completely agree. Anetra stole my heart. Sasha won my eternal respect.
I agree.   Sasha's GREAT. Anetra's GREAT.   Though... I don't enjoy the railroading of the season for Sasha. I don't enjoy being told who to like based on legacy.
![gif](giphy|bAJykcpSwJY88)  Also, happy cake day!
At least six of them, on the west coast
Most definitely. No one can deny Anetras reach. She truly is a fan favorite for sure.
i could’ve sworn they said finale is tomorrow😭😭
https://www.them.us/story/sasha-colby-ru-pauls-drag-race-season-15-interview
I want Mistress to win too! It goes Mistress, Sasha, then Anetra for me... but apparently everyone else just wants Anetra or Sasha...
notttt your existence. NOT.   LOOOOOL
Sasha really ate them this whole season. Her personality is *chefs kiss*. She deserves the win for different reasons than Anetra, but either one would be fully justified.
These top queens are all phenomenal. I think I could have been clearer by saying “I’d love to see Sasha compete among more established queens. It’s obvious her experience set her apart.
S15 is already an AS5 situation LBR
Then what is the point of having people like/vote for their favorite team/queens? Why ask a question if you're going to completely dismiss it? Popular queens, no doubt, engages fans and thats what the show wants. Watching recent DR finales, its obvious that the top 3/4/5 performances, in my opinion, are just plain showcases. The real 'first round' is completed the moment they receive feedback from the general audience. Yeah its a shady way of deciding a genuine winner but at the end of the day its business, particularly SHOW business
Don’t ever compare me to that wonderbread inbred genetic. I’m black darling. You bitches couldn’t compare.
Do not attack my fans bitch!
STOPPP LMFAOOOO
I could NOT believe it
Out of three 💀
Loss of taste was a common effect of covid so not too surprising
but not by far, the s12 top 3 were all neck and neck
i think she might have been higher on twitter at least
Thankfully Ru crowns the winner instead of the fandom.
Hmm no sweetie Gigi was third. Jaida was second
All Stars is always different
No one won all stars 4
DRUK really is Ru's "we got no sponsors so I'll do what I want" series.
Guess I better go change my costume, change it around
Gisele had winner energy from the first minute
Oh I know, I was rooting for Gisele lol. But when Jada advanced to the top 2, in combination with the kind of weird degree of favouritism and praise she'd received throughout the season, I was actually gripping my seat with anticipation waiting for the winner to be declared. Her edit very easily could've set her up as winner material, but she didn't quite captivate the fans.
I reckon that would not be the case anymore, but she was v popular at the time.
Plurality then. And it’s a big factor for crowning America’s NEXT drag superstar.
I feel this. I knew she was a phenomenal performer before drag race but seeing her absolutely kill the season and make it look so easy has put her #1 imo
If I had to guess that was sarcasm.
Well I agree with you, unless she pulls off a Sasha Velour level reveal, there is no way she will win. Sasha has the best track record, the best résumé as a performer, the other drag queen support, and she is neck and neck with Anetra in terms of fan support. I sincerely hope Im wrong, but I don’t think there is much of a possibility for her to win
How come there was no way in hell they were crowning Gigi? (asking out of curiosity, not because I disagree, I was all for Jaida!)
We really don't often have too many options that *don't* excite and engage the fans though. In the VH1 era, the only ones I can think of were either under-edited (Kameron and A'Keria) or portrayed as villainous (Eureka, Silky, and Daya). Most top 5/4/3 queens *do* excite and engage the fans, so I really don't think it would be a determinant between Sasha and Anetra.
a lot of sway to get Anetra on All Stars
That's how it feels posting in this sub. Before having any kind of less-than-glowing criticism of Sasha, you have to preface it by talking about how amazing and legendary she is lest you get downvoted to hell.   I legitimately just didn't find her as compelling as I found Anetra.
>I don't enjoy being told who to like based on legacy  That part
Very this
![gif](giphy|3o6Ztfv79Gg5bJFFNm)
Yeah, I just saw that, they're saying it's because of an "illness". I hope she's ok...
To get people excited/ hyped and also to make them think their voice matters on who wins. If you want to call it a showcase then do that but as it is now it’s looked at as a way to get into the final 2. What’s even the point of having anything more than the final 2 face off in a lip sync if the others have no chance based of popularity. It’s just shitty imo and I believe the 2 people that do the best in the first round should move on to the final lip sync
It's a vibe
You kiss your mom with that mouth? Shame
From the shit we’ve seen, you don’t have that many!
Underrated comment
Soz sweaty we're talking instagram here
What's wrong with Gotmik?
What’s that?  *I guess the sarcasm is Anetra and I am Marcia…* 🐋
I don't think those are good criteria, though;  * **Best track record:** In season 12, that was Gigi Goode. 11, Brooke Lynn Hytes. 9, Shea Couleé (followed by TTT).  * **Best résumé as a performer:** Not relevant; this isn't RuPaul's Best Performer Outside the Show Race lol * **Other drag queen support:** Again, not really relevant * **Fan support:** irrelevant  We don't know what happens at the finale, and even the spoilerinas don't know how it'll be edited. And given the finale format this show uses, that's *all that matters* really. Jaida didn't have a Sasha Velour level reveal, and still beat Gigi for example. I think it's about 80/20 odds in Sasha's favor, but I think the sub is doing entirely too much seeing it as a foregone conclusion.
Gigi apparently broke the rules and filmed her solo lipsync in a studio and not at home, also a statement on social media "Being queer is a privilege..."
Other person mentioned the COVID protocol breach—frankly she’s lucky WOW had already been forced to disqualify a finalist—but her fate was sealed by the time filming wrapped. She started strong but lost steam halfway through, and then she said she didn’t really pay attention to politics during the political challenge… yeah that was not gonna fly in 2020.   I love Gigi but she had some growing up to do. Someone actually did a writeup about S12 and her fanbase for r/hobbydrama, but it was *really* bad. I think it’s was deleted.
It’s been like that since pre season. The hype has been absolutely crazy
That's a common thing with a lot of queens. For example u can't talk about how great TTT did everytime she was on the show bc, here, ppl choose to believe that she didn't deserved to win AS4 or u can't say anything about Sonique winning AS6 bc she was THE ONLY correct choice apparently....
Oop.
She actually was popular when her first season released originally, she kinda had a underdog arc of baking everyone cookies and then being mean to her (most of her shady moments were probably cut) and then on allstars 1 they showed how bitter she was
Are u sure? I can remember that Gigi was the third on both IG and twitter
I don't think there is anything *wrong* with Gottmik but from what I've seen quite a lot of people have been turned off her based on her attitude post the show.
They’d never crown a winner they don’t think the fan base would accept as a valid winner - see DRDU1. But beyond that fans opinions don’t really matter. Like Luxx has a track record that gives her an outside shot of being a winner (we’ve seen queens with 2 wins/3rd best track record win the crown before) but no way in hell is she being crowned because the fans only see Anetra and Sasha as valid winners
If best résumé as a performer/drag queen wasn’t relevant, they wouldn’t have crown Jinkx over Monet in AS7. The fan support is not a determining factor but it also helps a great deal; there has been a post summing up pre finale fan supports recently and a significant portion of the fan favourite went on to win. If not, ut was the second fan favourite. Very few queen that were third of below in the voting took the crown.  In the end, I agree that saying Sasha basically has it in the bag is hyperbolic. But as you mentioned, the odds are crazy high in favor of Sasha. I hope we get surprised, but I strongly doubt it will happen
i think it was also her being vocally not interested in politics during covid and the 2020 BLM protests, as well as during the politics challenge itself on the show. it was not cool given the amount of people who were literally dying at the time due to... well, the long term effects of people not caring about politics until it affects them, whether it be police violence or shit worker's rights or access to healthcare. Ru might be a capitalist but she was an activist before a lot of viewers could even drink, and her winners become LGBTQ representatives of the LGBTQ community to outsiders. Jaida (who basically radiates light, was pro BLM and showed that you can be a star while locked in a tiny ass apartment) was a better representative for what the people needed at the time. also Jaida equally deserved to win lol, she had a good run and Gigi had some questionable safes
Fucking shenanigans… I did not sign up for this.
I remember liking her a lot back in the day. Like you said she had an campy underdog vibe going on. Lost an old favourite after the various allegations against her came to light.  I never really followed exactly what Alexis' beef with Mimi was when starting that iconic fight. She was upset because... A bar owner removed Alexis from a regular show spot and Mimi accepted the open position? She never explained why she blamed Mimi and not the bar owner for losing her job.
Nah she was third on Twitter but second on IG.
Oh that's a shame. Thank you
They wouldn’t have crowned a girl with 4 wins? Yeah they would’ve lol   An all winners season is completely different in that regard to a regular season anyways…
waitaminute how did you not know what you’re signing up for, d’you already dID THIS, GIRL
I wondered the same about Alyssa Edwards being mad at Coco Montrese and not the pageant.
Ohhh!!
I have also wondered the logic behind both of these fights. Also what was the logic behind Coco hating Alyssa either? Lol was it really Alyssa’s fault people didn’t give Coco the respect she felt she was not getting?  With MiMi vs. Alexis, I think had MiMi not so forcefully shut down Alexis “I’ve listened to you, now you’re gonna listen to me for one hot minute…” there would have been more of a dialogue that would have resolved in MiMi’s favor, but because she came out swinging, it opened the opportunity to let Alexis hit MiMi with the ICONIC “Act a fool gurl… Act a fool” that fully sets off the fight.   Funny how MiMi was low-key on the winning side of both this and the legendary DR fight between her and Shangela, but both times she blows up her own base of argument, let’s her desire to get shady and petty take over, and winds up snatching defeat from the jaws of victory both times.
Well come on Teletubby! TELEPORT US TO __M A R S__!
HUH! I’M ACTING!
Same thing happened last year with Willow and Angeria
does that mean Mistress and Anetra would have been prepping for the finale all this time without knowing if they'd actually perform? like, they found out the day before filming?
This happens every season idk how this is brand new?
Water is wet..?
Spoiler sub had that T since forever.
S9 filmed *every* queen going home. There’s footage somewhere of Shea talking about her exit line that she knew was never gonna get used lmao
DEFINITELY not the day before filming lol. Its usually a few weeks prior the top 4/5 episode so everyone can have the same amount of time to prep and rehearse for the finale.
Either they were told that even though they were prepping they might not make it to the finale or they were told in advance the final outcome and I’m gonna go with the latter bc I highly doubt WOW was gonna spend money on rehearsals just to tell one of them they weren’t gonna make it
in the spoiler sub people were spilling the double save about a month ago, like is on par with when it was spilled with Willow and Angie in S14
As water off a duck's back
Almost like the main sub tries not to post spoilers or something
Willam is not. This article is tho.
I’d think so. I’m just going off of Peppermint’s comment in the article that she found out when the top 4 episode aired. Which in this case would be the day before they shot the finale, right? But obviously that was six years ago and that would be insane
What is the spoiler sub?
Yeah but they recorded both elimination and double shantay.
S9 was the first time that ever happen, so it makes sense that Peppermint just got the short end of the stick. I promise you Angeria and Willow didn’t have a singular day to create, design, and rehearse their performances last year 💀 The girls are given more time to prepare now, trust lol  Also, not all finales are shot the day after the “final elimination” is aired to the public! Some have been shot during the penultimate elimination, so the girls headed into the finale would already know who’s competing by then. S10, S11, and maybe S14 (I’m not sure on this one, I’m truly forgetting) were shot before the final 4/5 episode aired to the general public, so they had to show the final elimination episode to the audience present at the finale taping so they knew which girls made were finalists. Also, thanks to Miss Sasha Velour, the S10 and S11 finalists did receive more time to prep than the S9 ones because they were highly encouraged to have reveals in their lip syncs 💀  S12 and S13 are special because they were pandemic seasons, one being virtual and the other didn’t have an audience. Even then, the Crystal and the S13 finalists knew well beforehand that they were competing in the finale well before they shot it.
In a interview Peopermint said she got a call about a week prior the last competitive episode airing where she was told to prepare for the finale
r/DragRaceTea \- go at your own risk of being crazy spoiled with the posts of the finale
people knew that part a year ago. They only knew it was going to be a double shantay a month ago
1- Puffer Please  2 - Blame it on the Edit Alien  3. - Who is She gown
her beautiful nightmare runway is underrated. we've seen a lot of witches on the show, but she fkn committed. the dress was gorgeous but it was so hard to look at that makeup lmao. truly adhered to the category
I wish the alien would have been her finale look...it was one of the most epic lewwwks I've ever seen!
Taste
I'm an absolute sucker for a Glamour witch who is also actually scary
1. Rip Her to Shreds  2. Puffer Please  3. Tie Dye to Die For  Honorable mention to Everybody Say Glove which probably would make the list with different makeup
I couldn’t choose just 3 tbh
In no particular order:  Beautiful Nightmare  Who is she  Blame it on the edit alien  Rip her to shreds   ....yes they're four, I can't pick
3. House of Matthews swimsuit.   2. Puffer Please.    1. Barb Wire
The Rip her to shreds runway was my favorite by far, but all her looks were stunning.
my fav look is sasha colby
tbf i feel like the makeup was leftover from the rusical, i heard the girls don’t get a ton of time between it & the runway to redo makeup. when she did a photoshoot for it her makeup was diff iirc
Yeah, that's entirely possible
gosh I love Sonja 😭😭😭 she is a true ally
Not Lisa Rinna 😬
Imagine the straights reading this and going 👁️👄👁️
wait this is Lisa Rinna lol I clearly cannot read…
Lips isn’t too popular with most of the fandom right now so your original comment worked really well as shade. Lol

ILLITERATE!
girl I know… but still see her go hard for MIB is nice
Love seeing the drag race girls, dragula monsters and other drag artists working together to help combat what is going on in this country. This lineup is amazing and the best part is you can watch from the comfort of your own home!
I could cry! Digital drag saved me during the height of the panini. Thisnis going to be great!

Ugh great lineup but I have never messed with Twitch before.
Such a killer lineup.  Biqtch's digital drag shows early in the pandemic introduced me to a ton of good music too.
This is gonna be some GOOD shit.
Seriously such a great lineup. I cannot wait for this! It’s going to be what holds me over til the finale
You can just follow the link and watch. Biqtch Puddin hosted these all throughout the height of covid and would always put tip info on the screen if you were able/wanted to tip or donate
Neither have I but it looks like you don’t even need to make an account or anything. I checked it out and it seems like all you do is just watch the video
Hey thanks!
Sure, it’s really simple and a great time! It was always a welcoming environment in the chat and I discovered a ton of amazing performers from all over the world. Would definitely recommend tuning in if you’re able!
What I love about Sasha's looks was that she was never trying too hard. She always wore the outfits, and they never wore her.
“Sasha is so hot. Oh my god…am I a lesbian?”  -Anetra
I’ve never even seen her look bad *off* the show, either.
She never overthought the categories, this season many queens wanted to push the boundaries and be revolutionary but ended up missing the mark with their looks. Sasha went straight to the point
That Pam Anderson….wow!!!! Girl was killing it!!!  I personally I think Symoné has my all time favorite, also Trinity the Tuck turns a good runway!
I don’t know how to describe this, but I don’t feel like her runway package was anything that fully pushed the boundaries of fashion — and in a good way!   Like, they are solid looks. They’re performance-based looks. They’re rich looking, but not overly expensive. They’re *drag* looks!   Drag Race doesn’t have to be a runway fashion show all the time. It can also just be great, campy, dancey, showgirl-style, and accessible looks
I don’t think I’ll ever get over her.
Luxx was branded the fashion queen of the season but to me that title goes to Sasha hands down.
She had the strongest looks of the season, the most wins, the best track record AND she is the best lipsycer, if she doesn’t get crowned I will be starting a riot!
That beautiful nightmare look is still everything 🤩🤩🤩  Sasha is definitely THAT girl!     But please don't forget kim chi, Kim had some amazing looks on the runway
She eats Gottmik for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Imo only ones that touch are Aquaria, Symone, and Carmen  ETA Icesis and Pythia  ETA 2: Utica gets love from me. So many looks queens that are so well rounded and so talented I can’t possibly try to name them all!!
I feel like her eyes are always peering into my soul.  Well, I wish 😂
I think it helps that this was an especially weak runway season overall.
Definitely no boots the whole season. I think Symone has the best package of all time. So cohesive and creative.
I can’t pick a fav because they were all amazing but my top 4 would be alien goddess, barb wire, beautiful nightmare and rip her to shreds
I think about that yellow and black puffer look at least twice a day
Don’t forget the gloves look!
That alien look is one of my all time favs, she looks otherworldly
She basically came with all-stars level runways
Also Utica, can’t forget about her!!
She's the full package and never been in the bottom.
The baseball glove look is literally art, and I don’t see it here. Or Palm Springs?
that first skirt is divine
lol OP subtly slipping gottmik in there
I forgot about that witchy one. So good.
I'll probably get downvoted for this, but there were a lot of amazing looks, and a lot of just ok looks for me.   I did not like the shredded jeans look. It felt a little too much for me. There was a lot going on, and it looked almost messy to me.   I also wasn't a fan of her metallic showgirl look. The spikes drooped on the runway, and the shiny metallic part seemed wrinkled. It was probably nice when it was new, but to me, it looked well worn, and it subtracted from the look.   I also felt that Beyonce look was really simple. You're recreating Beyonce. She's been in the public eye for decades. You could have taken that brief so far. When she came out on the runway, it was just meh for me, but of course, everyone praised it.   I think she's incredibly talented and has put forth a lot of amazing looks, but I also think it's fair to say she got judged less harshly than previous competitors because she's Sasha Colby.
I feel like its so easy for Sasha, she’s not hungry like Anetra.
I’d switch Mik with Crystal Methyd
I say switch Aquaria with AS2 Detox and we have a deal
I’d add Kylie to that list
Thank you for these. She is my favorite. I love her spirit, her personality, her skills, and her talent. It’s fun to root for her.
The Pam Anderson one was fine, but that’s not a dig at Sasha because she did genuinely look beautiful. It’s just more that SO MANY people did Pam looks last year due to the show, that it frankly is just like “we get it, unique costumes please.” Same with all the girls wearing Harley Quinn costumes, and the inevitable millions of M3GANs we’ll get this year.
![gif](giphy|10JhviFuU2gWD6)  This gave me a good laugh whew.
Y’all are fully tripping if you think that rainbow look would be passable on any other Queen. Sorry it’s cheap and bad looking. The rest are solid toots, nothing extraordinary or boundary pushing. I wish she’d have worn that alien look for the runway and not 10 seconds of someone else’s music video
She's rich, she has the money and the resources. it's not that surprising that she ended up serving us. I was hoping for something very gagworthy tho like Violet's death becomes her runway kind of thing but Sasha's looks were still phenomenal
THIS is why she’s getting the win hopefully
That music video look makes me happy to be bi
Thank god for Sasha. Without her the runways wouldve been rough.
Sasha just looks so beautiful 🥹🥹🥹
Ridiculously photogenic and absolutely stunning.
Yes! Sasha shines through.
exactly so it is not as obvious as a younger fashion queen who got these outfits made for the show, which there is nothing wrong with that but the way Sasha carries herself, it seems that this level of excellence is nothing new to her, which gives of winner energy.
Definitely confirmed I am less than straight.
I'm telling you, I was too young for OG Pam Anderson Barbarella, but seeing Sasha I completely understand. Was absolutely questioning my sexuality child. Those curves needed a warning label.
They have different things to prove. Sasha is a legend where as someone like Luxx or Anetra are up and comers. Sasha just needs to show why she is a legend, whereas Luxx needs to prove she can be one. There's more risk taking in proving yourself.
Who? I felt like even the “fashion queens” like Luxx weren’t trying to break boundaries or anything, they where just cute ass outfits
good runway looks, but terrible, terrible lip sync looks
Idk from who I heard it first Bob or Violet but they said "you don't have to reinvent the wheel every time you step on the runway" and I think that's perfect. Sometimes just referencing your idols will pay off fabulously like it did Symone.
Sasha’s still a pageant girl at heart. She brings *drag*.
100% agree. Garments are great but not groundbreaking. However, the difference is that she’s incredible at modelling and selling anything as high fashion. She won Miss Continental for a reason! On the other side of the spectrum, Utica managed to lose the design challenge with probably the best outfit ever made on drag race because she couldn’t model at all.
If I were looking for someone to style an ad campaign, I would hire Luxx. If I were looking for someone to star in an ad campaign, I would hire Sasha Colby
Am I the only one who found Luxx's out of drag looks more interesting than her mainstage looks?  Like when everyone was in normal clothes and Luxx was in a bathrobe I was like "this is interesting, tell me more"
I will join you. I can’t wait to see her in the finale!
But... kim chi isnt a waif who can wear straps of fabric over their goodies and get praise for it.  Edit: not sasha lol.
100% agree with Icesis & Pythia. So good. Would’ve loved to have seen more of Suki Doll’s looks too.
100% agree I dont understand the hype for Gottmik
When Sasha walked out in that gloves look, I was like “dolls, go home. The category hath been closed officially”
I can’t believe it took me so long scrolling to find someone bringing up the gloves look. That’s my favourite of the season. Sheer brilliance.
She's in a league of her own.
To be fair the entire cast was hungry cuz they know they're not Sasha
No, if anything I think Sasha is the hungriest of them all. She just makes it look effortless.
Bjork's girl? She up in this gig?
It's just different. They have different things to prove as people that are at different places in their career. As a young chef I needed to prove I could innovate and create and as a seasoned chef I have to prove that I can be precise and professional and consistent. Different expectations
there’s no need for hunger when you’re eating the entire cast up and are a tier above them.  we’ve seen more fighting from anetra because she’s been in the bottom 3 times
Detox in AS2 was everything
So Sasha twice
I was just thinking it's pretty gagworthy to do Pam so well I basically forgot everyone else's.
Violet in a corset is groundbreaking? Girl …
Made me question if I'm actually gay 😂
Or was it RuPaul on her coffee enema?
I mean I think she modelled the shit out of her sleeping bag look tbh. Were her other looks that episodes over performed? Sure I can see that, not that I have any experience with modelling whatsoever. But I thought she sold her sleeping bag gown incredibly well and it was by the THE BEST look ever made in the workroom still to this day. I can't get over how she didn't win on that look alone
Count me in
Girl what?
You can say gottmik 🫢
Icesis is light years better on that runway than Pythia
lets not lie gottmik had some hall of fame runways  the gold lame, the pocket watches, the purple monster, little black dress, hairpin fascinator   plus her pinhead look and finale look from the final ball thingy are easily 2 of the best looks of all time
![gif](giphy|xLcPXVtfyN9bzz5Aoc)
...fair
^youaintgottoreinventthewheel
She had a hall of fame set of connections and budget though. Queens like Symone and Sasha had influence / worked on their runways *personally*, while a lot (if not all) of Gottmik’s runways were just gifted/bought. That’s why Gottmik gave more traditional fashion while others (like Symone) had more unique and culturally significant/personal references, which I think is worth applauding
Mik essentially did Valentina’s Madonna look as a little black dress. It was cheeky, but not groundbreaking
This was just really fabulous on multiple levels.
… and
she still looked sickening in those so idk what that has to do with it
girl 💀  like do u know her personally like how can u make that statement
Because we can't just let gottmik be sickening, we have to "qualify" it, or explain why it wasn't real or something... it's one of the rules of the sub apparently  I mean, you could do that with any queen, because every queen had help, took advantages, and has history... as well as every queen has had adversity and has had their own struggles   But for some reason every time mik comes up, it's this whole thing about how she daddy warbuxed her way in or something, or she's veruca salt or something, and no one else gets that treatment
Where did I say he didn’t still look good💀 he is one of the best fashion queens we’ve had. I’m just providing another perspective
Knowledge is FREE bestie. Just head to Gotmikk’s instagram and see the designers that he worked with and watch some interviews on the connections he has based on his former career as a famous MUA. ❤️
acting as if symone didnt have a whole house also helping her with her package?   they both ate so idk why we have to qualify when we praise gottmik
yea.. symone worked with her house to create her runways.. that’s very different than buying and wearing something that was already made💀   Idk why you think I’m saying they’re both not sickening, I’m just saying there’s something more admirable about having personal touches in fashion vs just wearing fashion. Anyone could put on something Gottmik wore but very few people could create concepts like Symone’s durag look and her BLM look.

Who's afraid of a salad bar
Came to post this but the queens are too fast and too furious - she ate
Mistress ate but Bob devoured this track. I need Mistress on the Podcast NOW. I need to hear Monet’s messy ass comments.
I just saw She Devil By Night, girl
"In a room full of bottoms you couldn't top one" I liked that, felt seen.
So to all y’all hoes sleeping on Bob… yeah. Point blank. Periodt. One of the strongest winners of in franchise HERSTORY. She’s letting hoes know. But in actuality this was fire and I’m obsessed. Wait so are they really fighting or is it still playful shade?
Uggghhhh.  That was fucking EVERYTHING. Pardon me while I go watch this another 16 times in a row.
![gif](giphy|nz3fsgdWF2OxwWSL8U)
Bob devoured
BOOOOOOBBBB 😭😭😭😭😭  there are so many good lines in there it's ridiculous... the "let loose" snippet, top four v top one, left hook, chevelle, 14 episodes... bob *ate*.
![gif](giphy|HxmqkwsCsEZ7cQGs74)
Bob won.  ![gif](giphy|l46CnZfBGWGRVHOJW|downsized)
AAAAAAAAAA I'M GAGGED
'how you got two faces but you got three chins?', Bob said *I was told there'd be no math*
 Not Chevelle gon feel it , BOB 😩😂😩😂
My god this is genius. Bob ate. No crumbs.
OH SHE ATE
I love this. The creativity. The musicality. The fun shade.  These girls are world class entertainers and I can't wait to see what else MIB is going to achieve!   And Bob ate. No crumbles. The sheets are crumble-less
Bob ate her tf up i’m so sorry 😭😭 absolutely annihilated
MIB’s track was good but Bob DEVOURED. Love the surprise Selener feature at the end 😭
BOB WENT OFF SOOOOOOO HARD HOLY SHIT
Let’s be honest the one with the better audio quality should automatically win 💀
Bob is a legend. That was so good
Bob bodied Mistress. It’s almost unfair.
Bob once again ATE. Munch, munch, crunch, crunch.
[Here is Mistress's track.](https://www.reddit.com/r/rupaulsdragrace/comments/12dukxc/mistress_isabelle_brooks_sneak_releases_her_diss/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1) You decide who runs the show.
Bob this whole season has proved why she will forever be my favorite queen. She chewed mib up 😅
You know what im glad Bob mentioned it. Mistress doing the titty bounce in ~~every lip sync.~~ everything.  &#x200B;  MISS ME
This 👏 is 👏 brilliant 🔥 🔥
I just left the doctor about my depression but here I am suddenly beaming from ear to ear
You 'bout to find out who's the real SheDevil AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Absolutely fucking speechlessss!!!! I want them to keep going, I want more diss tracks
Bob left no survivors. Bob killed this track and is an extremely excellent rapper!!
Missed the obvious Robbie Turner cameo with “you came in an Uber but you leave in a hearse”
Bob won and it's really not close. I don't highly prefer one over the other so I have no horse in this race.
Damn I thought it was a mistake to step to Bob in a verse battle in the first place but she DESTROYED Mistress. Hardly a competition haha.
She ate, She consumed, she devoured, she ingested, she digested and shat all over MIB 😭😭😭
Fuck, I love being gay
YOLANDA SALDIVAR WHOS AFRAID OF A SALAD BAR OOMMMFFFGGGGG
I have to say... Bob did the thang. One take. The editing. The references. Comments left turned on. Less filler lines. It's all so good.
Does anyone have a link to the Salina video she added at the end? I don’t know where that’s from but it’s giving
BOB DID THAT
Bob is such a good writer.
Was that Bob v MIB or Shady v MGK?
I love every single word of this. Iconic.
munch munch crunch crunch Bob ate mistress during quarantine for lunch
Yeah. Bob cleared her.  It is absolutely criminal that Bob never got to do a verse challenge.
The end with Salina was perfection!
Fuck why isn't this viral yet
Bob entering her Pusha T era
Imagine trying to pay me, with this bill?
YOUR BODY, YOUR CHOICE 💀
ATE THAT BITCH FULLYYY
LMAO the "X"
Mistress Isabelle brooks BROOKS
If we don’t get a diss track challenge on all winners 2… I’ll be fuming
This is just a serve. For those who are wondering this is how you throw shade.  It's definitely filled with humor so it's still good natured. Some other queens should take note.
Bob proving the old adage “youth & enthusiasm are no match for old age and treachery”  Did someone mention art?
maybe its just bcus im violently stoned right now but i feel like im gonna pop a lung laughing theres LAYERS to this shit oh my god
RIP Misstress. Glad they filmed the finale before this dropped or there would have been a final three
I need Lemon and Bob to collab on a track where they alternate going for each others’ throats
I AM LOSING MY MIND
Increddddddddddible!
Okay and don’t try to fight me cuz I know how you girls like to tussle….but is this serious or lite fun shade? I’m outta the loop girlies! Also bob ate that.
Bob ateeeeee
Bob the DRAG HER queen. yes.
"You came in an uber, but you leave in a hearse" DAMN
too many iconic reads in one video 😭
Wow!!
ROBERTA I AM SCREAMING!   She said OH HUNTY you gonna seat the F down for a hot minute while I EDUCATE YOU.
I listened to both and, Mistress, BUH BYE!
Bob is just always so smart. Probably one of the smartest queens in my opinion! Love Bob and will continue to say it!
Yeah, she ate that bitch up. As expected, though. Imagine trying to go against one of the only good lyricists of this whole franchise
There’s a reason that Bob is my all-time favourite queen
This is everything! When she does the “give the bitch a snack” line and does that shoulder thrust that MIB does every single time. Hilarious
Okay this is going on my summer playlist 🔥
I FUCKING LOVE BOBBBBB!!!
i love both of these women but bob ate this down
Need to know if the uber/hearse line is a Robbie Turner reference
Bob not only ate...she FEASTED.
Yassss! This was amazing!
This is WILD! (Fucking Amazing)
Diss track? I need the diss ALBUMMMM baybeee! 👛🤏 this was fire 🥵
Bob is seeding all the stuff needed to make him the next QoaQ and I’m ok with it. Between this and his impersonation of Selina 🤣
i'm sorry but i love bob so much she just cannot lose. the bitch slays everyone.
This surprisingly how I’d the the lipsync between Anetra and Spice going. Bob really annihilated MIB 😮‍💨
OMG this better than Shakira's diss track, and I thought I was about to drop dead when that dropped.
Is there any backstory I missed that lead to this diss track? 👀
This is Mistress’ response? Sorry, Bob won. There are max four lines in her words that were a gag. Bob’s ENTIRE RAP was a ruthless, masterful, skin-you-alive lyrical Hiroshima. I really like MIB. She’s a bad bitch who brings it every time, but this was a blowout. https://youtu.be/0VBBOYnfts8  P.S. It just sounds like a great first draft. Also, how you gonna tag in another bitch on your reply to a diss track? What, you need a flow crutch to hold up ya rhymes?
Oh no the gays are fighting
Bob is always excellent but I dunno that Ezra line from Mistress was a kill shot.
MIB didn’t know what they was signing up for…. 👀
Is there Drama??? I wanna know lol
This mid tier fight is what twinks live for.
What the fuck!? There is so much drama all of a sudden! How did this even start?! I’m on all the subs and I missed it!
Is this fued even real. Like what
Was actually dope. Gas MIB done one too?
Everyone syllable was on point! But did anyone expect any less?
Roberta ate Mistress UP.
I’m here for all this old school vs new school drama!
Bob ate her up of course, but Mistress’ Ezra namedrop was one of the nastiest, most out-of-pocket burn of the decade
I think Bob might be the winner of drag race, periodt.
I knew Boobalina would win😂
I’m team drama
Who's afraid of a salad bar?
Bob writing bars like the biggur the better baby
Living for this!  I’m sure this all in fun spirit but could someone catch me up with what’s going on? I’m not on other social networks
Put this in a museum
Has Bob just spoiled who gets cut next for me 🤦🏻‍♀️
🧠💪
Please tell me BOB was at the finals? Audience questions!!!!!!
![gif](giphy|gtakVlnStZUbe)
> I mean it doesn’t make sense mathematically to me but your body your choice   ☠️☠️☠️
This is the exact spot I paused and came to the comments because I OOP'd IRL fr fr.
Roberta really said CLOSED CASKET ⚰️
Your body, your choice.
💀☠⚰
Bloop. I live 🙈
I am GAGGGGEDDDDD
Trinity is damn how am I catching strays here.
The small snippet of LET LOOSE when she mentions loosey lmaoo
Bob is so powerful that she is writing a disstrack targeting one win queen and half the queendom are catching strays lol
Damn I thought it was a mistake to step to Bob in a verse battle in the first place but she DESTROYED Mistress. Hardly a competition haha.
She's about to start the sequel to Rattatouille the Musical
Once again, Bob serving CUNT.
the LAYERS to this 🧠
I had to google this reference and omg 💀💀💀💀
🥵🔥☠️
Saldivar?
Uh it's obviously darienne lake
Lemon and Alaska are both good but Bob comes out way ahead.
I liked The Vixen in shea’s song Cocky, and that drag through the ages song, her verse was good
Aja, Shea, Yvie
Amberfist think it Kidz Bops
Not just deceased but FOUND DEAD IN A GUTTER era, oh lawdy.
God that’s so funny to me because from where I’m standing, Monét might have a baby sister by early next year 💀
Was gonna say, mistress will be loving this.
i saw a hate comment on twitter the other day that said "bob is too weak for all winners so has to cause dumb twitter beef to stay relevant" and i died
You win.
Why are we all gagging so, Roberta brings it to us every song!
Mistress a big girl, she could eat too now
When she rhymed "Shedevil by Night" with "I take D-lite when I GET TO fight" I clapped
Side note via your .gif:  I would like to see Acid Betty return for another season.  There was something incredibly damaged about her, and I would like to think she worked through it.  I really appreciated her airbrushing and clothes.
That is exactly why they avoided it, Ru doesn't need someone outshining her.
Bob didn’t have a comedy/stand up challenge, a lyric challenge, or a tic tac lunch (lol I liked that they just skipped right over season 8).
That part!!!!  I am fully deceased and loving every second lol
Couldn’t top Jose and couldn’t top Juan
THANK YOU. Youtube's captions gave up at not even a minute in lmao
I was literally driving trying to post this cause I knew someone else would if I waited 😅 Don't Reddit and drive people
YEEEEES! THIS NEEDS TO HAPPPEN! I have been caaacckllling
the way Monet would be instigate fights if Mistress gets on the podcast 😭😭😭
There is a reason that Bob is opening for Madonna on her world tour!
If she was in all stars I can’t imagine her not winning tbh… even if like Sasha wins this season and does the same all winners.
Why couldn’t I stop? Then I had to go back and watch read you wrote you for the billionth time…then back to Bob
Plz explain who Chevelle is for the ignorant among us?
This gif just took me OUT
I'm an MIB stan but this was an annihilation.
It's Bob...CLEARLY
Mistress gets a participation award
Not only is Bob’s verse a thousand times better, he delivers two verses to camera in a single take each.  This fake feud is hilarious and I’m on team Bob.
It's Bob. It's almost always gonna be Bob. Idk if I can think of a time where it wasnt Bob.
I like it well enough for this battle to be really fun.
How can I unhear this?
Thanks for sharing. Mib sounded super scripted and edited
You just mad u can’t bounce ur tiddies
I mean she only did it really like twice and Anetra duck walked... in five lip syncs not counting her talent?
Why is this line so spicy? I can’t remember the reference
Oh my!!!!! Search for stuff about Salina and Ross Matthews. You’ve missed some beautiful tea
You can eat both of our asses f*ggot  I screamed... References all the fucking way through
I think it's headed that way!
It's just silliness/drag kayfabe IMHO but damn, it's fun.
It's silly podcast stuff. Which makes it all the more fun. So few of the girls engage positively with Monet and Bob over their commentary, so I'm very happy to see it. MIB has truly cemented herself as a favorite after this. Creative and authentic.
It's just a for fun thing. It's not serious
It’s fake lol
It started on the podcast, it’s for fun.
It's just jokes luv
It’s all in good fun!
Yes its on her youtube page
It's like 1PM on a Monday or something I was not ready to be in such a gay shock today wtf
Waiting for the Trinity diss track and for Luxx to reply to that one leading Loosey release a track boasting her 20 mini challenge wins and—
The cackle I let out at that
Icon recognizing icon
i truly spit my coffee out   LET LOOSE ! ✨👏🏻
Bob gave a masterclass
Mistress is the best thing to happen to the franchise in a LONG time, she has that old school messiness and quiet IDGAF attitude that has been missing! Love her, love Bob, I am so entertained.
oh jaysus no
The first thing mistress said to Selena in episode 1 is that she can be Yolanda I was cracked
![gif](giphy|35iDQ9U6aSzbq)
Yo toenail draggin 😳
Something something dirty feet
that Bob and Alaska collab for yet another dig song was amazing
I NEED a collab with all three
I think Lemon is the only one who can lyrically stand up to Bob and even that's more of a headcannon than reality.
That's what I thought!!! I hope Monet collabs on taking ddown the bully Bob! :P /jk
I can't even...on the other hand. Shit more engagement :P
two now, or even three!
Yes! She switched up her flow like three different times in this rap and it was fluid, flowing poetry. A natural talent. Bob the Drag Queen really seems to be doing what she was born to do. So grateful and happy to witness it. Love that bitch.
Can you explain this one to me? I feel silly and dont get it :(
Hope you’re joking if not you’re a fucking moron 😍
Gurl don't do that. Karma is meaningless, your health and safety (and other people's safety) is NOT.
A reddit post is not worth it, you better not drive and be on reddit at the same time. It’s giving clown era.
I need to see the behind the scenes of Bob writing this because I know the bitch was hyping herself up
PERIODDDDD. A INCREDIBLE WINNER
chevelle brooks is mistress’ drag mom 👩
Same! 😂 I don't think there will ever be a more perfect time to use it unless Blair goes back on All Stars and Bob hosts the Pit Stop again.
Mistress has some good lines with the sweater, Ezra, and We're Here references. I was a bit puzzled by any attempts to say Bob has never been on top, her career is not doing well, etc. Final nail was saying DERRICK beat Bob on season 8? Should've said Kim Chi - still 2 syllables, is much more plausible than Derrick, and Bob has admitted he was slightly concerned since Kim was the fan favorite.
I would like to add that Mistress won the thumbnail battle IMO.
![gif](giphy|e616P1jLmpxnyPmuFw|downsized)
I'm mad I don't have any fat to rub together..
False. ![img](emote|t5_2t3or|4803)  [https://youtu.be/XLG\_HtStTvo?t=71](https://youtu.be/XLG_HtStTvo?t=71)  [https://youtu.be/9jJ1GXDDFdE?t=87](https://youtu.be/9jJ1GXDDFdE?t=86)  [https://youtu.be/k4c\_0OI2EcM?t=163](https://youtu.be/k4c_0OI2EcM?t=163)  [https://youtu.be/n52vB0BuaG0?t=216](https://youtu.be/n52vB0BuaG0?t=216)  [https://youtu.be/z2ADnJXNEig?t=72](https://youtu.be/z2ADnJXNEig?t=72) (loud)  &#x200B;  Nobody was talking about Anetra.
Lmao Anetra is a fan favorite so you can’t say anything possibly bad about her. Both of them have done their signatures several times.
Thank you! I was really hoping it was just for fun! I wish more girls would do the same! I also think MIB set a good example for someone who knows how to throw fun shade and calls it like she sees it without being malicious.
I had a feeling. Thats fun
It’s so fucking funny, this is one of my fave things to happen in a long time
Thanks doll!
If you think today is Monday, have I got some fantastic news for you…
>Mistress  >quiet  🤔
Mean spirited tho, taking away from Sasha's deserved win
I think it was just a reference to Bob’s line in Gay Barz where he says “I don’t speak Spanish, but I will top a tio” referencing the topatio hot sauce
I also think a call back to MIB's story for the stand up challenge
> 😍  This part sent me lol
It's exaggerated but I was in the car  ![gif](giphy|0eWLQ3gflh8SmA2SpN)
Depends who you ask
It was much ruder to say Derrick. Remember Derrick on season 8? Hahahahahha. It was the correct choice. Plus they fought.
Bob was in the lyrics lmao and all I said was: she ain't the only one repeating something every lip sync. Girlll it's NOT that deep lmao
Have you heard the good news?
Tío is guy in Spain, I think it makes more sense than Tapatío hot sauce.
Givin me a certain queens fake covid test vibes with these comments
Let's ask whoisshetho001-192
No, the truth is always the correct choice, because it's what hurts the most.
GiRl ItS nOt thAt DeEp.  You said I was wrong then tried to deflect onto Anetra (for some reason) I proved I wasn't. Take a few seats.   &#x200B;  here I will edit my statement to help you sleep better tonight.
Lmao yes that makes more sense. My brain just went to the hot sauce.
I never said you were wrong, I said she only did it in like the two lip syncs, which in the run of the show is mostly true. Jfc, someone's having a bad day. I warmed the chair for you
She only lip synced twice hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
![gif](giphy|3oEjHDTsGOIq1xOpvW)
Did she not only lipsync for her life twice?... lalaparuza and the top four episode?
Ew lol ok. 👍🏻
You said “she only did it in like two lip syncs” implying there were times she lip synced on the show and didn’t do it. It was funny.
All I'm saying is I am glad bob mentioned Mistress doing the titty bounce because I also noticed it a lot and don't like it.  I don't need someone reeeeing in and trying to disprove me and giving me a whataboutism for Anetra's duck walk when that wasn't part of the convo.  &#x200B;  Good?
Yeah, but my comparison is other queens lip synced more and also reused the same move over and over again. Both statements can be true
You're still going?... oooooof

I cant believe Ra’Jah was the last winner, feels like that was 10 months ago. Congrats to Drag Couenne!
After every winner, I wait for you to post an update 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 Thank youuu
Couenne ate the competition UP. She's one of the very few queens who I think could've been in the top every single episode.
She’s also the first winner of 2023!
Félicitations Couenne ! Sasha & Admira next please 👏🏻
One of the most-deserving Drag Race winners of all time. I was nervous she was going to be too PUNK for the franchise, but she delivered a pitch-perfect season on the level of past champions like Bob and Carmen Farala.
Sorry who is that? Drag Couenne?
44 winners. Soon to be FORTY FIVE. It’s . . . A bit crazy.
very soon there’s gonna be more Drag Race winners than US presidents, and we deserve that
we've had 10 winners since willow damn
She was the most capturing queen for me. Even more than Carmen in ES1. I fell in love with her from the very start. Very deserved. Congrats, my Couenne.
Wow Blu Hydrangea looks unreal in her photo. She's the one left of Willow, right?
Mother  ![gif](giphy|xUPGcC0R9QjyxkPnS8)
Cant wait to see the DRMX winner here
Wow look at the space between Carmen and Sharonne
The undisputed winner of Belgique 👏👏👏
Drag couenne is amazing! She was my pick from day one. Admira and Sasha next!  ![gif](giphy|26ueZRfwp2qAjYgH6)
Where’s Sasha Colby?
anetra is coming
I honestly thought it was gonna go to Athena. I think just because she gave me major Paloma vibes.
Kinda wild that the last season i watched Jinx's. There have been so many since then!
who’s behind rajah?
She was amazing all season and her final lipsync really topped it off, after a season of mediocre lipsyncs she gave something I'd pay to see
To bad the host is so not right for the show.
The season was... There. But Couenne is an amazing queen, I Think she could do very good in an All Winners season.
As always you're the winner of Challenge. You're a winner baby. We always wait for this montage my brother and I .
my pleasure bestie, is like the drag version of Mortal Kombat
say it louder
the one and only
Also 44 winners and 11 of them in 2022. Wow.
yas, she is! and she looks STUN
Pakita is coming
Next week she's here
to All Stars
Blu is fierce, move on.
La Diamond, flawless winner of DR ITA Season 2
my pleasure 🤗
Good for her, she definitely deserves that spot
and 2023 will have a lot more than 11 lmao
You’re right mug is stamped acts are camped. I’ll delete it.
the bob and ezra line ate oop
She stepped to one of the TOP tier verse writers and diss trackers of drag race? I'm a delusional Mistress stan and all, but damn Bob ate her up. Can't wait for those two to be besties though because I bet this is all for publicity.
I love this “feud” 😂   Bob ate though, she’s my winner
Did she record this over Zoom?
I’m looking forward to the (hopeful) string of diss tracks that come after this
I listened to this after Bob’s and was highly disappointed
"she can't even pick a sweater that her best friend likes"  Mistress is the comedy queen of the season!!!  ![gif](giphy|26tOWN9hVlImb0c9O)
I know it’s all fun and the beef is clearly vegan but even ignoring production quality, Bob *devoured* Mistress, lol
Bob ate Mistress up. But that Ezra line was golden. Did Monet not teach MIB audio mixing , cause you could barely hear her at times.
Bob nuked Mistress from high Earth orbit.
You can tell Mistress actually listens to the podcasts. Only a cousin could have known about some of these jabs.  Also, the thumbnail is genuinely top tier troll meme. Lol
THE CHIPPY LINE 😭😭😭
It’s official. Monet and Bob were already my favorites but I have to add Mistress now. I need her on the podcast ASAP. All three of the hoes crack me up 😭
Girl, the Ezra line just fucking killed me
This is…something.
This was cute, but Bob's was drop dead gorgeous ![img](emote|t5_2t3or|4812) the line about her having two faces and three chins omg
*"If this was rags to riches, Bob must be the before"*![img](emote|t5_2t3or|4812)![img](emote|t5_2t3or|4812)![img](emote|t5_2t3or|4812)
Bob: 1     MIB: 0
Disstress Isabelle Brooks
This beef is the kind of benevolent gay bundle-of-stickery I live for.
THE EZRA LINE IM DYING
She cleared I fear
The Ezra reference is incredible but the real tea was spilled when she mentioned The Sweater.
Bob ate, but this was fun.
Twas good, but bob decimated her. Miss Thedragqueen is in the top tier of diss track writers, so I am not surprised
My hearing is so bad that I only got about five words. Caught all of Bob's though. Bob wins again.
Well, I guess there’s room for everybody, let’s just say that
I wish she had a better mic but this was so good
Lmaooo love bob & MiB
Bobs was wayyyy better
She went wild
She is sooooo funny to me. What an absolute star + joy
LMFAOO
Mistress did a good job and honestly I hope we get more queens doing this for funsies.   Bob ate her ass up, tho. It was brilliant.
golf clap.
Not Sweatergate 5.0, it's the Broc-ally of SR
bob ate her ass up for real. mib did a cute job but she struggled with the beat and had way too many syllables at times
Bob ate. Negative crumbs.
I’m going to miss Mistress so much. She brings so much fun even after the show. Her Twitter is amazing
Meh--Bob's is waaaaaaaaay betta
Bob….then Salina at the end…yeah.
Let’s make this a thing.  Queens, start your dis tracks and may the best bitch, win!
S12 who? This is the only I’m that bitch that I know now
THE SWEATER REFERENCE!!! 💀
She tried... Especially with that Ezra line.
![gif](giphy|GyCc8fM1O2VofE2ZUu|downsized)  Mistress ate Bob up I fear
I have a feeling "Chippy" is gonna stick 😂😂
I love all of this. Mistress (and Bob) bringing back old school Drag Race Tees and it is so refreshing.
I know this is all cute fun but Bob just wrecked this ho. But whatever, it’s all just fun. Wrecked.
“Diss”  However, “you can’t even pick a sweater that your best friend likes” gave me a good giggle.
Mistress is too fucking funny. There’s no option but to be a fan
I’ve been at work. Is there evidence that this is real beef or is it contrived?
I feel like Mistress was so specific with her bars on this, the real HITS are going over people’s heads. Bob was like you are fat and didn’t win drag race, and Mistress was like your relationship failed and your “friends” don’t care about you. It’s giving IVE DONE THE HOMEWORK!
Bob cleared her, it’s not even close 😂 I love this “feud” though
Lol she went all the way in ! Lol
Yeesh
Gurl, this was bad. Couldn't listed pass 15 seconds of the so call "diss track".
Weird
What's on the Bob & Monet's reference on sweater?
Now we know who Nicki’s and Cardi’s ghostwriter be.  ![gif](giphy|h6fBXWeFoPexm0YGUM|downsized)
The gasp I gusp when she said that
The only line that did…
who's Ezra? ezra miller?
I don’t think Mistress is so delusional she didn’t realize she’d be eaten alive. Bob is also one of the biggest queens to have ever been on the show, either way this collab is a win for Mistress.
Was the verse better on Bob’s or was it the better beat. They both threw some real licks on their tracks.
Bob ate the moment I couldn’t hear MIB over the backing track. Sorry I’m my bobble head era
Bob ate in the first damn 30 seconds...name another queen, you can't
She recorded it on the MacBook Salina sold her
She recorded it on the mic Loosey used episode 1
She recorded it while Ross Matthews was eating Salina’s ass.
She recorded it in one day since the "beef" started yesterday. It definetly wasnt in a professional booth and probably was zoom or smth
Bob demolished her
Bob demolished her
Same. Ain't a good sign that it was significantly longer and she repeated some diss lines
I didn’t get the meaning behind that line, what’s the context?
You can tell Mistress is a friend of the pod and a proud Monation citizen
Without a doubt
You haven't heard Bobs yet have you? Bob ate her up!!!
Of course it’s in your head. Why should that mean that it’s not real?  -Some Gay Wizard
It’s all for fun
How is it weird dummy

Bob’s ex 💀
Bob’s Ex, not Ezra Miller
Girl...
I’m saying I’m delusional not her :). And this really was the point of the last sentence too
Forget all the other eras, mistress stays in the delusional one lol
You're getting the most room temperature spot in hell when we get there
I didn’t know she had one! Can you link it?  Edit: It’s on her YouTube channel [here](https://youtu.be/QY_FB1H8FWY)
She sure did. Two faces but three chins. Gold.
How you got two faces but three chins is such a good line
Bob gave Monet a sweater and there have been MANY arguments surrounding said sweater and if Monet has ever worn it
on their podcast there’s a running thing about how Bob bought a custom sweater for monets birthday and how she refuses to even try it on
Other commenters mentioned the main gist of it, but basically on Sibling Rivalry there's a constant running joke (which at this point Bob says her feelings are genuinely hurt) where Bob says she gave Monet a sweater that she thought Monet would love, but Bob has never seen Monet wear it before.   Monet swears that she wears it and likes it, but refuses to send Bob a photo of her wearing it just based on the principle that she doesn't want to be told to send Bob a photo of her "enjoying" her gift. Bob doesn't believe Monet likes it (or has even still has it?) because she says if Monet did like it, she'd prove it by at the very least taking a photo of her wearing it at home and sending that photo to Bob.
Bob’s track is incredible. This track is fun and mix quality issues aside the only line that really hits for me is the Ezra line because it’s hitting on some level of truth. But MIB says “look at Bob’s career” as a diss when Bob has a makeup line, successful podcast, three seasons of an HBO Max show, and is about to open for Madonna so… At the end of the day though I’m just having fun along with them as they are clearly enjoying themselves with this fake fight.
Yeah, but I love Mistress too much to admit she got destroyed so I just copied the comment I put on Bob's track and switched the names around
Can you clarify?
Bob dated Ezra Miller??!!
omg lol, what happened w/ his ex? i'm so out of the loop
This comment and your name weirdly check out
NURSE!!
That was so fucking good.
Fuuuuuuuuck
It’s fake drama.
Yes! Bob was in The Flash and that's how they met. It's really sweet actually but Bob had to leave the relationship cos of Ezra's antics.
Oh I wish, can you imagine the chaos.
No. Ezra Michel
I’m not sure there’s much of a story to be had lmao, they were dating and then they weren’t ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I know Ezra released a song that a lot of people thought was about Bob/their relationship, but I think it got blown more out of proportion than real life.
🔥🔥🔥🤸‍♀️🔥🔥🔥

Right? I’ve watched it soo many time already🔥
I thought so. That makes it waaay more fun. I’m averse to in-fighting within the community.
What did Ezra do?
Lol. Bob gave his ex free publicity for the song released. Meh. Not a real fight. It ended amicably.

Why Canada versus the World is called an event season?
The Grag Queen erasure 😤
Probably because there won't be another season
The game within a game lip syncs were filmed the episode following their elimination. You can tell by the constantly rotating judges during the Smackdown. Also, when you get eliminated, you're just packing up your stuff to take it off the set. They're not driving you to the airport, they're driving you back to the hotel.
all were the following week (as the girls were potentially battling a girl that went after them), except for Eureka who went right back to the main stage (the judges are the same as with Pandora vs Silky and the Drag Tots episode).
I think it was like a week after the most recent eliminated queen. Like Serena vs jiggly was on week three. All except eureka who was right after her elimination
I don't know why you'd assume they couldn't fit a lipsync in between the shots of them writing their mirror message and the shots of them getting into the van.
Yeah I need to look back and see how the judges fit in, if they’re the ones from the same week they’re eliminated or if they’re from the week later.
You’re right! I’d thought about this but thought the guest judges lined up with it being the same night as their elimination, but I’ve just looked at the judges for each rudemption lipsync and it’s the judge from the next week up until Charlie X is there for two, showing that the Silky v Pandora and Silky v Eureka we’re on the same night. So it looks like they got eliminated, de-dragged and packed away, got the TV message and we’re filmed getting in the van. Then they came back after the next elimination to do their own rudemption song.
It’s just with them being out of drag when they’re writing on the mirror, I can’t work out the timeline. It says it’s an hour later and shows them packing up out of drag. They write on the mirror and get the Tv message off RuPaul. Then they leave, still out of drag and get in the van saying that this could be their return. Even Akeria does this, but then decides that she doesn’t want to return for the lipsync. So I can’t figure out when the lipsync fits in. With Eureka, she doesn’t get out of drag and goes straight into the lipsync.
that’s a nice ass sewing studio 😍😍
Papacito 😘
All Stars 8 premieres next and will play through the summer. An announcement should be coming soon.
We have coming up España S3, Down Under S3, All Stars S8, UK S5, UKvsTheWorld S2, Philippines S2, France S2, Mexico S1, Canada S4.
Currently, we've got Belgium and Sweden. Pretty sure next up is Spain, followed by Down Under and UK then Canada, which brings us to around the end of fall. All-Stars should drop this summer :)
There is always Drag Race Sverige with the great Admira Thunderpussy.
Belgique finished up today but there’s still a few weeks of Sverige and España s3 is starting in like 10 days.
Thailand 3 please
Just waiting for an announcement and a premiere date!
Where are y’all watching the UK versions?!

Belgium’s finale is tonight so we’ll only have Sweden for a lil bit 😭
PH finished filming recently + UK v the World 2 as well. So much drag race, I love it!!
I love Admira Thunderpussy soooo fucking much.

I'm jonesing already. Thank god I can watch reruns :D
yaaaay!! :)
I just want an announcement / dates
Never heard of it! I’m in the US - I should’ve mentioned that. I’ll check it out!! Thank you! 🫶🏼
You’re welcome! I’m excited for you to watch all the drag race franchises that on there. So many!!! It’s around $4-5 a month I think but totally worth it.
Wear whatever makes you feel comfortable. From photos people posted from previous shows, some go very casual, some very dressed up.  I would say that if you do choose to be in drag, just be mindful that the people sitting behind you have paid to see the show, not to see you, so maybe avoid giant wigs or towering hats.
People do go in drag in general, there may be some recreations and there may not be.
Every drag show I've been to, I've seen people attending in drag. I've also seen lots of meet & greet photos where the fan is in drag.
Seeing Tayshia Adams and Alyssa Edwards on the same cast is bonkers to me honestly
Oh she is going to win
Ugh. I was hoping this was The Traitors season 2.
Love u Alyssa but I love Da’vonne more
I dunno, Kristen Doute is a detective and a crazy person. The others may not have a shot.
Me toooo :(  Would even make sense with Reza getting a second chance.
