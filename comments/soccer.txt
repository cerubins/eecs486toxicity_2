Unhinged Klopp is the best Klopp
Reading the headline, I was imagining Klopp with his flared nostrils and angry eyes
But, did Ancelotti considering returning to Chelsea?
lol
Imagine that. Two ex-Everton managers in a row.
I doubt he'd want to return, but he was my favorite manager of the Roman era and we'd be extremely lucky to have him.
thought he said he's done after real madrid and he'll only do national teams if that
Imagine Ancelotti… who likes to use 16 players all year… gets to manager a squad the size of Chelsea’s
imagine if this happens
How long until Avram Grant is back into the fold?
Is Ruud Gullit not available?
They are gonna get Hiddink out of retirement at this rate
He is either at RM or moving on to Brazil
Might as well try Di Matteo, again.
The Chelsea kit in his first season was sick as hell. I wanted to buy it when they played us in the UCL that year (I bought it a few years ago)
Yeah...for the second leg of UCL 1/4s
Dyche at Chelsea is gonna be lit
He’s definitely one of the best managers if you want to bring the best out of attackers
Wouldn’t be his worst career choice
They could always get Ranieri
Continue his streak of scoring 3 goals are more in England
He’d keep ‘em up !

Bruddah says he trusts refs in first line then rips them apart
Casemiro is making up for all the red cards he never got in La Liga
Ten hag literally saying “you dont know ball if you disagree” 🤣🤣🤣
he's cooked if he thinks those werent reds
>you know it is not a red card because you can send off players in every game in the Premier League.  Last I checked players weren't grabbing eachothers necks in every premier league match
He's truly delusional
No way that tackle that nearly shattered that guy's leg into a million pieces was a red!  On another day probably not even a yellow
Pipe down you bald twat. Both were proper reds you tit.
“Thats Not a red card” of course until it’s someone from the opposite team
Let’s normalize choking our opponents by just giving that a yellow EtH lmao.
Eric Ten Whines.
You could maybe argue the choking incident was blown out of proportion, but I cannot begin to put into words how stonewall the red at Southampton was. Absolutely textbook, and unequivocally the correct decision.
there was the thread of La Liga having 100 more red cards than PL and suddenly Casemiro gets two soft ones.. Has anyone gotten 8 games for so little?
Choking one was an obvious red but I think the second should not have been a red tbf, unlucky for his leg to have rolled over the ball.
If its not then they could have appealed and overturned.
Did 7 hag ever play at the top level tho?
Same energy as saying no offence but you are shit
Frank Lampard classic.  I trust the ref but seriously the refs are shit.
Did he really rip them? He just said that neither incident should’ve been a red, which is facts
That's how true trust works
Second yellows /s
By his logic shouldnt the refs give more red cards for less hard fouls and more open play?!
He grabbed him by the collar
Collar = Neck   Interesting   Edit: sorry, no facts allowed
Lol yeah they do
And arrogant, the United way
*Nearly*  Then you get scissor tackles and it literally cripples a player, not nearly
Choking lol   Don’t be so dramatic
He held him by the collar and tried to stop him from joining in the altercation. They actually shared a chuckle few seconds later while Casimero's hand were still on his collars.
How can you choke someone holding them by their collar?
"7 hag".... elite banter that
Yes
won more than Arsenal has in the last decades also came a lot closer to winning the CL
I trust the refs but those weren't reds
Oh boy here we go again
-arsenal fan
Said he will end Liverpool and City's dynasties, proceeded to get slapped up by both.
It was on video, the angles showed it, but that's the issue.  The angle showed to the ref on field was damning, not the angle that clearly showed Casemiro wasn't choking anyone.
Bro even teams in the bottom half of the table are coming for us 😪
"An era can come to an end"  Doesnt exactly sound like him saying he WILL end their era HIMSELF does it...
I'd rather watch this United play than be in a relegation battle after spending 600 million in the market. Just saying.
I mean to be fair how’s Liverpool’s “dynasty” going?

[This Argentina flag has seen some shit](https://i.imgur.com/J4ZyibT.jpg)
I always thought Deschamps was like 70 but he was 29 during the 98 World Cup, 32 when he retired and took over Monaco, 35 when he went to the finals with them, 44 when he took the France job and 49 when they won the World Cup.  I'm exaggerating but still when I first found out he was on the French team at the 98 world cup I assumed he was an old player who already used up his last legs that  they only brought along for leadership.
[I fucking called it lol](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/12c7ns9/daily_discussion/jf0mimg/?context=5)  Side note: how hard is it to learn Arabic? Asking for a Belgian friend who’s name rhymes with cock
Anyone else feel like mangers are much more easily forgotten in history? At least before the 90’s or so. I can tell you who were the best players in every decade since the 50’s and what each of those players achieved, but I really can’t tell you about many managers before the 90’s. I’d be hard pressed to answer who managed most European Cup (UCL equivalent) champions or World Cup winners before that
Tevez’ stint at ManU was a 2 year loan!?!?
Zagallo is the most forgotten legend ever. The only person with 4 world cup trophies (two as a player and two as a coach) and he lost the 98 final. Would have been 5 if Ronaldo was healthy in that game
Every single thread on here is dictated by the opinions of the first 5 or so people that comment on that thread.  Worst quirk of reddit imo
It feels like Napoli hasn’t quite returned from the international break yet.
Transfermarkt lists Marcelo as Madrid's eighth most capped player, but Wikipedia doesn't list him in the top ten. Which one is more accurate and what's the reason for the discrepancy?
1987 has to be the year that with most world class players born in it.   Messi, Suarez, Benzema, Cavani, Pique, Fabregas, Bonucci.   Just to name a few.
PES with the Champions League licensing did far more than what FIFA did with it. Aside from the better integration, they also had absolute **BANGERS** like [this](https://youtu.be/ISY6P0jg6ME) version of the CL theme, which is like final boss music and IMO is just as good as the original.
Hans-Dieter Flick is approaching Roberto Di Matteo levels of fraud status tbh
Do you think Chelsea still had a whole heap of gear lying around with FL on it from last time, or did they have to buy heaps of new shit?
All these Messi PSG statements are weird, Mbappe has been flirting with Madrid for half a decade now, Neymar wants to go back to Barca came in every window till 2019, of course Messi will take the chance to go back to Barca  And honestly I don't see him actively not giving effort when playing, walking is a part of his gameplay to conserve energy which has kept him fit for so many games and seasons, it's not like he stops the play and throws up his hands when he doesn't get the expected pass, etc..... other than that whenever he gets the ball on his feet he is the usual Messi, just 35, now if you midfield is so incredibly mediocre that it can't give the ball to neither Messi not Mbappe in the final 3rd then it's not their problem
Grinding out 1-0 or 2-1 wins at the end of the year, while playing like shit, is a hallmark of any title winning team
Seems like a dumb question, but why did uefa/fifa allow the four nations of the UK even though they are not independent? Having regions of a country compete as individuals is actually really strange when I think about it.
 I still wonder as to why Enzo Fernandez decided moving to Chelsea was a good idea. It absolutely befuddles me.  Just look at his career. After being a wonder boy at River Plate, he has the possibility to go to Europe, and makes the good decision to move to Benfica. With some European clubs in for him, he chooses the right club that will give him lots of playing time and help foster his development into Europe.  He wastes no time and does amazing, helping Benfica push for the title and qualify first in their CL group, ahead of PSG and Juventus. His decision to go to Benfica was a great one, as his playing time and ability to seamlessly enter their squad helps the decision to bring him to the World Cup.  The World Cup comes around, and he absolutely smashes it when given the chance to play. He deservedly wins the Young Player of the Tournament and ends up winning the most prized competition. At this point, he certainly has a bright future ahead in club football.  Coming back to Benfica, where the club is doing well, has an easy RO16 opponent, and where he has been for 6 months. And he decides that the very first club that is willing to buy him, Chelsea, is where he wants to go. He feels the need to leave ASAP, to where it almost seems like he dislikes Benfica. Even when Benfica have an option to sign for Chelsea in the summer with the exact same 8 year contract to set him up for life, he still somehow thinks he needs to go to Chelsea right there. Chelsea were in a rough battle for a European spot, let alone a CL place. Enzo also was all but guaranteed to go to any club he’d like in the summer, as his quality was obvious, and Benfica are literally always willing to sell their young talents. And now, Benfica are still doing well as favorites for the title, and a genuinely possible chance to make the CL final. Chelsea’s manager is already gone and even making any European competition looks very tough.  Throughout all this, I really cannot believe why Enzo didn’t wait. Money? He’s basically guaranteed to get big contracts and a big career in the future. He also could have signed the deal with Chelsea and yet still just finish the season, or wait until the summer. Did he think Chelsea were guaranteed to qualify for CL and felt they would have a better season than Benfica? Did he just hate living in Lisbon?   Of course, there is still a lot of time for him to have success at Chelsea, but if not, he’ll of course try and push his way out like he did at Benfica. Plus there’s the fact that his move may end up hampering his ability if he doesn’t get a functional team in place. Ultimately though, I’d just love to know what Enzo was actually thinking when he made that move, and what he’s thinking now.
Somebody said there is no poverty in his skills in regards to Ronaldinho son’s comp. Is it true that Brazil’s talent has declined as poverty has declined?
Saying this again.   Bellingham to Madrid was just a fan fiction created by some journos and then fans started riding on it. There are some journos tweeting stuff and then pages like Madrid zone keep chugging on it for days.   No way he is coming to Madrid. And he shouldn't !!  These are the same people who were also linking Haaland to Madrid and then City move happened.  Madrid won't break the bank for these players, unless its Mbappe (even for him that looks unlikely, but never know with Perez).
Looking back, I find it incredible how Heskey never filed a lawsuit against KSI back in the early 2010s when KSI consistently called him a rapist
Start, bench, sell:  Pedri, Camavinga, Gavi

Anyone else have absolutely no idea Umtiti was at Lecce?
2024 Copa America Final  between Bolivia vs Venezuela is gonna be lit!
Michael Santos just scored a fantastic goal for Talleres hes been great so far. Barracas is just a poor side with cool kits  and another from Ramon Sosa whos been great
Luciano Rodriguez looks elite everytime he's on the ball he's ready to play for Uruguay. He almost scored a free kick last night in his Libertadores debut. I could see Manchester United, Chelsea, Barcelona, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, and Atletico Madrid going after him this summer. Bielsa has a nice squad for Copa America next year
I missed the Mbappe drama. Anyone have a tldr?
River plate fans how has Demichelis been so far?
You think we'll ever see someone complete football at club and national level twice as a player or complete football as a player then as a manager? And which one would be more impressive?

That sun looks like he spent three straight weeks in a damp bunker on a bleak South Atlantic island, scarcely fending off Royal Marine assaults by day and getting cluster-bombed by Harrier jets all night.
It’s very interesting how people age differently. Like Zidane is just 4 years younger than Deschamps but looks virtually the same as when he retired. Ancelotti has also looked 70 since he turned 50 years old
Yeah he aged terribly. Look at Gary Lineker now, you wouldn't think he's 62
He’s only 10 years older than Scaloni, goddamn that is wild.
It’s very difficult for someone with no Arabic background at all
Origi is awful, I’m actually shocked at how trash he is
probably due to the game being less tactically developed or due to us just not going so deep into the stats as we do now.
Because of third party ownership it was a really weird transfer that I still don't quite understand. From what I do understand Tevez was under joint ownership from West Ham and MSI (Media Sport investment.)  MSI were a third party ownership group who wanted the transfer from West Ham to United to go through but West Ham didn't think the fee was high enough until West Ham and MSI reached an agreement. I've seen Wikipedia list it as a loan from West Ham although it felt more like a loan from MSI.
Also think once something has a few downvotes it is destined to be downvoted to oblivion just because people mindlessly pile on. Catch myself doing it sometimes
I don't know which is more accurate, but most likely one source is counting back further than the other, i.e. including guys who played a million games in the 30s & 40s etc.
Bonucci?? World class  Good defender, but worldclass is overused here
You hit me right in the nostalgia. PES 2011 is the game that made me start to like football.
Tbf, [EA got fucking Hans Zimmer to compose a version of the CL theme for them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guM36bF-qF0)
Let’s wait until the Euros. But I do think he may end up being a one hit wonder at this point. No real excuse to not qualify past the group with Germany
he was already a fraud when he got knocked out by Pochs psg
It’s Chelsea. They probably have gear with every combination of letters there just in case.
Maybe Lampard still had all the gear and it was the reason they hired him. They could save money on new gear.
Yep I don’t care that he doesn’t run, he’s not worth playing if you just make him press. I admit to being a Messi fanboy but it really pisses me off how he’s constantly criticized for “not showing effort” because he walks. He’s been doing that for years because that’s the way to get the best out of him. Make Mbappe do some pressing if it’s so important
Rothen is an idiot. like him and Riolo have the worst psg opinions
1-0s with goals around the 40’ or 60’ are simultaneously the worst and best football games there are
Football history probably has something to do with it. With England vs Scotland being the first ever FIFA recognised international game in 1872. It'd have been a lot easier to say no to an attempt to separate had they started as a UK team, than to convince them to integrate when they were already separate entities with separate FAs and separate official league football systems.
We're not regions of a country, we're countries in a union.  But anyway, England & Scotland were the countries to play international football so it predates UEFA/FIFA. And it's how we've all competed since.   We are treated as distinct countries in a lot of sports (Football, Rugby, Cricket etc), but compete as GB in things like the Olympics.
He secured generational wealth and has more than proven he can excel in the Prem. He fucked over Benfica for sure but if you are Enzo and are only focused on what’s best for you and your family, his choices make sense. Except for getting the number for Reece’s hairdresser.
We love him at Chelsea but Im suprised he came here as well. Could have waited and end up at Real Madrid
Cuz he’s proper Chels
Knowing how several players have done it in the past, I wouldn't be shocked if Chelsea paying the full 120M clause played a role. That made him River's biggest ever sale by FAR with the 25% fee, and he's a River lad through and through. Not enough to make the choice by itself, but surely played a role, especially with how he left in a sour note (leaving because of an elimination in which he played poorly)   Gonzalo Martinez also went to a worse team because they paid River more, players like Julián and Montiel renewed just so the club would get fees, Borré negotiated extra signing fees and donated it all to River as "payment" for leaving on a Bosman... It's happened a lot before
The reason why many Brazilian footballers come from poverty is because football is their only option. They have to make it work for themselves and for their families. It's not poverty that makes them better, it's just that someone with the same talent and a wealthy family is more likely to choose a different career.
“there is no poverty in his skills” sounds like some fire shit my grandpa would say about anyone on the 2022 World Cup squad, regardless of how true it is.
Poverty has declined?
that exact same order
In that order.
pedri  gavi  camavinga
I think the point of people saying that is that a player is never more important than the club. In that a decision/action that benefits the club more should always be made over a decision/action that benefits a player, regardless of how good he is. You can be better, and have better prospects, than the club you play for, but if having you becomes more of a problem than it's worth, you can fuck off. Obviously there are some players that are more famous and successful than some clubs
Yes obviously, it's for the sake of professionalism and respect, Ronaldo is bigger than the entire Saudi League, Messi has more CLs and League titles than PSG, same for Ramos, it's not that unrealistic in practicality
Never for the fans.
they absolutely can, don’t say it out loud but I can genuinely can’t think of any relevant metric in which you can claim Messi isn’t bigger than PSG on Ronaldo bigger than al nassr
Obviously they can. They shouldn’t be bigger than the club they play at generally speaking (it’s okay for old players)
example: messi and PSG
Fans of that club would never agree to this, that’s the point.
>with cool kits  they’re unbelievably generic, what’s cool about them?
PSG featured him in a video they put out to promote season tickets for next season. Mbappe didn’t like that since they never spoke to him about it and he’s sick of being treated (edit: portrayed would’ve been a better choice of words) like he’s above his teammates and the club so he had a moan about it on social media. Both parties have since spoke and the matter’s been dealt with.   That’s pretty much it.
Mbappe reminded Nasser who’s boss
Honestly I'm pretty happy with him so far. River Plate is currently 1st in the league and we not only didn't lose but we didn't even concede a single goal for the entirety of March, which was great.  We lost the opening game of the Copa Libertadores group stage the other day 1- 3, which is not great, but it was in La Paz (Bolivia) in a stadium that sits at 3500 meters above sea level, which makes it extremely hard for a lot of players because the air is incredibly thin. Our starting CF said after the game he felt dizzy the whole time. In fact we haven't won a game there since like 1970, so shitting on him for that would be exaggerated in my opinion.  He is clearly very serious and professional which I like and goes along very well with the club philosophy. His next challenges right now are the upcoming Copa Libertadores games, we should realistically win both games against Sporting Cristal (Peru), the home game against The Strongest (the Bolivian team against which we lost the away game in La Paz), and the home game against Fluminense (Brazil). The away game against Fluminense would be excellent and I think it's doable, but certainly hard.  Apart from that, he's going to be getting a ton of pressure from fans and the press to make Claudio Echeverri debut for the first team. He's a 17 year old kid from the academy who's currently putting an otherwordly performance at the u17 South American Championship, arguably the biggest promise in years. They were planning on his debut to be in the second half of the year, but after this we have to accept he's probably not going to last long at all at the club so he should make his professional debut ASAP. If he leaves without having played a single minute of professional football at River Plate it would be unacceptable.
Not a river fan but personally wouldn’t mind him staying for a while
> complete football as a player then as a manager  Pretty sure Beckenbauer did this.
Zidane literally completed football both as a player and as a manager. He is the actual epitome of what you’re talking about.
What do you mean by complete football?
xavi will
Based on this season, really really high
probably the best midfielder, actually no, best player football has ever seen
Absolutely awful player, get him out of my club asap
game was gone
Isn’t that that why comment scores are hidden for awhile? It doesn’t seem to stop that.
He was definitely world class for a good handfull of seasons with Juve when they had him, Chiellini and Barzagli. I’d even argue he was their best defender from 2016-2018
Hans Zimmer’s EL anthem was my pregame for so long in high school
His work at Bayern was still miles better than Di Matteo at Chelsea.
Do psg fans even like Rothen?
Also to note, the UK and GB are different  United Kingdom - England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland  Great Britain - England, Scotland and Wales
The wealth argument doesn’t make much sense to me because Benfica president Rui Costa said he could have signed for literally the same offer and still just finish the season with Benfica. And besides he was basically guaranteed generational wealth anyways, clubs would be begging to sign him in the summer, and he could go for the highest bidder if he wanted
Idk, I am just assuming shit. I don’t know shit about Brazil’s standard of living in the past decade
I agree
I liked the black out logo and last years kit with the map on it
Does he have some sort of use by use veto power for likeness rights clause in his contract? I though just a license for use (maybe w/n certain parameters) was the standard but I can definitely see him having the leverage to negotiate elsewise.
Thanks.
Thank you for the detailed reply
He's the closest but he never won the champions league or Euros as a manager. Deschamps too, he lost in the 2004 champions league and 2016 Euro's finals
Winning all the major trophies at club and international level. For example if Argentina had won the 2014 world cup and one of the shootouts against Chile then Messi would have completed football twice because he would have at least two of everything
Oh yeah that’s not in question, Flick was a big reason why Bayern won the sextuple, and Chelsea might as well not have had a manager when they won their CL. I am curious as to how his career will go if he ends up failing at the Euros again. At that point it would be a huge embarrassment
only the racists that hate south americans
So when Great Britain is the figure in said sport, who would Northern Irish people be allowed to represent? Do they join GB or Ireland? I dont know much ab this topic
I’m not sure who owns his image rights tbh. Plenty of players are happy enough to sign over their image rights to their clubs but I wouldn’t be surprised if he has kept a percentage (or all) of his looking at how favourable other terms of his contract seems to be.
From Google   >Officially, the team is the "Great Britain and Northern Ireland Olympic Team", although athletes from Northern Ireland may opt to compete under the auspices of the Olympic Federation of Ireland instead.  So I'm not sure why we aren't just called United Kingdom for the Olympics if it's Great Britain and Northern Ireland?  I've confused myself now  Looks like the Olympic committee classifies Northern Ireland as Great Britain (even though that isn't true)  Someone from Northern Ireland can compete for Great Britain or Ireland
>  I dont know much ab this topic  They should join Ireland.
Thanks, it’s definitely really odd that

I reckon he should do commentary from the tactical box
"Haha, but no seriously, we're getting smashed by Madrid."
I get it Frank. Anything to get away from Fletch
The season is whatever at this point but I cant wait to see him take another 193 drinks from his water bottle per half again
Just imagine if good old frank wins the UCL with Chelsea just like Di Matteo lmao
Frank Lampard and how to fail upwards in your managerial career. He should follow Southgate after this stint with chelsea.
Lampard starting to take on the look of Nate from Ted Lasso, the darling appointed to a top team with no legitimate qualifications. Unlike Nate, Frank will win fuck all and nit take Chelsea anywhere uowards before he leaves at the end if the year.
At least the plane ticket isn't going to waste :D... but no seriously, being back in the commentary box was a humiliating reflection of the trajectory of my managerial career and I'm immensely relieved to be able to get out of it :|
How high can he raise his eyebrows? That will definitely determine the match.
Shame really, I'd have liked to hear him on commentary. He'd make a better partner for Fletcher than Steve Mcmanaman
I can imagine the face lol he goes 0-100 so quickly.
I just wish that tiny percent chance of Chelsea winning against real Madrid because could you imagine a team being 11th in the prem and being in the semi final of the champions league .
I love shitting on the English as much as anyone, however, Southgate "inherited" a team which was an absolute laughing stock. He may not be a "champion" (TM) coach, but he sure as hell did a great job in taking them from point a (spoiled, pampered, divas) to the competitive position you are in now.  Irrespective of the results, he's turned the programme around from it's "hollywood"/absolute banter era.
To be fair, Nate will win fuck all too!
Except Frank actually managed Chelsea before too. Lol.
Sadly he can only raise both at the same time, just doesn’t look as good
And then, back to 0.
villarreal was like 9th and somehow beat bayern munich last season   cause how the fuck
Frankfurt won the Europa League while being like 13th in the bundesliga
The problem is that Chelsea is not like a Palace, that is to say a perennial middle of the table team, they’ve obviously massively underperformed, and they are a true nightmare to face in the champions.   This is why I don’t like them, whenever they are massively underperforming like this and you don’t know where to put them, they’re incredibly dangerous. Truly a bizarre team that always in a ‘rebuilding’ phase. I don’t trust them lmao
You make Chelsea sound like it will be a walk over. I reckon it will be very close. With Potter it was already over but now they have a fighting chance.
Uhm he also then was gifted one of the better generations of English players in a while no?
I was only joking, yeah he signed an extension and isn't really going anywhere until the next big tournament at least that is the Euros, he has to win that I feel otherwise what's the point.   English Fa does have a thing of getting only English managers in for the job so I wouldn't be surprised post Southgate one of Gerrard or Lampard get the job, most likely will be Potter depending upon if he is in a club by then.  Edit - lol why the downvotes just stating some facts here, English FA is not going to hire a manager outside of England.
This explains the lack of control in the teams he coaches. If he could control one eyebrow at a time that would make him a tactical mastermind.
Lol true. The transition is too quick.
And real got absolutely hammered by Ajax in 2019.. Everything is possible and Kante is back.
Came real close to making the final as well.
Villarreal was playing excellent football though, just missing finishing their chances and having a mental block at the end of games, conceding late goals or equalisers.  Is that the same at Chelsea? Sometimes the results can hide the nuances.
tbf its easy to trash barcelona at their own stadium wearing white
Famous Englishman Sven Goran Erickson come on down ;)
Sad but true, one eyebrow shows control, both creates uncertainty, it’s why his defences are leaky
Since when?
That was in the early 2000s I am talking about this era of English FA. Post world cup all the talks of the next English manager was about getting in an English  coach. They might even promote from within.
Yup same for Klopp he can't control his mouth it hangs open whenever Liverpool concede these days. These managers need facial lessons.

Indeed. Venezuela will almost certainly end up third, so Brazil vs Venezuela in the first round.

Vincent Kompany has definitely proven that he’s a capable manager. I hope they can survive and avoid relegation the Prem next season
Another bald one joins the premier league
Even as a Liverpool fan, Kompany seems like a genuinely fantastic bloke. I'm happy for Burnley and how they've done. Welcome back to the PL Vincent!
Here’s to you, Vincent Kompany!
Get in Burnley. Great club, great fans (minus a few notable exceptions). You belong in the top flight.
Proud of you, Cap
Kompany is the real fucking deal. Man, what a season! Hope he doesn't go to a small club like Chelsea
I'm not celebrating Burnley but I'm celebrating Burnley that doesn't break your players legs half the time.
They're getting relegated after one season in the Prem anyway
It’s possible that all 3 promoted teams survive relegation this season and Burnley just clinched promotion with 7(?) matches left. Not sure how you can jump to that conclusion.
How did they already get promoted if they have 6 matches left to play?
It's going to be easy if there are as many shit teams in the Prem as there are this season
Fair-play to him for becoming a PL manager so quickly
Don't see why they'd go for Kompany when they've already got a City legend
Complete myth btw.  Burnley didn't cause any more injuries than the average PL team across our 8 years in the prem (and actually came in the top half in the fair play league in 6/8 of those seasons).  Keep believing it if you want to though 👍
🤡
Look at points
I think it's a bit of a myth that there are so many bad teams this season tbh. Part of the reason Burnley have set the record for earliest promotion is because the top half of the championship is poor this season. It's why clubs that have players that yourself and Leicester have are in genuine trouble this season and it's why there isn't a Huddersfield/Cardiff/Sheffield United types of club that are cut adrift at the bottom of the premier league.
Bare in mind we committed almost half the fouls and got half the cards of Arsenal about six seasons in a row.
and much less violent than Stoke during same period
It’s probably also that the top 1/4 or 1/3 or so is so damn good, too. The rest of the Prem just didn’t look like it’s on the same level even if it’s still very good football.

His record against **Braga**: **8W, 4D & 5L in 17 games**, meaning that Braga has beaten Sérgio Conceição's Porto more times than Benfica and Sporting combined.  He actually won his first 5 games against Braga, but it seems that they have become a lot harder to beat.
He’s a very good coach. Shameful performances from Benfica that have gone too long
Arguably the best portuguese coach in the last 5/6 years
All my homies know benfica is shit
Says "it's on the club" when asked the question, so he probably wouldn't mind staying if the club wanted him to
Club legend, will never forget those 2 goals against the Rovers. Will love nothing more than to see him hoist the trophy
The feeling of dread around Burnley's promotion eases very slightly.
It's hard to really state how much of an icon Ashley Barnes is.  Half a million paid back and then some for a guy who showed up in big matches. And despite having an abysmal turn of form in 2022, just came out and became a regular starter again out of the blue in a system that was so different to what we expect of Barnes. It came as a pleasant surprise.  Bare in mind he's out of contract and most likely not getting an extension. So chances are he'll be gone due to age and limited play time as Kompany will be looking towards Lyle Foster (potentially Jay Rodriguez, Michael Obafemi or worst case scenario Wout Weghorst) in the future
Everton move confirmed.
Could see him moving on. This is a great accomplishment for him
+10 to Man City's GD at the start of next season and save everyone some time
Cunt
6 months short of a testimonial (not that they do those anymore) but devastating all the same.
Wait, didn’t they just get promoted?
Well...damn
Just signed Foster and obafemi, jay Rodriguez has one more year on his contract. I would love nothing more than Barnes getting another year but if kompany wants another striker it makes no sense keeping Barnes on with 4 other strikers as painful as it is
> will be looking towards Lyle Foster (potentially Jay Rodriguez, Michael Obafemi or worst case scenario Wout Weghorst) in the future  No offense to that group, but would not be surprised at all to you see buy another proper starting striker in the summer with the PL money. Maybe Foster or Obafemi break out but that’s a lot of faith to put your PL hopes and dreams onto.
Never forgive him for that ‘challenge’ on Matic.
Right, why did they stop these? I think many great players deserve them and don't get them anymore
Is it a formal limit of 10 years as a requirement for testimonials or onto discretion of clubs?

How long is that guy going to be making sick saves for? Feels like Kameni.
I watch him every 4 years in the WC, so I know what I am talking about....he does this very often and it doesn't seem to me out of character, haha. Unreal save.
He's getting so much hate from the national team.
Someone tell him this is not the world cup
On another note, how the hell did Lukaku miss that
Unreal save
didnt realize the world cup was back on
Practicing for the next world cup
Yep...that's Memo Ochoa
Classic Ted Mosby
I’ll miss Ochoa memes in 2026. He’s been one of my favorite players to watch in last 4.
My man is starting in 2026, fight me
Acevedo better
Unironically this save costed Inter 2 points since Salernitana ended up drawing with a last minute goal from Candreva
Classic Shmosby
Ironically Kameni kept Ochoa on the bench when they played together at Malaga years ago
I signed him in FM05, and he was pretty established as a player already at that point I believe.
Man, Kameni always showed up against us and Barca. And Diego Alves too
Why do some guys play so well for country but are just average for a club? Lookin at you Pickford!
Chile once won  7-0 over Mexico with Ochoa as the goalkeeper
Probably because seeing the carcass of Jimenez at the World Cup permanently scarred them.  They’re afraid of seeing a repeat of someone who overextended their stay. Whether that’s justified or not, is an entirely different question but you can’t hardly blame them for feeling that way.
shhhh
Lukaku is a big boy with big brain, and his big brain moves are beyond our understanding.
Ball on the bounce while nearly crawling, that's not an easy header to keep down.
I swear he hit the crossbar in a recent game as well from like 5 yards out. I don’t watch many inter games but is this a regular occurrence for him?
You know, I've said that phrase way too many times these past two months. Being an Inter fan has been a painful experience as of late.
Classic shmosby
Talking as if he will not be our GK in 2026 and do the same saves as always lmao
What do you mean miss? He wants to play the 2026 wc
Hmmm, Maybe... but it's San Memos position to lose atm
That wasn't a goal was a middle finger from God himself to all inter fans
I used to watch Ochoa when he played in the Mexican league in 2006. He was amazing back then, it's kind of crazy to see him still doing it.
Pickford has been Everton’s best player for two years now. I know that’s not saying much, but he hasn’t had a proper clanger for a while.
He's been amazing for Salernitana  Best GK in Serie A since the restart
He hasn't been average at all for Salernitana. He's stopping everything
He wasn’t average at America and Ajaccio.
Pickford is a strange choice. The obvious answer is Richarlison
Anyone who says Ochoa is only good for country, and not club is someone who doesn't know anything about his career. He was world class when I used to watch him play for club America in 2006. He has aged, so he isn't as good as he once was.
Klose
~~South~~ Latin Americans don’t mess around when it comes to their NTs
Pickford's not as good for England as you're making it seem though. He performs decently but he's far from unbeatable with the NT either. Their great defensive record is way more related to their defensive setup than him as a goalkeeper.
That wasn't a wc though
Well he didn’t start playing regularly until last month. But missing sitters has been a semi regular thing since. Missed one I probably could’ve finished against Fiorentina, and I haven’t played a game of footy in years.
Ya its common but he is starting over Lautaro and Dzeko because he creates more chances for the team. He holds up ball quite well. Lautaro finising been as bad as Lukaku post wc and he was bad there too.
I agree but if he was good as he was for country he wouldn’t be playing at Everton.
When did he go back to Europe? I thought he in America
Well Ochoa ain't south American
Again I think he has been. Spurs are one club that have been interested, and if Everton go down he’s probably the first to leave.
Since the restart. Left America after the WC.
Yep, Latin is what I meant, my bad.
Ohhh

Rooting for them to win the league. It would be an even bigger upset than Lille winning it 2 seasons back.
Farmers league🐖
With PSG in this kinda form you never know.
Is everything a farmers league except for the premier league. Are you guys going to start calling the champions league a farmers league as well
I think most PL fan consider their league title more prestigious than UCL, so you are right in some way
I think it depends on the club. Liverpool during their 30 year drought probably wouldve wanted league success more than European success. However man city man United and maybe arsenal fans(not sure about them) would probably prefer European success. Man city and Arsenal because they never won the CL and Man united because they won the league too many times and the CL not enough times for a team of their magnitude
I didn't say more important but more presitigious, I agree then it depends on the clubs

Including Sevillas red card today La Liga has seen 108 red cards. Premier League has seen 28 this season, Ligue 1 with 84,  Serie A has seen 50, and Bundesliga 33.
Prem refs are far too reluctant to give red cards, seen Romero drag Cucurella down by his hair, seen players go in for leg breakers and get away with it.
I’m curious what the numbers are for injuries that have occurred for both leagues this season.
Casemiro would like to know how he is getting a La Liga treatment he perpetually avoided while he was there.  But the problem isn't La Liga. It's the EPL. Always been entirely too physical a league. Refs say, "We don't want to decide a game." But not carding blatantly cynical and reckless challenges decides games too.
Mateu Lahoz exists
Worst refereed season in PL history is what's going on. Refs do so little and there's no consistency in the little they do.
There should've been way more reds than 28 this season. All kinds of bullshit doesn't get called. They've instituted new rules this season to ensure that the game flows better, but it's resulted in a lot of blatant bullshit not being called.
Most of the red cards justified based on the rules. Nobody wants to see their team getting red cards and everyone prefers to win against 11 but 10, but if it's a yellow/red card then the ref must sanction it accordingly rather than think about overall red card stats
Refs outside the Prem book more and give more reds fs but at the same time LaLiga is the league with the most kicks and such
Only like 97 of those are Savic heh
It's not football, it's La Liga. Pure butchers play here
This is what happens when both teams bribe the refs to send the opposition off - double the cards, twice the money! #refswinningforonce
Yes you're playing in a league with refs on a power trip.
La liga is refereed for midgets who dive. Premier league refs realize contact is part of football and reds should only be given as a last resort. Makes for better watching too.
I'll see you next week!  Edit: for real. No offense intended, don't ban me
He's right... Prem should have 100 reds
In PL you’re allowed to break opponents ankles in the first 10 mins   No such thing as early red
How many of the 108 cards come from lahoz?
It's true. La Liga refs blow their whistle far too often whereas PL refs seemingly refuse to give out cards unless they absolutely have to. Doesn't help that when the feeling of referees are hurt they'll just card you because why not.
I would need to look at the stats but I feel like a lot of PL players have had their careers shortened through sheer attrition because refs are scared to pull out the cards. Guys seem to retire quite early there
Premier league let’s players get away with murder. Cynical challenges, overly physical ones, VAR overturns basically nothing.
Yeah they planned a meeting in like 10 days to talk about refs, FFP, and Barca-gate  https://www.football-espana.net/2023/04/04/la-liga-call-extraordinary-meeting-in-order-to-discuss-referees-and-el-caso-negreira
From the PL games I have seen this season, there should be absolutely more than those 28. In Bundesliga games I haven't seen a missed send off. Bundesliga also has the leadt games from all big leagues and not many butcher teams. La Liga and Ligue 1 seem very extreme in this matter.
Here's an example of a "challenge" that wasn't even given a yellow card or reviewed by var:  https://youtu.be/KuBnNfITGCY   Consistency is terrible.  On top of that, refs in the PL are reluctant to give out cards early on in games for bad fouls which ends up influencing games far more than they would let on.
I often hear Dutch fans saying that the refs are quite good. How many red cards do they have this season? I'd say 50-84 seems reasonable
And with so many red cards, there is still a huge discrepancy on how many reds each team gets. I'm not claiming anything by it, but people have claimed wrong doing in the past based on cards or penalties, why not this time?  https://www.fotmob.com/leagues/87/stats/season/17852/teams/total_red_card_team/laliga-teams
And half of those red cards in the PL were from the Fulham - Man United match
this is so true, it baffles me how PL refs barely ever give out reds in comparison to other leagues. sometimes i find it crazy that they hesitate before giving out yellows too?? i've seen romero get away with so much this season. so many players actually. fabinho, the andy carroll & eriksen incident, and a few others.
Yellows too. If they were stricter with yellows the players would quit that shit and stop the red card offense bullshit cause they'd know the limit.
Physicality isn’t a problem
I was about to say that 🤣
He's not even the worst lmao
It might be badly refereed from your perspective but having the whistle blown less makes for a far more entertaining product and those who actually follow the premier league religiously would tell you that the game is much better now than it was a few years ago
> La liga is refereed for midgets who dive.  It's REALLY not.   See: Eden Hazard and Phil Coutinho
Diving midgets huh.
La Liga also lets refs go off on power trips TBH
all to keep the game flowing and counter attacking constantly, which to the viewer is much better for their attention if they dont have to keep thinking how to break defences and slow pace build up like in la liga
Not sure about that.   It’s just wildly inconsistent.
Fabinho doesn’t even kick footballs anymore just players
Physical! Pace! Power! The English Premier league.
I feel like the prem is very lenient on second yellows. If you are already on a yellow, you have to commit more than a yellow card offence to get a second one which defeats the whole purpose.
Harry Kane still has not got a red card in EPL really baffle me. He made dozen of reckless and stupid tackle
Yet Casemiro has gotten 2 for honestly very little.
Unless your names Casemiro 😆
Yeah, I agree. The situation in La Liga is very bad, but the Prem is basically the other end of the spectrum. From the games that I've seen, the BuLi often manages to strike a very good balance.
Which Barçagate? There’s two. Lol
Eredivisie teams have 33 red cards this season
That was in the FA cup
This is even more the case I think.
Laws of the Game reminder:    Careless is when a player shows a lack of attention or consideration when   making a challenge or acts without precaution. No disciplinary sanction   is needed   • Reckless is when a player acts with disregard to the danger to,   or consequences for, an opponent and must be cautioned   • Using excessive force is when a player exceeds the necessary use of force   and/or endangers the safety of an opponent and must be sent off  &#x200B;  Note the final point. Any force above what is necessary to win a challenge is excessive.
It is when officiated very inconsistently like it is in the prem.
Hmm maybe as a neutral lol
Yeah La Liga refs are at the other end of the scale compared to England, way too happy to blow their whistle. And when it comes to VAR, it feels like they are overly technical and don't use common sense much of the time  But then at the same time they will randomly let players get away with persistent fouling whilst already on a yellow or let leg breaking tackles go despite having VAR. La Liga refs are both too lenient and too soft at the same time somehow  And even though many of them have big egos a desire to be in the spotlight, they don't realise that teams are playing them every week. You can get in their heads and everyone knows it, so it's only logical that teams will look to bully the referee
It's not better for the attention when you're pissed of for half of the time about God awful refereeing.
Cynical challenges are what kills counter-attacks, they don't enable the,
Nah, the Prem has become much worse to watch of late.  Cynical play and honestly what looks like a lot of tired bodies from an insane schedule
He got away with it for years and years in Madrid, it’s about damn time
Just like xhaka, he comes with a reputation, and hence is judged differently by the refrees . You will find that out over the next years...
Front and rear entrance?
Whoops, you’re right.
La Liga fans always say they want less refs going on power trips and more flow to game. In la liga it’s too easy right now to keep fouling to stop the flow of the game. It’s rewarded too much as a form of defending
I am living in Spain and besides el clásico I can’t watch the games because it feels like the game is constantly stopped. Feels like the American football sometimes
La Liga fans aren't pissed about refeering? It's just odd to me how La Liga fans moan about referees who are too involved like every week, until a La Liga player says the same thing, and suddenly there's La Liga fans popping out of the woodwork about how actually they prefer La Liga referees.
what is this tired bodies you speak of?
Well true but I would argue both of these aren't Red card worthy compared to the shit ref lets go in other matches
I agree with you. Refereeing in Spain is really poor
How's it rewarded when you have 100+ red cards? Isn't that the opposite of the point everyone is making?
No one ever says they prefer Spanish refers
What exactly are your post, and the others in the chain, doing then if not implying that other leagues are too lax about fouls  in comparison to La Liga? It certainly reads as at least somewhat of a defense of La Liga ref.  Also this is just straight up a defense, so you're just factually wrong that no one is defending them. https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/12f1ehw/marca_sevillas_fernando_laliga_is_one_of_the_best/jfdq4l4?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button
Didn't mention that they preferred Spanish refs though.
This semantic game you're trying to pull is so dumb. "No one is saying La Liga refs are better! Their cards are just justified and other league's refs make bad decisions! But no one is saying we think they're better!"
Where do you get that from haha
Your comprehensive skills are lacking.
1 billion release clause incoming
Sign this man to a forever contract, please and thank you
As they should, the guy's a revelation
His development in 2023 has been rapid, great to see
Makes sense, considering he is nothing short of amazing. Happy to witness the beginnings of his legacy, it will be a valuable memory in the future.
If they're so happy with him then why do they keep selling him for cheap to me on Fifa?   ^/s
Remember when he was the one struggling and Tchoumeni doing well and nonsense articles about how Camavinga was a flop. Now the tables have turned.
Boehly-esq contract please
World class
He's been good, people acting like he's been the second coming of Christ confuse me a bit. Hopefully we get to see him in midfield and not as makeshift solution for other spots.
I mean why wouldn’t they be happy with him.  He’s a quality LB who can deputise in midfield
He’s my favorite player to watch right now. Just has massive impact on the field.
You know what? Make that 2 billion. With Todd Boehly, you don't know what that yank will do
Thats a terrible idea lol
Called it a while ago, getting him for 30m is going to be the best midfielder signing in recent memory
He was very important in the CL knockouts, changed a lot of games as a sub.  But he’s become much more consistent.
Both are world class, very jealous of the RM pull lol
He is really good, it pisses me off how good he is. He annoys me more than any other madrid player
Well he might as well be the second coming of Jesús christ. He's been insane after the world cup. Carrying the midfield at times.
You take the 1 billion then...
I’d take that 1 billion and build a second Santiago Bernadette next to our current one.
Bros getting downvotes when we’ve all seen what happens to players if you give them long term contracts with exorbitant salaries
Why?
Was obvious at the time. I've never seen a 17 year old midfielder play the way he did at Rennes. Amazing player.
PSG could have signed him but they wanted him for free.
pedri for 20m >>>
As a subreddit- we have got to stop throwing around ‘world class’ so loosely. They both absolutely have potential to get there but they’re not currently ‘world class’ or even close
Even more than vinicius?
They can get dozens of French and Brazillian wonderkids with that.
Don't be cheap man..he's worth more than that 😉
Worst case scenario: Man gets injured. Club pays him forever.  Best case scenario: man is crucial in winning a decades worth of trophies. Real Madrid's paying his descendants in the year 5154235342.
He won Ligue 1 player of the month at 16  We saw Gavi and Pedri only a few years later who were also insane at that age, but when I saw Camavinga at 16 he was the first midfielder in a long long while I saw THAT good at his age, possibly the best
I wonder how much of that is a rumor spread by an agent or whether Camavinga was like Tchouameni and actually preferred Real Madrid.  30m seemed like a steal even for PSG at the time. I just can't believe PSG wasn't willing to at least match it.  I guess I can't complain since that transfer window was still a pretty good one for us, especially with the gap in transition from Leonardo to Campos. Though, whoever made the decision to become a retirement home and take on salaries of aging Messi, Ramos, and Gini over prioritizing a promising young player who was terrorizing us since he was 16 should definitely lose their job.
They’re Frances midfield. Isn’t that what world class means?
I think it just comes from different definitions of world class. I view it as meaning you’d start/be in the squad of a world 11 (so best 1 or two players in your position), but a lot of people on here are happy to throw it out there for any Real Madrid player or CL winner.   Given that it’s the highest praise you can give beyond just calling someone the best in the world, I do think it should be used more sparingly. You should be struggling to come up with players who are better in someone’s position for them to be called world class (and I think there are many players you’d name before Camavinga or Tchouameni)
Another jealous plastic fan. Can't wait for Benzema to pull a last minute hat trick against you in the semi finals.
He was class enough to turn around a tie after he was subbed against you lot. He played a role in both goals after 90.
I hate vincius for being an annoying whining cunt, not for his footballing ability. I hate Camavinga for his footballing ability and how god damn elegant he looks with his hair flapping around every time he moves
Probably seven
Fabregas was much better at that age but still
It always seemed very obvious (and there were media articles supporting it) that those two really only wanted Real and IF not they might consider other teams.  Real’s pull is simply unmatched. And no I’m not a Real fan.
They play for the 2nd best country in the world and the champions of Europe. But sure, not “world class”
No? Starting for your national team doesn't mean you're world class.
Thank you.. this is all I’m saying.
Jealous for what..?   I said they’re great players with potential to be WC.. how on earth can you argue Tchoumeni is WC when the guy doesn’t even get into Madrid’s XI consistently is beyond me. Cavaminga looks fantastic and if he keeps it up for multiple years, he’ll absolutely be WC.
They ain't getting pass Bayern lol
I don't know. I love having him in my team. If Barcelona had it he would take you to a way higher level. He's top 3 in the world imo. I see how you might hate having him against you for being too good. Hell I hated neymar because he was great
And thats what you don't want. Look at Rooney. Demigod at 18, almost washed up approaching 30   Edit: Guys, I didn't mean it that way. So much injuries destroyed his body, he could have achieved much more, and the other examples provided are way better. I just wanted to give an example. Thats all!
What about starting for the team that literally got 2nd in the world cup only a few months ago?
Ye but starting for France does have some weight
By that metric, every player who starts for them is world class.  I don't think anyone saw Arbeloa as world class even if he started for the most dominant Spain side in history.
more to do with prem fatigue. tired of hearing eulogies of foden's touch and how world class martinelli's pass is, but the moment non prem league talents are mentioned 'um lets not jump the gun here..' "is he premier league proven tho?" "how long has he been playing?" Not necessarily you, but its how we see it
I disagree I think hes a very good player but very overrated. Not even top 3 in Madrid IMO. I rate Benzema modric and Camavinga more than him. Courtouis as well but hes a keeper so its hard to compare
Rooney had a great career. Playing at a high level for over a decade is better than most can say. No idea why you would choose him an example over someone like Michael Owen, Hargreaves, Pato, or even Falcao
Yea who wouldn’t want a player like Rooney on their team…
Ahh yess, it would be an utter shame to keep somebody with the career of Rooney for the cost of $30M, you won this one.
Yeah but right back and midfielder are two different things
Last season he was the 3rd best after benzema and courtois. This season he's been the best. After him, militao and camavinga. I don't think he's overrated. We're not 1st in the league because teams were putting 3 defenders on him and benzema was awful. And fede is not that much of a threat as a winger.
Falcao is a poor example, he wasn’t overplayed, he just had freak back to back ACL injuries in his prime.    Still had a decent career too.
I mean in the world cup he was pretty average, he got handled in most of the other barca games this season. He obviously did very well in some other games this season like against liverpool but he seems to get completely shut down in a good amount of games which is why I dont think he’s currently one of the best
Messi in his best years was average in the world cup. So was cr7. It's not smart to make an opinion based on 7 games tops. I watch every real madrid game. He got neutralized by barca in 3 clasicos because ancelotti didn't have a good plan. He started a physically weak midfield and we had 3 shots on target tops. Even in the last game, I don't think it would have worked so well if de jong and pedri played. Vinicius like every player needs at least another attacker to help carrying the attacking load. Benzema has done it only in the past 2 games. Rodrygo too. They have been pretty average or bad this season. Vini has carried us this season offensively. With this benzema Barcelona wouldn't have won 3 in a row against real madrid, because this way vinicius find more space to perform.
You raise some good points, maybe it isnt fair to judge him based on the world cup. However Brazil arguably had the best team in the world cup stacked from top to bottom and he struggled to make an impact and Messi and Ronaldos teams were never as good as Brazils current team(at least on paper)  Idk if its fair to say barca wouldnt have won 3 in a row considering madrid beat barca pretty comfortably because Barcas 4 most important players were injured and we had to play a disgustingly bad midfield containing busquets and roberto with alonso in CB. And even then the first half barca was arguably the better team, second half was a different story though

man WHAT THE HELL IS AL FATEH'S BADGE
It's impressive how we only conceded 7 goals so far, Nuno really did some wonders for our defense this season.
I can see the sunshine at the end of the tunnel. Come on just 8 matches left
Siuuucond
I would like to believe that it’s an April fool’s joke, but they’ve had it for months now.
I’m pretty sure we have the least amount of goals conceded in every football league this season as of now.
I appreciate the effort lol

That staying for life thing sounds kinda ominous
Kinda sounds emotional manipulation
Ive seen a noticeable increase in barca posting nostalgic moments eapecially the ones featuring messi on insta in the last few weeks
"He should play with us for free. It makes him more happy."
Follow your heart and come to Ajax Leo ❤️🫣
We’ll take him we need a left footed right sided attacker badly and the PR would be even more insane than the Figo saga.
Fucking hell man he obviously doesn't need  the p just play for Barca for a season or 2 it'll be fun
papi ven pa Miami 🫶
Damn, didn't even left PSG and Barca is already bullying him into accepting lower wages again
Here we go again with the same bs
bare in mind messi won world cup in just a season with psg. barcelona is fraud
Riyadh wouldn’t whistle him either, come to Al Hilal
Do Barca ever buy players or just persuade players to run their contracts down
Don't they have to reduce the wages by 200 million????  They wouldnt even be able to sign him for free
IIRC isn't there a rule for footballers and a certain amount of money the club should be paying for them in La Liga?
Uhhh if they loved him so much, they wouldn’t have let him go in the first place. The relationship is broken, though probably no hard feelings. And since when is Barcelona a retirement club??
If he were to decide just on thoughtful calculation, he would stay away from la Liga's shit show. But yes he's heart seems to be at Barcelona.   Can't blame him, beautiful city, great club, shitty politics though.
He would've stayed the first time if he went with his heart bro.
The club he bankrupted with constant incremental contract improvements. With multiple UCL exits in a row hmm
This didn’t need to be said
How emotionally manipulative. You'd think this could stay behind closed doors.
Inter Miami is in shambles
Nah Messi you should get PAID my friend. 400m offer from SA was it? Surely Barca shouldn't try to manipulate you like that.   Fight for your worth Leo (and help tank their shit finances lmao)
How disrespectful to psg being referred to as an “afterthought” 😭. Also knowing their club is now an afterthought of the owners who are looking to buy united is fantastic as well.
🎵 Welcome the the Hotel Spotify Camp Nou 🎵
"Don't forget you're here forever"
Come play with us, Leo. Forever... and ever... and ever.
That is actually the barca way because they know Barca can’t afford him without those cheap tricks
Didnt they say he could stay the last time if he just played for free?
Yeah this is shitty. Saying this is just pressuring him to make him choose them lol
They still haven't even paid his deferred wages from few years ago. Lol
Barca special. Cheat and manipulate. No honor no class.
Fuck Ajax , come to Liverpool he can be the backup to Milner
If he does well at the 2024 copa I'm 100% sure he'll try to push for the 2026 WC, so if that happens he's staying at least 3 more years and maybe ending his career at the end of the next WC, à la Zidane
Even then, he can play 2 seasons, “retire” and come back and play a few games in Saudi Arabia for 60M each   Those morons will pay for Messi or Ronaldo for doing almost anything
Exactly, he is already financially dependent for life and for generations after him. And it's not like moving back to Barca wouldn't be lucrative for him, the commercial possibilities are immense and he could be given a higher percentage of his image rights and probably some highly paid ambassador role after he retires aswell  The guy has completed football, go back to Barca and focus on the best life for his family instead
vení*
cuidado, a la gente de aquí no le gusta que menciones ese nombre jajaja
“Bullying him” as if messi cares about what Barcas president from 20 years ago has to say Lol
Wages are already down 150M
Or increase income. Which they'd manage by signing Messi.
No
Yeah that's why he was not allowed to stay.
That's only if you're re-signing a player and I think that has to do with general Spanish law (can only reduce salary by so much).
They didn’t want to let him go though? They literally couldn’t afford to resign him
Just say you want to face raphina and ferran on the right
The man responsible for that is Bartomeu, of course players are going to accept those obscene contracts when offered. There are things that were far more damaging than Messi's salary, like offering Sergi Roberto and other squad players insanely high salaries
😂😂😂 so he would win games and trophies for them but off the field he was looking to bankrupt them to gain what exactly. Do you realize how stupid you sound.
>The club he bankrupted with constant incremental contract improvements.  If only you knew how much profit Barca still made off of Messi despite his insane contract you wouldn't dare to write this comment.
Yeah because they succeeded so much in Europe when he left..
He surely demanded those high wages but there was no way he knew Barca couldn't afford to pay him, he asked for it so they gave it to him, the problem is the president that authorized the whole thing
Why is it not exhausting being this moronic?
I want what you're smoking bro
Weak bait. Try harder lol.
Who knows about the finances better, a player or the president?  Messi asked for a higher contract and Bartomeu agreed. So who to blame here? Messi?  You expect a player to be more aware about the financial situation than the president?  And if the president didn’t have the balls to reject the demand based on the situation, why should the player be blamed?
Such a shady place, such a shady place
Hotel Catalunya was right there man
Heeeeeere's Messi!
This has legit been my theory since all of the players started speaking out at once: this would be a steal of a deal for Barça, economically and probably sportingly. No way that they get a comparable player helping to fix the attack at a similar price without the nostalgia discount, let alone one who brings such commercial benefit.
> Barca can’t afford him without those cheap tricks  He was going to play for next to nothing when the club was in a mess financially because of COVID, he wasn't allowed to. No club in the world can offer him anything close to what Qatar / Saudi / UAE clubs can offer.
Ouch
Lmao. Yeah I’m sure Messi is feeling the heat from our failed president from 20 years ago. Cry your eyes out
No I think the thing was that their finances were so fucked he couldn't even if he wanted to.
Actually no, Messi said no one asked him to cut his salary and he would have if they had asked. At least that's what I remember.  That being said, there will be 30 replies saying you can't cut a salary by more than 50% in Spain and then there will be 27 replies saying that's only a rule for something else.
He couldn't play for free. Laws didn't allow it. You can't have your salary reduced by more than 50 percent
and if he reaches the 2026 world cup it’s only 2 years from the 2028 copa america and if he plays that surely he’ll just wait out 2 more short years to play the 2030 world cup in Argentina
>a la Zidane  I hope Messi can at least end his career with his head straight.
And apparently La Liga themselves are now thinking of relaxing the FFP since so many of the clubs seem to be drowning apart from Barca
That "rule" has been debunked so many times. It only applies to the Segunda
Im ok with playing messi again, he’s probably the best ever but his track record against us has been less than stellar. Since 2018
Barto is Barca’s boogeyman apparently  Ignoring that multiple presidents have caused the state its finds itself in. Messi contributed to that and rewarded them with one semi final UCL appearance since 2015.
How’s all that profit they made working out for them. They doing well in the league and fully deserve it. yet they still needed to activate financial levers
They had their first two ever games in the champions league without a shot on goal after Messi left. They were dire without him. Broke the wrong types of records without him lol. But people wanna say he's the problem.
I remember about a decade ago some of the improved contract tension boiled over in the press with Messi and Javier Faus taking jabs at each other. Maybe Faus knew it was trending towards unsustainable back then.
https://barcauniversal.com/lionel-messis-nine-shocking-requests-to-renew-his-barcelona-contract-in-2020/amp/
Ahh yes always just Bartos fault, always him. Lets ignore the multiple factors that put your club in the situation it’s in currently  He’s your scapegoat for every fucking thing
Do you have an actual response to what i said or?
Your club bent their asses over for him and he left you high and dry lmao.
He renewed with your club 9 times. He’s your best ever player but he acted pretty damn greedy during the pandemic knowing full well your club was struggling. At least Florentino had the sense to cut ties with Cristiano when it made sense for both parties.
Plenty of levers at the hotel catalonia
I mean we're not exactly being discreet about it lmao. The only thing we can offer Messi that other clubs can't is the chance to play with his buddies again infront of fans who worship him so we're playing that angle.  But on top of it it's not just Barca fans/personnel, everyone wants Messi to come back so he's kinda getting pressured by the entire world.
They started speaking out because your fans started boo-ing him.....
> He was going to play for next to nothing when the club was in a mess financially because of COVID  what is the source to that? I know La Liga didnt allow him to stay, but i have never heard of Messi accepting such a deal.
They couldn't because there is rule in LaLiga that you can't have much cheaper contract that you had previously/currently, as minimum wage he could get was based on his previous/current contract. Rule that is trying to prevent exactly those shenanigans.
Actually, no such law exists. It was made up by a Barca fan account. People went through the entire rulebook and didn't find anything like that.
Average lifespan of a human is around 70-80 years, messi is 35 years old so he can play 11 more worlds cups atleast
Maybe not lol  But I can definitely imagine him ending his career at the 2026 WC no matter the result
Wow that is really smart on the side of La Liga. Relaxing FFP after fucking over clubs for 4 windows.
Bro he has like the most goals and assist in clasicos
2 hatricks against you guys and tore you apart in the semi finals of the champions league. Those are ages ago and maybe his recent performances were not as good as the previous ones, but when Messi is on the pitch he’s always the most threatening player
You’re forgetting that football is a team sport and theres 10 other players on the pitch. Messi cant carry the team in every game
> Ignoring that multiple presidents have caused the state its finds itself in  Literally Rosell and Bartomeu (who was Rosell's VP)
Our issue was due to Griezmann, his transfer fee was a huge ass loan we took.  A quarter of Coutinho's fee asw.
>How’s all that profit they made working out for them.  How is that Messi's fault?
As a Barcelona fan I just want to make it out of the group stage. So If we do that I’ll be happy enough.  Also PSG are fairly rubbish rn. Bayern weee objectively the stronger team overall and losing to them isn’t humiliating. At least I tell myself that…
Oh yes, because PSG were stacking CL titles before Messi arrived
Clickbait aside, those "requests" are entirely reasonable TBH.   He basically asked for a 3-year deal on the same net wages as before, a private box at Camp Nou for his and Suarez's family, repayment of the deferred wages (same thing Frenkie has asked for), a 10M signing bonus (which is cheap compared to the "loyalty bonuses" Barto used to give to Neymar), and a reduced release clause (to allow Messi to leave since Barto broke the hand-shake agreement when Messi wanted to leave the previous season).
Those are demands made by his agent(his brother if I'm not mistaken) and there's nothing wrong with that, at the end of the day as much as Messi might love Barcelona the club is a institution ran by people and he's a employe he should ask for what he wants
In any business, decisions made decades ago will have lasting implications. It certainly doesn’t stop once a CEO/president leaves.   Also, a player/employee should never be privy to the overall health of the company or club that employs them. Unless it is a part of their job description, they will not have access to metrics, p&l, revenue streams etc. If the club signs off an deals they cannot honor, thats on them.
What you said was so genuinely stupid it doesn't deserve a response, only to be contemplated and studied for prosperity.
lmao you will have to live the remainder of your sad life having to stomach that Messi is the undisputed greatest of all time. I can tell by your comment history. You must have been inconsolable after the World Cup.   hope you have a good weekend bro
Cant really say that messi dried them out when EVERYONE had insane contracts and insane transfer fees
I don’t really want that, I feel like it would be cool to see him at man city
I won't argue with that, and I think the boos were misplaced, but it also felt like Barça saw their chance and pounced, which they wouldn't have done unless they'd calculated that there were some tangible benefits beyond the emotional.
No I know there’s other reasons I was just clarifying what that person had misremembered. People had said that theoretically they couldn’t even keep him for free. Not that they asked him to play for free.
That rule doesn't exist I think? I think it's an old wives tale.
That would seem pretty strange to me… if the player is willing to accept a significantly lower wage to help the club, I don’t see why that shouldn’t be allowed.
They actually found it, but only for Segunda Division so obviously it didn't apply to Messi. But it makes Barcelona fans sleep a little better at night so this myth will never die.
He hasn’t scored against madrid since 2018
When were those hatricks? A long fucking time ago
And a private jet lol
It’s not that deep, i’ll live. You too
His team is the defending CL/CWC Champion and has the current Balon d'Or winner, I think he will be fine man.
Yes but messi made the most by far, that with Griezmann and Coutinho back to back you guys were fucked  We made the same mistakes definitely with Hazard. It happens.
nah barca has youngsters who will fight for him like arg does. messi can walk and provide his moment of magic that put barca over the top again.
It was mostly emotional because they only spoke out because it hurts seeing THE legend of their club and a personal friend of theirs getting boo-ed by a whole stadium for something that happened as a collective yet is being solely singled out.
Apparently La Liga had a salary cap at 70% of the revenue, and even if he'd have played for free the rest of the salaries amounted to 95% of the revenue, so there still was no way to renew the contract.
Literally to prevent situation like this, to prevent circumventing salary cap.
I mean it's like 5-6 games since then and half are Koeman tax
True, but Messi doesnt need to score to be threatening.
and yet they managed to be even worse without him haven’t made it out of the group since and got humiliated by frankfurt in the europa league
And you put that on Messi's shoulders? lol  In 2016, they lost to a legendary Atlético team. In 2017 they lost to a great Juventus side, and then there were the collapses against Roma and Liverpool which was more on the coaching staff and defence really. If 2 humiliating exits is "routinely" for you then that is an interesting interpretation of the word  The guy almost carried them singlehandedly to a treble in 2019, and in the one moment where he needed his teammates to step up they bottled it. I still remember him creating so many good chances at Anfield but the others kept missing. If they had just scored from one of those it would have been game over with the away goals rule
And how many times have we made the knockout stage since he left? He carried this team and its deadwood for so many years
Literally to take his family to Argentina for Christmas and back, LOL
Sure but that’s not what I want
He has not scored or assisted in his last 9 meetings against Madrid.  7 with Barca and 2 with PSG.
Threatening FC, did you win those games?
You think he couldn’t afford one already lol  Has to put his boyhood club that paid for hormone injections in even more debt.
Lmao I appreciate the honesty
Yes. Are you saying if messi doesnt score it doesnt count as a win, I dont get your point
The same "boyhood club" that splashed almost 300M on Coutinho and Griezmann before turning around and asking the Barca captains to take massive wage cuts to help them out? LOL
Ah the true el clasico is always in the comments
There’s no need to quote boyhood lol he was raised a cule. He’s the best barca player ever, im just saying he’s greedy and his image isn’t so innocent as you might perceive it.
> There’s no need to quote boyhood lol he was raised a cule.   Because he wasn't. Messi's boyhood club was Newell's Old Boys.  Messi moved to Barcelona when he was 13 because they were the club willing to pay for his medical treatment (when Newell's as well as River/Boca were unwilling to do so), not because he was "raised a Cule" (he wasn't—he became one after moving there).

2-1 goal?
Only clowns in Milan this year
WTF Milan! This mean Roma will almost certainly lose against Torino
Great results today, but if we really let juve back in the top 4 we'll all look like a bunch of fucking wankers.
lol they really did it. beat napoli 4-0 and then drop points to empoli. meanwhile napoli won. oh boy this ucl tie is looking hard to predict.
We're all joking and laughing, but at this rate Juventus could get a Champions League place at the end of the season
Infinite money glitch: If one of Inter or Milan drop points, bet your life savings on the other doing it as well
Lmao this result was predictable after Milan smashed Napoli 4-0 last week
Once again top 4 is lava
this top 4 sprint is gonna be amazing, and thank god we arent involved in it lmao
Serie Ass strikes again
Empoli best Poli confirmed
How did De Winter do?
It was obviously going to happen after Pioli rested everyone. You can't put Origi and Rebic in attack and expect goals.
i couldn't watch the match but can anyone tell me how the demon from Massa, Fazzini played?
I’m surprised Giroud celebrated so passionately, there’s no way he thought that would stand.  I can’t believe Juve will finish 2nd even without those 15 points.
The bottler cousins bottling. Top 4 about to be Napoli, Lazio, Atalanta and Roma at this rate.
Probably the challenge on Theo was a penalty but we can't always play this shit every time we change someone. We have 0 game Plan without Leao and Giroud
Please let’s win tomorrow I’m begging you
Thank you Empoli, very cool.
first of all Milan is not a team that can leave a player like Leao on the bench, they shit without him and second Saelemaeker is so frustration to watch every decision is shit, great game for a 0-0 tho.
I wonder if all the doomer Napoli fans that declared the fixture against Milan already over (because they only beat and not battered Lecce) feel better now
The Milan sub Is full of #Pioliout.  I Guess they Watch the game on Transfermarket and miss Just how Ibra, Rebic Origi and CDK are useless.  They Just miss or lose the ball. Any decent CL team  play the game before quarter finals  with the Subs.  And just like Inter with correa and Lukaku we draw against 14th and 15th in the League.  What a wild coincidence that the "No Money " market bring this result
Look at my rivals dawg  Scimmione Limone Scemone, Pobega on the field for 98 minutes, and the Goodfellas, thank God.    I mean it, the Champions League is gone, Aleister Pioley cooked too strong of a ritual and we can't do anything about it, but this is a time where we could really start to hurt from a credible force coming in behind for a final push in the league as well, we can still chill.
Milan plays the worst football among the top 7 teams in Serie A. The others may be inconsistent, but Milan is simply bad
Origi will get all the headlines but pioli is the real fraud for playing a garbage man for 70 minutes
Moment of silence for those who watched this match instead of the Sevilla-Celta shitshow
No replays on that foul on theo inside the penalty area?   Ok it was 100% a penalty https://twitter.com/belottiano/status/1644446620778663939?s=46&t=F_CqIo0lZZXPtf7HOEE1cQ
I want to be honest.   After our game there was a tear in my eye but now, after watching: Benfica.Napoli.Milan games (in that order) I can definitely say there's a smile in my face.   They keep saying we're shit but you know what? Yes, I can see the following team: **FC Internazionale Milano** in the UEFA Champions League final.   I don't want to jinx it and of course some luck is needed but my heart is full of confidence and hope
Napoli and ac sleeping at the wheel in the last couple of weeks
and their names are Pioli and Inzaghi
Two evenly matched squads and Torino are at home. Difficult game for Roma regardless of the circumstances.
considering allegri sacrificed himself and isn't on the sidelines tomorrow we're going to fuck it up and let juve back into top 4
Yeah, "look like"....
Just wait until we get the 15 points back
I never thought Origi could be that bad
0-0 tie both legs, all players take pens until it's sudden death with coaching staff taking pens
Somehow Juventus returned
Juve is crawling out of hell to get a cl spot
In 3 weeks
need Atalanta to be the last line of defense. At this point I trust them more than I trust the Milan clubs.  Also Fiorentina pulling a little sneaky being 4 points behind Juve
Or if Origi starts bet on Milan not to score
This comment will never get old. In fact the more overused and annoying it becomes the funnier it is
Full of energy Andrea Poli in shambles
A wall
Erased the legacy of Mazzola, Rivera and Pirlo.
No way Juve finish 2nd unless they win every single game left
That's what i'm saying. He also used to get stupid yellows. Sometimes don't understand him
He's seen Juve playing volley lately, can't blame the man
Can't believe Juve is gonna get CL with a 15 point deduction lmao
Even with them. 'Have Leao do something great' and 'cross to Giroud' are hardly genius tactical manoeuvres.
An Easter miracle would be nice
Origi, Rebic CDK and Ibra are useless.  After the midfield our only spot with a decent Subs Is left Wing. Messias/Saelemaekers
Nope its still over
Bad take. CDK offers more than Origi at ST, and rebic played decent. Cdk and Adli can both play wing, and CDK and Rebic can both play ST
Has De Ketelaere been that shit? I haven't seen a lot of him at Milan, but he was so highly before.
Milan players are ludicrously priced on Transfermarket, even your useless squad players who couldnt get a game at Empoli are valued at 20m.
Fans that always want to sack the coach are braindead. Maldini literally almost bankrupt the club trying to buy De Ketelaere for a measly 30m paid over the next 100 years
We play 1 good game and 7 shit ones but yeah Pioli is totally defendable
Not calling for pioliout but it was his decision to bench our entire attack, and for what? He ended up throwing all our starters by minute 70th so they didn't even rest.  >Just how Ibra, Rebic Origi and CDK are useless.  Yes they are, then i have to ask you, what did you expected when you saw a lineup consisting of Rebic and Origi upfront? He could have benched 1 or 2 players at best, he decided to bench Leao, Giroud and Brahim.  Not a single one of our starters rested and Theo and Tonali will be tired AF for the Napoli game.
It’s all in spalletti’s plan, luring them into a false sense of security
Aleister Pioley lmfao
Milan just lacked finishing today, same for us, on another day we would have overall seen Six/Seven goals  over the 2 games combined from Milan teams instead of one.
> Milan plays the worst football among the top 7 teams in Serie A  Allegri: am i joke to you
Our game Plan is ball to Leao and inshallah  Or in special occasions long ball to Giroud and inshallah again.   And people think Pioli is doing a Fair job this season. He has been hideous
Im sorry but we already won the “Worst Football cup” a few match days ago
hahaha how delusional are u brother?
I want your confidence in life
You getting false hopes from the Benfica game
You should go further, FC Internazionale Milano the first Intergalactic Champions of the Universe
You have looked much better in the CL, Inzaghi knows what he is doing in Cups. But still, Benfica are a damn good team and considering how much you struggled with Porto I would still put my money on them  Milan will beat Napoli IMO
AC
The players are hardly covering themselves in glory.  Except Origi. How he has not only managed to earn a living as a professional footballer but make tens of millions, win a CL and EPL with his level of ability is truly a miracle. People will be studying for years trying to reverse engineer his secrets.
At least the Milan teams have already dropped points in easier fixtures.
We?
Flair doesn't check out
He may even get worse!
They just keep sitting up like the Undertaker
And dragging us all in with them
Just need the kids to be consistent in this last stretch. We still don't have Koop back and Ederson has for been a man on a mission winning balls, but once he's back we're at full Gasp.
un momento che faccio il photoshop con la maglia della lazio e lo posto su twitter
If they beat Lazio they’ll be 8 points behind with 9 matches to go and with the tie breaker in hand. How is that unthinkabke? That’s pretty doable
There is not a tactic at all. Pioli is only hoping in some individuals
Messias and Alexis both play RW.   Rebic played decent, and CDL played better than Origi easily
Even if they play Origi again? What happens if the resistable force meets the moveable object?
Agree to disagree, I Can't stand Rebic this season.  CDK i Hope Will improve next year, but as now...
He made 1 assist. And made 3/4 good passes this season.  A lpt of People on the Milan Sub wanted him instead of Diaz as starter against Napoli.  I Guess the rate player based on Fifa Games
Been pretty awful. Rumors that he is on par with the youth players in training
Not shit enough to deserve 1/10th of the minutes Origi got
Dude won a scudetto with a guy that delivered fridges for work as starter.  the prize for that Is losing Kessie (After chala)  And getting Origi and CDK.
Only playing 20 minutes is clearly resting...
Both Salerinatana and Empoli were pretty poor offensively today. The Milan teams really should have taken advantage to get 6 points instead of 2.
For real Juventus is playing Better than Milan this year. Jokes aside
I'd give Juve their due and throw Allegris terrorball into the conversation
His comments are just incredible  I'm still not sure he's serious or just a giant troll and we live in his world
Football Club is my favourite Italian team.
Because he used to be the most clutch player in the world
Forgot to sign out of my burner account
Honestly, I really don't think how is that possible. Today during the game I thought I'd rather have Matri on the field than him, I really don't remember anything useful from him all game.  Not movement without the ball, build up, finishing, passing, whatever. Every component of his game is just dogshit and his attitude is like he is just in Milano on vacation.
Ho sentito anche le voci, stavano già avviando trattative con l'Empoli per Fazzini. È sicuramente uno che è stato richiesto da Sarri
Lazio are at home so hopefully we can make it 14 points with nine games. At that point theres no chance, so arguably Lazio have more to play for. Also they didnt play midweek or have Europe on their mind for the next one so it's a good chance for them to really secure CL football.
Which is exactly Roma's attacking plan, but with set pieces.
I also can't stand ante this season, but he was decent today
I wouldn't be spending big money in Belgium. The league is very average.
You don't need world class players to gain a bit of consistency against small and medium sides.  We have 6 defeats and 6 draws in 2023, relegation level.
Empoli were not poor offensively, they just went into the game with 0 intention of going forward. They spent the entire game literally in their own penalty box.
Without the points deduction theyre well ahead. But with a far more expensive squad. The defence and the results are much better than Milan but god is it awful to watch.
Probably he also has an Happy life
You dont have to tell me, I 'member the quick corner and his other big moments. Klopp must have questioned his own sanity bringing him on in those games. But damned if it didnt work.
Nah. It’s my only account
Ma è una mezzala o un mediano?
Ho visto le voci e infatti sono andato a vedere le partite dell'U21 dove giocava e mi ha fatto una buonissima impressione, battute da punizione fatte benissimo + buona tecnica e non si stanca mai. Sicuramente perfetto per Sarri e spero vivamente che lo prendiamo
That’s absolutely a possibility, but we were talking if Juve beats you tomorrow
Roma probably even play worse than us. But they are growing. We won the league and After that the motivation were faded for lot of guys. I think has no more to give for the team
Osimhen came from the Belgian league too recently... Sure, we haven't had a De Bruyne or Courtois coming out for a while but we're not that bad in terms of quality.
If we count 2023 league results alone, then Milan would be sitting at 10th. That's midtable, not relegation level. It's bad, but let's not exaggerate.  This team does have a hard time breaking down small teams who park the bus though. That's a con to Pioli's approach. However this also has a lot to do with the material. In 2020 the team was breaking these teams down with ease because Bennacer, Zlatan, Rebic, Ha*an and Theo were great at combining.  The 2022-2023 Milan is a lot more soloist, because key players like Leao and Diaz are soloists. Rebic and Zlatan are finished. Tonali is a workhorse, but his technical qualities are overrated. Giroud's hold up play and targetman ability is nowhere near Zlatan's.  Factor in the rotation, which lead to clowns like Origi starting and lack of chemistry, and you get performances like the one against Empoli.
It's hard to play counter attacking football with Caputo, he's 35 and as mobile as a tree.   Milan took the piss with their team selection, Empoli were always going to defend deep and force you to break them down. And it worked, they got a result at the San Siro, no small thing for a club like them.
I don't dislike them like that. I actually appreciate them
His wife is probably stunning
Penso che un mezzala
Mezzala
Sarri vuole assolutamente che questa squadra made in Italy accada. A soli diciannove anni ha un grande potenziale.
Yes agreed, your point stands. Juve have a realistic route to second place. For another 24 hours 😉
It happens, the players gave everything and rode a wave of momentum. It can be hard to stay at that level, it requires constant fresh blood. Look at Liverpool
Still not where I'd want to be spending 35m on a young talent and hoping he can adapt to Italy. But your right, the next generational talent could come through any time, you cant write off every player based on where they come from.
Why?
Idk they look pretty functional in the end. They play not very good but actually Allegri has a team full of problems (Pogba, Chiesa, Di Maria injuries. 15 point deduction, old people) and managed to have a positive season. He also is in the position to win Europa League.
Theres a lot of grit and maturity in the team. No one can defend a 1-0 lead comfortably like Juventus. They have some really good young players too. But something doesnt seem to be clicking for them in the final third. Hopefully that continues tomorrow

Gap down to 3 points. If PSG don't win tomorrow... 👀
Lens have done great in ligue 1 after getting promoted only a couple of years ago. It would be great for them to make UCL
Come on Lens... Do what your City rival did 2 years ago. Bring back the 98!
Allez les Sang et Or !
They’ll make UCL when they inevitably win the league!
Nice one, at Anderlecht they should be regretting his departure now
Fair play to Burnley, congratulations on your promotion, at least you haven't got ginger pubes at the helm 😂
Up the fucking Clarets. Burnley are back.
They deserved they were the better team and we never took our chances
Congratulations kompany
Rare Commentary W.  I am also happy there was no pitch invasion  I love seeing the boys celebrate in front of the fans
That smells like promotion
Great for burnley and Kompany. Hope he stays at the club next season
Welcome to the prem 🤝
You're happy now, wait till next season when it's Burnley kicking the shit out of your players.   Not looking forward to Burnley spending 90 minutes trying to injure Saka and Martinelli.
Tell me you haven’t watched Burnley since Dyche left without telling me.
Kompany burnley isn't the same dyche burnley
Seems like they kicked you in the head too. This Burnley team is closer to City than to Stoke or Dyche's Burnley. Even then they played decent football against mid to lower table teams
Why would I? The second you're back in the Prem we all know what happens. Burnley as a club means one thing - dirty , harmful, football. You'll kick the shit out of teams that would otherwise outplay you. Same old Burnley.   It's your culture.
Mhm, let's see how long that lasts in the Prem.
The same Burnley that went over 100 games without receiving a red card. Try watching a match instead of forming your opinions off r/soccer comment threads.
Get a grip
>It's your culture.   Mate their entire culture changed when Kompany came in. I don't understand how people can be so blindly confident about something they've not even looked at
Sevilla really fucked that up, these 3 pts woulda game em some breathing room instead they capitulate in 2mins at the end of the game
What a second half. That Acuña goal was incredible.   I’ve never really liked Sevilla, but seeing them struggle has made me realize how important they are to the league. I hope they come back strong next season.
Gutted. We put in such a great effort with 10 men, limited an inform Celta side to few clear chances until the last part of the match. For 75 minutes or so it was our best defensive performance of the season but then it was all undone in a few moments  Whilst it is clear that there are still things to work on(mainly the discipline of the team, we are collecting yellow and red cards like candy this season) there has clearly been progress in the first two matches under Mendillibar. Putting players in the right positions, not taking so many stupid risks in build up play, defending much better as a collective. I hope that the boys don't let the ending destroy their confidence because they put in a good performance overall  Going into the match, Celta were the shared(with Barcelona and Girona) 2nd highest scorers in La Liga since the start of February. They are a really good team and a few weeks ago they would have probably ripped our defence apart. It was good practice parking the bus before going to Old Trafford on Thursday, hopefully we can repeat these concentration levels and cut out the small mistakes!
Could end up being a big fuckup for Sevilla because they have several tough fixtures remaining: Valencia, Villarreal, Betis, Athletic, Real Madrid, Real Sociedad, Girona. Getting the 3 points today was so important.  They might get lucky because the teams below them are in abysmal form. Plus they have improved. But really big tests coming for them that will determine whether they avoid relegation or not.
2-0 the most dangerous lead lol , it's not Madrid tho
Atmosphere at Ramon Sanchez was crazy tonight, loved the match and the drama. Sure Sevilla bottled it but Celta capitalized off an otherwise perfect defense.
Sevilla...defended so well with 10 men the entire game too, completely lost their heads. Exactly how not to approach a relegation battle...
Una primera parte bastante aburrida pero la segunda parte ha sido espectacular. La cantera del Celta es una cosa de locos.
2-0 dangerous lead and all that stuff
wtf happened here then. 2-0 up in the 88th minute only to go and somehow draw, and then get a red card. talk about a collapse.  edit: oh yeah they already had a red. damn.
Happy getting 1 point
Oof
Sevilla played well, really looking forward to Thursday now
No way they bottled that
Sevilla why are you so fucking shite
Great game, loved Acuña’s surprise goal. Goal of the season ⚽️ but I do feel like Seville could’ve won, just let themselves go at the end. Too tired I suppose.
RFEF is a joke
Tonight the role of 2021/2022 UCL Real Madrid will be played by Celta Vigo.
It hurts a lot, but we were playing with 10 men for 70+ minutes against one of the most in form attacking teams in the league. For most of the match Sevilla defended really well and kept Celta at arms length  Mendillibar has simplified things, playing a bit more direct and putting players in their correct positions. I think we'll be fine if we continue along these lines
Acuña was quality today, also that filthy first touch from Dmitrovic's long ball leading to the corner which En Nesyri scored from. But of course he had to go and get sent off at the end and now he will miss the match at Mestalla next week -.-
I was at the game and even though I wished for Celta to take all three points I would say it's a fair result but Lucky for us since our conversion was lacking.
Sevilla only have themselves to blame, obviously we don't know what Acuña said for the second red, but hard to say that the first one wasn't a reasonable decision over the two fouls.
I think you are almost safe. Mendillibar is a fantastic coach IMO who sadly has experience in a relegation battle.
I hope so, I'm getting a good impression of Mendillibar so far. Since the whole club from players to directors were completely unprepared for a relegation battle, it could be valuable to have a coach with experience of it who won't panic  I still have a bit of a soft spot for Sampaoli lol, but his temperament was definitely not made for a relegation fight. The team reflected his bipolar mood swings on the pitch

I don't understand what happened, can someone explain?
That's world champion Acuna for you
I'm guessing he said something to the ref? The video itself doesn't show anything
from hero to zero
I guess he said something to the ref and continued  all the way
Huh?
ñ
 Friendly reminder that Vinicius got away with saying stuff to the ref   Fernando got a four game ban for the same thing, and Acuña will likely get similar punishment
Think he said something to the ref
Said the magic words.
Tottenham in Spanish
Typical Acuña really. Played a fantastic game and scored a banger then gets sent off for no reason and will miss the away match against Valencia  He's still one of our better players though and we will need him at this level for the rest of the season
you were there and heard what both players said? mind sharing us your privileged knowledge on what was said here?
Vinicius is not the source of all your problems:)
> Friendly reminder that Vinicius got away with saying stuff to the ref  what  he really did build an apartment in every La Liga fan mind huh
All players say stuff to the refs throughout the game…what’s your point? Such a dumb way to point out just one player. Smh.
I guess it’s more about the stuff they said?
Probably said "eres muy malo" or cleaned his boogers. On the other hand, saying "hijo de puta" is perfectly fine.
"Concha tu madre" - *to the air*
Like Diego Costa once vs Barcelona?
Don't compare Sevilla to Spurs lmfao
When I saw that he scored that fantastic goal I was like is he about to do something stupid.  Classic Acuña. Some players never change.
I'm just pointing out the double standard
I think we have 4 Europa Leagues and a Copa del Rey since their last title(league cup) lol  I was going to say that Betis are Spain's Tottenham, but they won Copa del Rey last year. They are more like Espanyol or something
Friendly reminder lewandowski got a three game banned removed after hinting match fixing.
exactly my point
Friendly reminder not to spread fucking misinformation like some QAnon-anti-vaxxer dickhead. Lewy didn't get shit removed, he served those three games of suspension against Atléti, Getafe, and Girona. And he also didn't hint at match-fixing. [He hinted that the referee was arrogant.](https://twitter.com/MichaelEmilio_/status/1590330200864485377?lang=da)
What's the earliest automatic promotion ever? 7 games in hand is pretty good going no?
PREMIER LEAGUE IS NOT READY FOR WHAT KOMPANY IS COOKING.  17TH PLACE, HERE WE FUCKING COOOOOOOME.
April 7th feels way too early for the English promotion posts. Must have been one hell of a season
Deserves a 3 day piss up tbh. Rude if they don’t.
Another bald fraud, lovely stuff.
Fair play, one of the best championship teams in a long time. Don't know if they will be able to play out from the back like that against pl teams though
And I thought Fulham last season were dominant, Burnley have absolutely destroyed the Championship this season.
Brilliant team. What a sensational job Kompany has done
I'm not ready for a Burnley that isn't Sean Dyche Burnley in the PL
never thought i'd be excited to see burnley back in the premiership, but here we are. congrats to the team and Kompany!
So happy for Kompany and Burnley! I don't think anyone could've predicted he would do so well when he was just appointed. I hope he will be as succesful in the Premier League and even if it doesn't go as smooth, I hope the board are patient with him and willing to give him the players he needs. It will be very exciting to see how he does in the Premier League next season, I'm so excited!  I wonder how many Belgian managers there have been in the Premier League, if any?
So deserved.  Manuel Benson, Premier League player haha. Love it.
So deserved! Will be interesting to see how they will do in the PL with their new system.
Couldn't even beat Watford should have promotion revoked
Fuck me they did it with style. Unbeaten at home all season
Pissed the league haven't we x
Vincent Kompany, what a man.
If anything, this just proves how fucked my club, Anderlecht, is. Kompany does so well in the Championship, which is one of the most competitive and difficult leagues to win. Even taking some players with him like Cullen and Harwood-Bellis.
What a night.   But Ashley Barnes, say it ain't so.
KOMPANY BALL
Welcome to mid table. It’s not so bad here. But it’s also…  *pause for dramatic effect*  not so good.
Truly, truly pissed the league.
You could tell there was something special there in that first game. Happy for Kompany
Up the fucking Clarets. Burnley are back.
Proud of Vincent Kompany. 100% deserved.
Sorry for doubting you at the start Vincent, I fucking love you. In other news, I'm gonna be skint (once again) next season but who cares eh.
Funny looking back on the threads when Kompany was first appointed because the reception was mixed to say the very least. Lot of people were (justifiably) judging him by his stint at Anderlecht but that club were also a mess at the time.   Full credit to Vinny and Burnley. It should not be understated what an unbelieveable job he has done. He and his coaching staff have not only got the team play some really good but also clearly very effective brand of football. To come in and replace such an iconic charachter in Sean Dyche and change lot of the culture and way of doing things at the club so fast is not easy to do at all. I also think the that it's been a blessing to play the Cup draws against Premier League opposition and Burnley can gather some data and learn from those games where they can still improve and how they match up to competition when next season comes around.   I'm trying my hardest to be very careful not to praise him too much because of how spectacularly Steven Gerrard has failed after his time at Rangers but Kompany truly deserves his roses. I never even saw him going into coaching back when he was still playing and always more or less assumed he would take a backroom role at City after he retires but guess Pep really made him want to pursue managerial career. Lot can change between now and when we move on from Guardiola but lately it feels like it's not a question if but what rather when.
How much can we get for Tella then?
WELCOME BACK BURNLEY
bloody hell, with seven games to go!
bruh already
Please buy Beyer for 20mil now, thx
Welcome back u troglodytes
Nice to see ‘em back
It was that classic football shirts sponsor that made it possible
Very excited to see how they and Kompany perform in the Prem.
Good to see them go up.  Imo they did a good job in the prem for years and spent their money wisely on their academy and improvements to the club rather than lots of transfers. Their net spend was like 60-70 million over that time. It's quite deserved imo
UP THE CLARETS!!!
Honestly crazy. Everyone thinks they're crazy for firing Dyche but then Kompany comes in and turns them into a machine. An entertaining Burnley would be much more fun in the PL than what they were before.
huge props to the burnley management to trust Kompany and give him the tools to turn it around. Even when we played them in the cup, I couldn't believe that the team we were playing was burnley. A decisive decision made at a decisive time
Mark goldbridge punches the air
This is football heritage
scenes when they win the premier league next year lol
Burnley fans, how's Vitinho?
Been to Turf Moor 3 years ago, been fan ever since.  UP THE CLARETS!  from a dutchie
It appears Sean Dyche was holding them back lol
Just like in my Fifa CM save. I relegated everton and Leicester from prem. See you in the championship everton and Leicester!
Vinny! 💙💙💙
[Obligatory ](https://youtu.be/4EvwoJ2yqpQ)
Kind of curious to see what Kompany plans for next year.  Norwich highlighted how playing great football in the Championship doesn’t translate seamlessly to the Premier League.   A more pragmatic style can be hard if you don’t genuinely believe in it and it can be hard to shift the dial in such a short space of time. There were moments tonight where the playing out the back seemed to suffer when the speed increased.
Josh Cullen the monster! On his birthday
Weghorst will do well for them next season
What a day, love this club. Can’t wait to see what the future holds. I don’t think this smile is leaving my face today
I’m thinking Burnley, Sheffield, … Middlesbrough?
It seemed inevitable Burnley would come up, but I'm still not ready for their fixtures next year
We’re back bitches!!!
I do like football. But not Burnley, Burnley can fuck off.
Led by un vrai entraîneur
Title next season, no doubt about it
We’ll uhh..just be taking Tella back down with us, thank you
Waiting for Kompany to raid the Pro League again
🎶*Here’s to you Vincent Kompany..* 🎶
I think we all have a lot of apologies to say to Vinnie
Oh, no. Troglodyte footba—  /puts finger up to ear  This just in: Burnley are now fun to watch, apparently.
HJALMAR IN THE PL, LET’S GO! So happy for my irl friend 🙌🙌 feels unreal tbh
Why square brackets?
Yeaaaaaahhhhhhhhh bet in there boyzzzzz
Daddy Shaun will sink them next season, it is known
ngl I'll be pretty sad when I tune into the PL and Burnley are NOT playing terrorball
Mark goldbridge crying
 when do they get the trophy of the efl championship
Mark Goldbridge on suicide watch
Not this again...
Congrats this year! fuck you next year and your 11 men behind the ball and tall as fuck striker you probably have for set pieces. (Haven’t paid attention to Burnely this year)
Parachute payments literally saved my club villa from spending 10 years in the 2nd tier and helped us bounce back to where we're now fighting for Europe but objectively and fundamentally, I disagree with parachute payments as a concept and I think it's ruining the Championship  Burnley and Sheffield United have walked an easy path to automatic promotion mostly because of their superior finance simply by being in the Prem recently even though neither of them are in the top 10 biggest clubs in the championship    >inb4 Burnley and Sheffield United are relatively big clubs and you can't name 10 championship clubs bigger than them    They are both respectable traditional clubs but neither of them are in the top 20 biggest clubs in the country that make up the ideal top tier    And yes I can name 10 current championship clubs bigger than them both (in no particular order of biggest, simply bigger than Burnley and Sheff Utd):    1.Middlesbrough 2. Blackburn 3. Norwich 4. Preston 5. WBA 6. Sunderland 7. Watford 8. Stoke 9. Birmingham City 10. Take your pick from Cardiff, Swansea or Hull City
The premier league needs a team like Millwall to join them.
Great. Was glad when they got demoted. Seem to do nothing but kick the shit out of players.
Not again 😡
Aslong as they don’t beat the 106 record I don’t care
Ah shit, here we go again
*sigh*
noice, I can know say I've had a kickabout with a prem player lol
Will we now get an apology from TalkSports Alex Crook and the rest of the English media who said we'd get relegated to League 1? I think the exact words Crook used were "death spiral"
Fuuuuuuuck goddammit
Ugh
Boro were unlucky
Watch out, Burnley coming to break some 18 y/o kids leg. Career ender club.
love to see fellow shithousers being successful
I can’t help but associate Burnley with Dyche and his style of football but I know it’s different under Konpany
Replacing Leeds I see
Congratulations
And now Sean Dyche might get relegated with Everton. I hate such cycles of life.
So, Beyer will be gone for good then :(  Happy for him, terrible we never really gave him a fair chance and are now losing one of the few really promising homegrown players we have had in the last years.
Raise due for Bellamy
Fair play, been brilliant all season
Going to be weird watching Burnley in PL not being managed by Dyche
Kompany is HIM
The more things change, the more they stay the same: there will be 2 teams in the PL wearing claret and blue next season. And one in the championship.
Nice
Well deserved
It's gonna be great to see what kompany's Burnley are gonna bring to the EPL.
They’re an improvement over Palace, that’s for sure
Mark Goldbridge in shambles rn.
Inb4 Kompany is invited to interview for the Chelsea job lmao
Congrats to Burnley.
Tielemans to Burnley confirmed.
Pukki's next home
They are in good Kompany
So should they just go for as many points as possible now then or just try to slow down a bit and try new things see what players work well with who
Extremely impressive season
Alastair Campbell will be very happy now.
A club I really like. Kept punching above their weight in the PL and I hope they stay in the PL for a loong time now
~~long ball football~~ sexy football coming to the Premier League.
FPL players will have their annual scouting caps on looking at Burnley's team
I imagine there would be a lot of great entertainment to be found in the threads about them sacking Dyche and getting relegated, from people who were convinced Burnley were completely fucked, would be stuck in the Football League for years, and only Dyche could have kept them up and brought them straight back up.  No-one would have expected Kompany to do this, but it does prove that sometimes change is a good thing.
GET IN
This is the earliest one in the championship. Leicester did it in 40 games in 13-14 as did  Reading in 05-06
This is the earliest one with 39 games. Next one is 40 and was Leicester iirc
[Apparently yes](https://twitter.com/CoachesVoice/status/1644444030082641925)
Yes, the previous record was Leicester in 13-14
Burnley still has a chance (I think they need to get 3 from all their remaining games) to break the points record in one season set by Reading
In terns of date, it was the 25th March, by Reading's 05/06 squad which did it on Game 40, but Burnley have done it a game earlier. They are also still able to better the 106 points record if they win every remaining game, and equal it by winning 6 and drawing 1.   They could also become champions on Game 41 matching Reading's earliest ever record, if they win their next 2 and Sheffield United lose theirs. Given it's Reading v Burnley next week, it's a guaranteed 3 points for Burnley there at least...   In both seasons, Sheffield United were miles ahead of third.
15th for sure
Looking at Leeds, west ham, wolves, Chelsea...I think you could be up near mid table
Nah you'll get off to a good start and be 4th after 5 games, everyone on Sky will start wanking Kompany off, and then you'll finish 14th and every time you lose a game Gary Neville will be there looking like a disappointed dad on MNF.
This is the way.   Will be interesting to see how it goes and if he can adapt to all the other teams being at a higher level. It sucks how often teams that are flying in the Championship come up and try to play the same way without adapting and just go straight back down again as a result
With the current state of the table... 15th easily
When we loan you Sambi Lokonga Kompany better turn him into the prime that he promised!
and in the 2024/2025 season, you will rehearse the foxes script and break the bookmakers for a second time ;)
The real question is are they going to play more conservative in the premier league? We’ve seen norwich and leeds with biesla try to play expansive football and translate what they have done in the championship and it has not worked
I’d be surprised if Kompany stays at Burnley next season.
Earliest Championship promotion since the rebrand (2004)
They’ve been dominant, even when they haven’t played well they’ve found a way to end up with a win, they could turn heads next season if they keep recruiting right
Well they are on 87 points, second place is on 76, and third on 68.  So I thinks it’s safe to say they’ve had a pretty good season so far.
I've heard Kompany loves West Street Live on a Sunday night
I’m sure if they didn’t turn up to work on Monday you’d be happy
We owe you one to be fair, after the 5-2. Hungover or not.
Just make sure you play our lads, yeah?
Leeds went on a piss up after getting promotion, half the team was rotated out because they were hungover (including, I'm pretty sure, Klich's first game not starting under Bielsa) and we played some of the most free-flowing football I've seen because we didn't really care, hah.
The Prem is becoming to Pep Guardiola what Serie A is to Gasperini.  Arteta, Kompany, even De Zerbi has said Guardiola is his model.   I unironically believe that stuff matters in terms of legacy, maybe not as much as trophies or achievements, but when you change the way the game is thought of, your greatness is immortal, and Pep Guardiola is the best manager in history hands down.
he might be the baldest of them all..have you seen the size of that head??
Not well if their FA cup tie against Man City is anything to go by. Then again, that shouldn’t really be the litmus test
I do worry for them tbh. They are better than our 18/19 squad was but even we showed so much promise just to get pummeled. Hope Burnley do better than we did.
They'll get stomped but there's always a couple surprises at the bottom.
Last seasons Fulham were the best attacking Championship team I've ever seen but this seasons Burnley are more balanced
Its been a very weak championship this year like
We beat Fulham 4-1 last season. This Burnley team are miles better.
Everyone thought he was done after the miserable player-manager role he had
Bit easier when your team is worth like 10x that of other teams in the league
Do they play good football now? My issue with Burnley was always the absolute dog shit brexitball they used to play under Dyche.
seeing sean dyche with everton against burnley will feel so wrong  assuming they stay up and he’s still there of course lol
I can't root for them with how dirty they did Dyche but I'm excited they found attacking football. Always room for more of it in the prem.
Pretty sure he would be the first, I can't find any other in my research
Crazy isn't. Even Al Dakhil from Sint Truiden lmao. Glad for them tho.
Maddest thing is that he's genuinely been one of our better players this year. Really come alive after a couple of months
Was he not good in the Belgian league? Just curious.  He has been pretty spectacular for us this year
More importantly we didn't beat Blackpool in either fixture
Watford is respectable, Blackpool on the other hand...
Only 1 league defeat since mid-August.  In 15/16 we went 23 unbeaten which was a big achievement & the crowning jewel of that season. If we avoid defeat on Monday, looking at our remaining fixtures, it is very possible we'll out-do that as well.
We haven’t won it just yet. We’re only promoted. But we’re definitely on track to win it.   As for your club, OOF yeah not good
The Belgian league really is on a huge upswing as well and its simply getting harder and harder to do well in it.  Think Kompany happened to take over at Anderlecht right about when this upswing started to manifest itself.  Not to say Anderlecht didnt fuck him over in some ways, but well, Club Brugge currently are  experiencing the same problems with, on paper, the strongest team in the league.. which no one expected either.
You don't rate him? He's been doing really well and is basically a lock for cb at 22
Been great for us, sort of a utility man as he's played RB, LB, LM, RM and somewhere in CM a couple of times I think. Technically a very good player and has chipped in with goals and assists.  For a million euros he's been a bargain
Absolute quality. When you need someone to perform he's always the one to step up and has been a vital utility player. Well loved by the fans also
If you watched the City v Burnley game for the first 30 minutes of the game we did a very solid defensive game and controlled the game shutting down City. We unfortunately conceded two goals in five minutes after that and at that point we went for it to try and get back into it and that opened up the game. I think had we played our first choice keeper we'd wouldn't have conceded the first two goals. But the point is, I'm confident this style of football can work in the prem. We also destroyed Bournemouth with the same style
Weghorst won't play for us again
wet horse is surely a manu starter but i doubt he would play for burnley. hes not burnley quality for sure
They are always so hard for us, and this team is even better.
They 100% play vetter football than spurs do nowadays
Need not worry, this is an entirely different Burnley than we've ever seen. Very pleasing to watch when they play, Kompany has changed that team up for the better.
His best mate Obafemi is on a permanent now so I think he'll stick in the prem
He'll have to wait in line I think, scouts everywhere probably are salivating over union s-g /genk/ some gent players
Citeh loves you more than you could know…🎶
He's been fantastic for us this season
Sean Dyche's Burnley was the last example of a mostly British premier league team, the last reminement of a soulful no fucks given English club from the 90s and 2000s. The premier league has been heavy commercialised and globalised for a long time now but Sean Dyche's Burnley were like a team from a past era placed into the modern era.    When Dyche's Burnley were relegated, a piece of English football was laid to rest for good. The premier league is now forever a league full of foreign mercenaries playing for a pay check with no care for the club or local fanbase they play for and aimed at a plastic international customer that has never been to England that thinks Bournemouth are a top tier football club and would have his brain melted at the concept that Sheffield Wednesday's ground is over 3x the capacity of Bournemouth even though they're in the 3rd tier.
Once they've won the league, which could be after Game 41. They will likely have it presented at their final home game.
Somehow Burnley have returned...
They're like Barcelona now...
You're going to be so disappointed.
Preston are bigger than Sheffield United and Burnley?   You sir, are a moron.
I think you're overestimating the impact of parachute payments - it took Villa three bites at the cherry to come back up.  If Bruce had clung on for another couple of weeks you would've need a fourth go.  Look at the clubs you listed - with the exception of Preston they all went down in the past 10 years and had extended stints in the Championship - Blackburn and the Mackems even spent time in League One.  Do they help? You betchya - but they aren't some cheat code that leads to an automatic bounce back, and as Sunderland showed if you don't spend them wisely it can go south verrrrrrry quickly.
🎶Unai Emery’s burgundy and cyan army🎶
That’s the most creative take on “claret and blue” I’ve ever seen.
Scunthorpe to rise up the leagues again!
Still in our sights, but only just.
Such a quality player thanks for sending him! He's actually the player I rate most in our team. The way he takes the ball forward on runs from the back has been key to initiating a lot of our attacks. He basically becomes a midfielder at times and draws in players to offload to the wings.
> Leicester did it in 40 games in 13-14  and we'll fucking do it again
Wow they got promoted in 13-14 and won the League in 2 seasons... stuff of dreams!!
Burnley to win the league in 2025
and that Reading side got 106 points (which is what burnley will get if they close out the season with 6 wins and a draw)
Man city could break this record if they get found guilty
Oh man Reading, such an afterthought these days, would be one of the first 10 teams I would name in the league as a kid back then. (Opta would probably write) Ruthless.
Interesting that we were left off that list with our 41 from 96/97, which was obviously before anybody else on that list achieved it.
Also shared with Reading 05/06.
Never thought I'd see a fellow Leyton Orient fan here. You remember the playoff game at Wembley?

Chelsea 😂😂😂
What a silly season 😂
When’s the last time Man Utd made it past a UCL QF if u don’t mind me asking?
West ham is goated 😤😤 (I cook teams with them in fifa)
I will not tolerate any Gracia slander 🤨
Fulham used to have that problem but look at them this season, comfortable top 10 finish is likely.
> easily  Nothing about that is easy
People always say that every year.
I can't see that happening tbh, they won't be able to play the same style of possession football while winning so often in the Prem, they won't have the quality to just roll over teams every week in the tier above.
Literally no one knows how they'll do  That said Burnley have pissed the league even harder than we did and we finished 2 points behind Arsenal
In APRIL? pfft. In 05/06 we had the title wrapped up on April Fools day and promotion sealed a week earlier, albeit in Game 40.  In all seriousness though, congratulations on an amazing season, there are a lot of people in Reading concerned about our points record bring overtaken by you and that is a compliment.
£2.50 for a double, even on VK’s money that’s top value.
Fucking hell seeing West Street Love referenced on Reddit really makes me miss my days living in Shef
Nailed on starters tbh.
Arteta in particular with Zinchenko and G. Jesus coming in directly from City was almost like Pep creating a friend to play with.
Pep’s mentees have mostly been great coaches, meanwhile Ferguson’s are pundits or shit lol
I mean, the honor for that should go to Cruyff then, since Pep and all his acolytes are just following his principles.
Ten Hag too. They worked together at Bayern.
It leaves a lasting impact on the game.   It’s why, in my opinion, Cruyff is such a legend. Not only because of his play on the field, but because the legacy he left and influencing so many like Pep.
Bielsa is also very prolific when it comes to those he mentored and/or those who studied him
Could you elaborate on that Gasperini part? Genuinely interested
People gonna keep denying reality
As much as I like Pep more, Ferguson is yet to be beaten for GOAT manager status.   That guy reinvented teams, took teams that shouldn't have been able to compete to titles, took on a challenger in Wenger that arguably did more to change English football than anyone in the modern era, took on the pre-FFP Chelsea and broke their dominance.
SAF is the best manager of all time hands down
Beautiful joke 😂
LMAO. Let me know when he wins a CL with City.
>Pep Guardiola is the best manager in history hands down.  As good as he is, that is ridiculous when he has never overperformed with a team even once and has coached Barcelona, Bayern and Man City. No way does he have the best coaching performance of all time, but his tactical legacy is legendary  Leaving behind a legacy is not the same as being the best coach either, especially when you only coach ultra rich and dominant clubs
I’ll bet on Vieira getting a second shot in the PL too
Letar not forget, not in PL, but there’s also Xavi.
Think Kompany said it best.  The aggregate score between Burnley and City was something like 46-2 in the previous 10 games.  Even if it didn't work, it was worth trying something different.
Well in the same vein we put 4 past Bournemouth in the cup and were very competitive in a 2-0 loss to Man Utd
I'm hoping we will be like Bielsa's Leeds. They got absolutely taken apart a few times but were good enough to take points from the lower part of the prem.
Yea we get battered by City either way. City put 5 past us under Dyche plenty of times.
Playing Devil's Advocate here but we didn't field a full strength side. Man City did.
They were well in the game in the first half but they are Championship team and in the end our quality made the difference.
I mean, obviously Man City are way better than Burnley are currently still.
Also worth mentioning you had Pukki as a proven goalscorer, Burnley don't have that which will make it hard for them in the Prem. I don't see Ashley Barnes or Jayrod having a Prem resurgence or Lyle Foster lighting up the level. And I don't think Tella will step up quite this much (not to mention they don't even own him and Maatsen, arguably their two best players).
Fulham also lost 10 games last year.  Burnley have lost 2...
Is that the general consensus? I didn't wanna make an opinion with us just being promoted in what seemed like a very strong season.
Dumb question: why do some people say "like" at the end of their sentence?
Pep taught him well
Burnley made ~£40m profit this season and lost all their better players and what had been the core of their side for years? Lol.  Teams who go down and get picked apart like that never usually bounce straight back.
That's not true though is it?  Sheffield United, Boro, Norwich, Watford?  Teams that Burnley are miles ahead of in the league
You obviously don't know anything about our transfer history last summer then...
Splashing out doesn’t always work out in the Championship, we spent heavily when we went down and it backfired, it isn’t an easy league at all
Very lazy way to put it. Grass is also green yes?
Burnley fans are going to go “Ooh, that is why people hated Dyche’s Burnley”
Dyche's time at the club had come to a natural end. Should've gone earlier if anything.  Don't let that keep you from liking us.
I’m guessing you weren’t a huge fan of the Nuno/Mourinho/Conte era then?
Burnley fans had 9? Years of Sean Dyche.. I bet they are loving VK
Martinez at Everton?
Yeah he was good, but I don't think anybody expected him to be playing Premier League football :)
I love him but we really need the money. We have to rebuild half the squad next window
Easy task tbf
my guy its an Inbetweeners quote [about Burnley fans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRoVPMwBOdo)
Tragic.
Sir, this is a Wendy's
 What defines how 'big' a club is? There are many factors, usually a combination of three main factors I think 1. Size of fanbase/ground capacity 2. Historical success/trophies in the cabinet 3. Recent league performances   Preston, Burnley and Sheff Utd all have similar sized fanbases, I would say Preston are overlooked because they have never been in the Premier League since 1992 but they are by far the biggest team that has never been in the Prem, looking at the current Championship 19/24 teams have been in the prem since 1992, it's only Preston, Luton, Millwall, Bristol City and Rotherham that haven't (I hope Luton or Millwall win the playoffs)     The main thing for me is that Preston North End in the 1800s were the only other top flight team apart from 03/04 Arsenal to have an invincible season.
There's a lot of people in Reading that see quite concerned our record is about to go. 7 more wins and it's yours. Reckon your lads will take their foot off the gas?
Sad fox noises 🦊
Despite that you probably wont know FC Groningen, I feel like a very similar situation is happening at the clubs
Not with Jesse Marsch you won’t
Looking more like you’ll be doing it in League 1 again tbh
You guys have really fallen down, damn…
Not if we beat you to it!
Make sure you follow it up with a great escape (including ostrich-based press conferences) and then a title win.
10 year anniversary tribute
You gonna financially dope again?
14th in 24/25, surprise Premier League winners in 25/26. It's the Leicester script, ten years later.
Doing a Kaiserslautern
Ah don't worry. The bottom is so tight this year, I still believe for you guys.
They were bottom of the league until the 18th April 2015 too.
Tell me more!
The championship after they go back down?
That would be amazing for them. Would help them in some history and character development
:(
That was the Division One era, this stat is based on the Championship.   Which btw I think is complete and utter bull shit.
[removed]
I can see it getting worse with Chelsea next season they will have so many unhappy players on huge contracts that want champions league football etc....   Please don't let this comment come back and bite me in the ass next season Lmao
I think 10/11 but I don't think Burnley will be in the Champions League next season unfortunately
Key players like Palhinha and Mitrovic. They’ve been in free fall without them recently.
Fooking world cup getting in our way.
Choccy milk shot as well
Surely still not go those prices going today? I'll pack up my things and be half way up the M25 in 2 mins if so.
Thoughts on McAtee? I’ve been saying for years that he’s the biggest talent the academy has produced since Foden. I know he got off to a slow start but what’re your thoughts since?
Carrick might be the one to finally buck that trend
Fergurson's biggest part in him being a better manager than Pep overall though is him doing it with a non-top tier team though. I genuinely want to see what Pep can do with a team that's not got major financial backing or expected to walk the league
Or shit pundits
So…it’s easy to copy Pep but impossible to copy SAF?
Pep will never hold a candle to what SAF is or ever was. Keep the GOATs name out your shifty little mouth.
Lol
true, they all look like bald manatees
Hughes, Bruce, Queiroz, Kidd, McClaren, Rooney, Carrick, Ole, Strachan are all hardly shit.
Well Pep combines the absolute domination sustained over an entire era of football with the forward thinking innovativeness that makes his ideas endure forever. Like, he was a disciple of Cruyff like Cruyff of Michels and so on, but it's his way that became the "meta" and won him everything there is to win.
Yeah but they’re all just from the Bill Walsh coaching tree
I completely agree with Cruyff being the defining factor in Pep’s philosophy.   Having total faith in his teams ability to play as he has instructed no matter who they play is probably what defines Pep. A true perfectionist without seeming like it phases him.
Juric, Palladino, Bocchetti at Verona(technically only an assistant due to patent shit but he was given the job at first), Sottil, all consider themselves disciples of Gasperini and play very similarly, the high line, back three, playing off pressing the opposition to retrieve the ball high, quick transitions, many players joining the attack...  It also helps that the model was used to turn a yo-yo team into at the very least a team that regularly fights for European places, and so obviously other midtable clubs want to follow in the footsteps.
Yep, fair point. Albeit a Bournemouth side that at the time were bottom of the league
Yeah but then you’ll have to deal with all the casual fans telling you when you get beat that “you got found out” or going wow such amazing football lost 5-1 lololol   Ignoring the fact any newly promoted team is gonna be the underdog regardless of how they play
Agreed pal
Probably why he said you’re more balanced, he’s implying you’re better than them defensively
Well two of the relegated teams have absolutely shat the bed so that definitely plays a factor. If you rule out two then the third should really be massive favourites. I didn't expect Burnley to be that third at the start of the season though so fair play
sunderland doing so well after 6 years in league one
Norwich, Watford and WBA have all failed to live up to expectations at the start of the season. Middlesbrough too until they got their shit together.
Yeah, probably. Don't want to take anything away from Burnley here but it's been a bit of a mess this season up the top. Sheffield Utd can barely keep the electricity on and they'll be coming up soon, Boro and Luton look like the only other promotion-worthy teams but somehow I'm sure fucking Preston or someone will get promoted instead  Norwich and Watford are still in the hunt and both have been pretty grim by their recent standards. I feel like Millwall usually the championship standard and it looks like they're going to crawl their way into the play-offs fairly easily
Just a UK colloquial thing
It’s a thing in certain parts of the UK and Ireland. In speech it’s a filler word, it makes a sentence sound less formal.
It’s used a lot in North East England (although not exclusively), mainly just as a way of adding emphasis.
You just put it in like when your thinking of the next words or so like.
Lmaoo
People will upvote any old shite.  Burnley lost Nick Pope, Tarkowski, Mee, Collins - the entire defence and Cornet and McNeill their two best attacking players, on top of losing Chris Wood in January before relegation.  70m in sales and several big names released on a free.
it's becoming more normal for the same teams to yoyo due to parachute payments
[Here's the list.](https://www.transfermarkt.com/championship/startseite/wettbewerb/GB2)  Burnley's total market value is €132m. Watford are close 2nd with €130m, but Sheffield and Norwich are at €105m already and then it's €82m for Boro and all others are €70m and below.  So yeah, Burnley and Watford are clearly the most valuable teams in the Championship.
bruv you're top of the league what you on about x
Whilst we didn't particularly spend big money on anyone other than Lyle Foster in January, we still spent £38m on the rebuild, albeit with an almost £40m transfer profit
We've already had a good number of matches like that this season.  Can't be a hypocrite and blame any team for doing it, but god it's frustrating.
I still think Dyche could have kept you up, and you really shouldn't have got relegated. Regardless, impressive what Kompany has done and how your club has rebuilt - didn't expect to see you back up so quickly. Fans must be chuffed.
Dyche can only play one style of football and maybe it's enough to get you the occasional top half finish but that's about it. Kompany is already a better manager so it was obviously the correct decision.
It was not as fun as previous years to say the least
He’s Spanish
Martinez is Spanish lol he just managed Belgium
Martinez 😂
What 😭😭
Everyone knows the many famous Belgian Martinezs
He’s Spanish

he’s not belgian lol

Oh were you put on the brink of relegation by a Northern Irish dwarf as well?
Still collecting more silverware than Spurs
that Leicester season will never cease to blow my mind. We'll be telling our grandkids about that, even if football no longer exists and the world is a nuclear wasteland,
Did she put up a fight?
second tier started in 2005 like how the pl started in 1992  also its not based on the championship, cuz it wasn't champs in 2000 for fulham
My friend bullshit is one word. Not disagreeing with you but that space between is making me fuss
Nah no chance, this season is about as bad as it can get for a team with basically unlimited resources
Those players will win the league with the easy non-Europe schedule. Seen it all before
This is such a bad take holy
Most of them either came in the winter when it was already obvious we aren't gonna make the CL or have already won it somewhat recently. Aubameyang is sadly a lost cause already  I guess but I agree that sterling could be unhappy next season.
> they will have so many unhappy players on huge contracts that want champions league football etc.  I mean if they sulk about it then maybe they shouldn't have played like absolute shit this season
I don't think we will be firing on all cylinders but I am hoping we can clear out the squad this summer
First.... *Knock on wood*   I could absolutely see some of our problems continuing into next year and I don't think we're just going to bounce back into top 4, but I don't really see it getting worse. Part of our problem this year was actually that we had too many players competing for the first team and rotation made it hard to find a stable starting XI. Selling a few players, even if one or two are big names will help in that sense.
They need a mourinho
bet
If an elite manager comes in for a full pre season they’ll be fine
>I can see it getting worse with Chelsea next season they will have so many unhappy players on huge contracts that want champions league football etc....   Well, those guys should probably get together to fix that.
We came 10th in 15/16 and bounced back to win the prem in 16/17, yes man city were in a rebuilding period between 14-17 but we could definitely bounce back to 4th next season which I think all fans would accept after this season.
I think I just threw up a little bit in my mouth after remembering those
Chuck Norris or go home
Coco milko
They've both come on leaps and bounds since they debuted for us. Brillant for the midfield and help with so many chances,creating runs or running in themselves.
Looked very lightweight and didn't seem to have the physicality for the championship and was a bit of a spectator. Got dropped and took him a while to work his way back into the team. For me I'd rather have him do that than be decent/average consistently all season - probably the first time in his career he hasn't been good enough for the level he's playing at and he's shown the mentality to improve rather than giving it the Billy big bollocks that we see so often from loanees from PL sides when they struggle in the lower leagues.  He's got good close control and decent awareness, intelligence and decision making in the final 3rd. He's a natural finisher as well and is surprisingly quick in a foot race. I'm still on the fence on whether he'll go on to be a top top player as he's still got a long way to go, but he's on a trajectory to be a similar style of player to David Silva.  Him playing with Ndaiye has done him a lot of good. Ndaiye has got that confidence, quality, and inventiveness that rubs off on everyone around him.  As for Doyle, he's crap and you should definitely sell him to us for a bag of crisps in the summer (assuming our embargo is lifted or if crisp-based transfer fees get around it).
He's fantastic and he's still only out second best City loanee. Doyle has been even better
I'm not holding my breath but I'd hope Rooney making it big too someday.
Could end up doing a Roy Keane who was class with Sunderland and turns out he's a piece of shit manager
Hard to replicate the success when you don't have the good 'ol Fergie Time
Exactly - and to be honest given his failure to win the CL with City, you could argue that Pep's underachieved at City. Like... of course they win the league half the time with the most expensive squad in history, but it's Champions Leagues that set you apart.   Plus, achievements are relative to the money you spend vs the competition. If you spend 100 times the rest of the league put together and win 9 titles in 10, the best manager is the one that won the 10th.
Or Pep is just a better teacher.
i do think some of the difference is that part of SAF's success was his sheer force of will
except none of them have shown the ability to Pep's playstyle. It just indicates Pep likes more tactically adept players.
Pep is a tactic coach easier to copy that. Than whatever SAF was cooking.
Gaslighting lol. Pep just is a better mentor and his pupils are proof.
SAF left the coaching and tactics to his team and namely Carlos Quiroz for most of the 00s whilst he focused on management. United regressed really fast interns of style of play as soon as Quiroz left - with the gap no more apparent in the CL.   When SAF replaced Quiroz with Phelan and went back to classic English old school football with rigid wide players like Valencia they continuously floundered in Europe, tactically they were just poor.   It's probably because SAFs style is about the environment and team and people he put together to manage diff components and got the best out of them - the philosophy was dictated by his deputy who influenced the style of play far more than SAF (see the almost overnight difference in style of play from Quiroz to Phelan). Peps is lent far more into football philosophy.
Stay mad 😂 Pep is the better manager and has bossed the Prem, Bundesliga, and La Liga.
Hasn’t won the Championship like Vinny. You know why? Cause he’s a fraud.
Cruyff's way became the meta, as seen by pep himself
*"Absolute domination over an entire era of football"* despite only reaching 3 Champions League finals and not winning the trophy since 2011, or with his most expensively assembled team.  People vastly overstate the achievements of Pep. He's achieved basically what you'd expect given the insane resources he's had to work with.
Absolute domination sustained over an entire era? And yet Zidane has won more Champions League in 3 seasons than Pep in over a decade
Absolutely! It will be a tough tough season next year. But there is reason to believe and I will have the faith in Kompany!
Putting 4 past a bottom level Premier league side is never bad though, you know? That’s what it takes to be at least mid table.
Beginning of season Burnley were 14/1 to be champions, Sheff Utd 12/1, Norwich and Watford 6/1. Bookies must've thought Norwich and Watford always bounce back but they messed up this year.
And a lot in the North West at the beginning of sentence xD
Not to mention their talents who would have excelled in that division, like Weghorst and Cornet. Westwood, Lennon, Lowton, Bardsley, Vydra all had 50+ appearances too. Basically gutted the whole squad and got a new one in with a completely new system.
Totally forgot that Corner left, didn’t he go to West Ham?
You would have a man city flair lol
>People will upvote any old shite    "That's an interesting argument Senator, can you back it up with a source?"   "My source is that I made it the fuck up"
What was that at the start of the season?  Using our market value after we've pissed the league is a bit stupid, no? Half our squad has doubled in value since August. Cause vs effect... think about it
surely the team's value is at least somewhat a product of burnley's runaway success this season. in that sense its somewhat of a tautology to say the most successful team is the most valuable, because i mean yeah, obviously they are
Ah yeah value estimates from Transfermarkt that literally increase because the players are playing well.
Fair point, but also our team was gutted... I believe we had 6ish first team players from the previous season still on our books at the start of the transfer window? An average player cost of £3m across 10 players to fill those squad gaps doesn't seem like a ridiculous over-spend.
Idk, I've described teams that my Sunday league team have played as brilliant. Especially ones that have pissed our league.  If someone responded to that with "brilliant if you dont include Premier League teams. They'd be bottom 5 at least", they'd sound like a complete idiot.
Spoken like a person who has not seen a single Burnley game all season. Cheers for clearing that up.
Burnley will win the prem.   Mark my words
I mean you can do this all the way down. Every player that’s ever played football who isn’t Messi/Ronaldo/Pele is also shit, right?
I doubt they would have stayed up under Dyche, remember as soon as he was sacked Burnley got 3 wins on the bounce and a draw, yet they still couldn't stay up with that
>Kompany is already a better manager so it was obviously the correct decision.  I obviously love Vinny and he has done unbeliveable job at Burnley but bit premature to say that?
Let’s just say I was drunk, he was only coaching Belgium😂
I was tired alright😂

Nahh a Dutch giant called Bas Dost

God damn. Savage but true.
"What he say fuck me for?"
It really speaks to the modern state of the Premier League that we all find that so remarkable, like sure it was to some extent and there are certainly other factors that make their particular season impressive, but also the top 3 of the table being exclusively big six clubs didnt happen until the late 90s. There used to be variation at the top, and now the idea of any of the other 14 clubs winning a title is literally the stuff dreams are made of. Kinda bleak.
>even if football no longer exists and the world is a nuclear wasteland  Sir, this used to be a Wendy's
Dow, doobie do, doobie do Doobie, doobie, doobie Dow, doobie do, doobie do Doobie, doobie, doobie, dow
Yep, our 98-99 was also remarkable.
Bullshit is one word but bull shit is two words
Yeah no way they’re this bad for that long. It’s only a matter of time before they buy the right finisher to put alongside some of the talent they have.
Bruh that’s what they said about United 10 years ago
I didn't watch Chelsea a lot recently, is Aubameyang really bad or he just doesn't suit Chelsea's style?
I really appreciate the write up. Not surprised that the physicality of the league was a bit of a shock to him. He’s not a tiny kid, but that first time you get punched in the mouth it’s always a bit of a shock, but it does seem like since the new year he’s really been doing bits for the side.   Great to see so many Blades singing Doyle’s praises too. I never really thought he was good enough to stick at City, which is a bit sad given his grandfathers (Mike Doyle and Glen Pardoe) both played for City. Would’ve been a great story for him and the club for him to kick on and stick here.
Doyle has been well regarded in the past too, and got some first team minutes back when he was like 18/19, but I think that despite the fact he’s City through and through, he wasn’t good enough for the side.   I do hope that McAtee can reach his best thorough, because he always seemed like he had “it.”
Rooney is struggling at DC United big time..
And now he's just an angry old man. Like seriously everytime he's on the news it will be because he's angry at something
If 95% of your students fail, the problem lies not with the students.
Those who can, do; those who can’t, teach.
A lot of what Ferguson did certainly wasn’t teachable, and may well be why his devotees have struggled. He was the club, in a way very few managers ever get to be (orobably only Wenger and Shankly get close in England) and managed by sheer force of personality a lot of the time, and that is not something you can just pick up and take to Valencia.
Artera has kinda shown it at times, no?
Sounds like he's Demon-Headmastered you
> with the gap no more apparent in the CL.  > they continuously floundered in Europe, tactically they were just poor  Queiroz left United in 2008 and the club reached two CL finals in three years afterwards…
Small note, it’s Carlos Queiroz* (pronounced Kay-Rosh, Quiroz would be Kee-rosh)
Played at the biggest clubs in each league*, but sure go on. SAF is clear, hahah you're free to have a opinion, but you're wrong.
I think it all also greatly enriches Cruyff's already stellar legacy but Pep is also an innovator and has formed these managers more or less directly, is what I mean. Xavi is another one I forget though doesn't manage in the Premier League.
He did, maybe he plans to go to Villa next season and complete the set.
Great point, [here's the list comparing Aug 1, 2022 to today.](https://www.transfermarkt.com/championship/marktwerteverein/wettbewerb/GB2/plus/?stichtag=2022-08-01)  Back then, Burnley were 5th.
Will make sure we hammer 5 past Bristol City end of this month. Up the fucking gas
I mean, what else would you base the market value of footballers on?
It’s certainly not, you’ll get 100 mil just from promotion it’s certainly smart spending. Still, more than just a handful of championship clubs could afford.
I'm not for a minute discrediting the value and solid recruitment for a large net profit. But that Burnley squad is still more than likely the most expensive in the league. Indeed [transfermarkt](https://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/championship/startseite/wettbewerb/GB2) has us and Watford far and away from the others in terms of estimated squad value.  Still great business by the club though, and interested to see how they handle the Premier league. If we can do to the bottom half teams like we dealt with Bournemouth in the cup then it could be a decent season.
Patient and calculated possession is the future of football. The fact that he has a Championship side playing Pep ball is very impressive. But not only that, the players he brought in were identified to play that type of football well, like Ian Maatsen. Tells me he can successfully implement his style of football as well and identify players that will excel under his system.  I think it's hard to learn and adapt to the new, and to implement complex tactics especially with championship level players. I'm not saying Dyche is necessarily a bad manager, it's just easier to implement cross and inshallah, brexit ball, hard nose defending style of football than be able to explain and coach more complicated tactics.   Wtf do I know though, I'm just a commenter on reddit.
ahahaha fucking hell I've just cracked up at that, I was trying to remember the burnley bit but couldn't so nice one  Fucking funny films ahahaha
Nah that's for next season when we don't actually get back up

Is our great sporting striker bas dost not performing for you? We still love him in Lisbon
Das Booooot!!!
Loved that movie, gritty submarine drama
It's not just the Premier League, it happens in most European leagues and some others around the world tbh, and it's sometimes worse. Spain was dominated by Real/Barça for more than a decade, Juventus won 9 consecutive leagues, France was absolutely dominated by PSG, Netherlands is mostly Ajax vs PSV
>and there are certainly other factors that make their particular season impressive  The fact they looked like they were going down until they won 3 of their last 5 games the season prior to finish 6 points above the drop is one.   You'd have to be a newly promoted team and win it to top them imo.   >also the top 3 of the table being exclusively big six clubs didnt happen until the late 90s  It didn't, but Man United were every bit as dominant in the league as Man City have been recently, it was basically Man United competing with one other club every season for 2 decades. They won something like 13 of the first 20 PL titles.  I feel like the PL title picture has always been pretty bleak tbh.
That is some BS, but not B S.
"It's only a matter of time before they buy the right finisher"  Haha that's a good one! Good strikers come here to lose all of their talent.
I'm not sold on that, after watching Chelsea spend £2bn in 20 years under Abramovich and sign a grand total of 2 great strikers in that entire time period
It hasn't got worse for United. Since that first season under Moyes you haven't finished outside the European spots
Yeah and when was the last time you guys finished below 11th? That's where we are rn.
He's teribad
He wasn't really bad. Just got frozen out by Potter so tbh can't really even judge him on this season.
I looked at the team, the only player whose name I recognized is Christian Benteke. So not exactly surprised by this.
Isn't that more that DC United are just shit?
Precisely. While he was presumably joking, it's not exactly a flex when your students consistently fail.
I'm in no way an expert so could be wrong but from what I've seen this season arteta is just a little bit more direct on attack then pep has been. Pep loves to cycle the ball and have another go and while arteta does this too I feel that he always has the goal a little higher up his priority list. I think that peps caution prioritizes possession overall while arteta is pushing for chances. It's a nuanced difference but I think that peps absolute focus on possession comes from vast experience. He wants to avoid the painful games where the team dominates but ends up losing on the counter or through individual brilliance of an opposing player. As a result though he gets some games where play is cycled too much and no significant progress is made in the final third. I think that artetas system promotes beautiful and formidable football, but I wonder if it can withstand long-term pressure from the rest of the prem. I'm excited to find out
Sick reference bro
Yes they did but this is one of those ones where you need to have watched the football rather than pull out the stat from wikipedia. There was a clear gulf between United and the rest of the European giants in play style and everyone at the time knew it.  2011 especially, United had one of the easiest runs to the final anyone's ever had in terms of opponents, and Ancelotti inexplicably started an already shot and unfit Torres instead of Drogba in the semi which killed the tie for Chelsea in the only testy opposition they faced.   United reaching two more finals with the type of football they were playing is incredibly flattering compared to the actual gulf in quality.  United were dominated in both finals and I remember the mood and punditry before the matches, no one even considered they had 1% of a chance in the 2011 final.
Obviously your boner for SAF blinds you from the facts. Pep beat him head to head in a champions league final 😂
the 'danny ings' special
The Cornetto trilogy of claret and blue
Exactly.   So absolutely pissing the league after being the 5th favourte/highest value is a massive achievement
Your eyes? Opinions? Saying "here's the list" and presenting that as anything but just the opinions of one website is a bit silly.  The values on Transfermarkt are high *because* Burnley are flying at the top of the Championship.
Context is also a thing that exists...  > Would you say Bendtner was brilliant?  If I was talking about Danish strikers, maybe  > Would you say Stirling Albion are brilliant?  If I was talking about the Scottish League 2, yeah.  If I'm talking about Championship teams over the past 20 years, then yes, Burnley are brilliant  And my niece's painting may not be brilliant compared to classical artists, but she's 9 and it is brilliant. Don't view things as absolute descriptions, context is also important.
Jesus I hope a child never brings you a drawing
Okay. Played some very good football. What are you basing your preconceptions on?
The point is that you’re willfully missing the importance of context.   Just because someone says something is brilliant doesn’t mean it’s brilliant compared to the most brilliant thing ever. It’s brilliant within context.   Just like your comment where you said Foden is “amazing”. By your logic, you’re wrong for that because compared to the top players he isn’t amazing.   You’re being pedantic but can’t even follow the rules of your own pedantry. Weak.
Fair enough well argumented
You get knocked down  And you’re still down again.
Hatee hatee hatee ho!
Nah he scored the winning goal against us, to make our awfull situation even worse
Haaland would hardly be a novelty if Drogba had played for any other team.
But will they lose so much talent that you’re in the relegation battle? I hardly believe that. Chelsea will be back in European contention next year.
1990, as it turns out
Last time Chelsea finished mid-table they won the league the following season, and that season was arguably worse than this one.
He was just trying to make you fell a little better... it'll be all right. Not great, and might take a while, but it will be. Hang in there
Fucking hell, he's still playing?
They have Mateusz Klich from the Prem too but he looked absolutely shit by the end of his time here. Just like Benteke tbf
Yeah but you look at other teams and they have a bunch of nobodies as well.
We are.
Yeah it’s not a good look.  If 90% fail you suck at teaching the material.  *Looking at you, Junior year professor!*
Apart from it isn’t a “stat from Wikipedia”, is it? It’s a well known fact which makes you’re initial claim a load of nonsense.  You’re talking about United post-2008 like they were a Tony Pulis team or something…  Also, United beat Barca 1-0 over two-legs in 2008 getting men behind the ball and playing the way you’re criticising them for in 2009-2011.
What SAF did for football and for united, will never be replicated ever again. Hopefully I'm wrong. Pep Is a phenom, a excelente coach and one of the modern marvels of the game, but my man has only ever coached a CL caliber teams w/ huge budgets! And that honestly works against his legacy.
True. Although Burnley did buy some players and were 4th after the transfer window closed. Come December, they were 3rd. And they stayed there until April 1st. Burnley's market value was €97m on March 15 and then €132m on April 1st. That's an increase of 36%.  Nathan Tella increased from 4.5m to 12m. Brownhill from 9m to 15m. Beyer from 4m to 10m.   So in conclusion: Yes, their market value did increase due to their stellar performance. They were always a team fighting for promotion, but it's still a great achievement, no doubt about that.
I don't have the time to rewatch every single Burnley game this season so I can come up with my own transfer values for them and the watch all the other games as well, so I can compare them. That's why I provide the list from a very well known and respected site. Is it perfect and 100% accurate? Is it better than anything me or you could come up with? Almost certainly.
Think I'm gonna lay down some more
Oh, so he keeps scoring. Just one thing to say:  Siri, play Thuderstruck by AC/DC Bas Dost Version
I mean, you lost to a team that lost to Spakenb-  Oh.
Yes. In fact, my local club is in USL League One so I try to go up to DC every now and then to watch MLS. I had no idea he transferred to DC United and got treated to this [dogshit penalty](https://youtu.be/tdtwlg7HPco?t=237) and had my PTSD of his time with Liverpool triggered all over again
That’s a lie and a half. He was a regular starter and had a semi-public feud with Marsch while he was here. Would be flying under Gracia
>You’re talking about United post-2008 like they were a Tony Pulis team  Well yeah compared to the First Pep Barcelona side, a Pulis side might have had a better shot in the 2009 final - United and SAF were shell shocked by just how good Guardiolas team was and it was like watching men against boys. United were basically spectators for 90% of the match and might as well have not turned up.   There's a difference between parking the bus in 2008 vs a less disciplined Rijkaard side and getting trounced off the pitch because your Manager misjudged the opposition and assuming the same tactic might work. SAF didn't come to play football in 2009 and he left Tevez out in naivety hoping Park and his engine could make up for the critical loss of Scholes.
Pep promoted Barca B in his first season as a manager. Pep then won a treble in his second season ever with the first team. Since then he has been in such high regard that he's one of the few who would be completely trusted at any of the top clubs. Him not ever managing a lowly club says nothing of his legacy.  His legacy is that he's been a huge success from day 1.
4th/5th favourites and then absolutely walking the league is a massive achievement. No two ways about it
> a very well known and respected site  lol
Man you fucking suck to talk to.
You definitely have no friends.
Yes, when teams are promoted they suddenly start playing very good football yes. And then they get beaten by Spanish teams.
It is pedantic, because what they’ve achieved this season is brilliant for the championship, regardless of their standing across England.   Pretending that because someone called Burnley’s achievement brilliant they’re saying they’re brilliant compared to City is asinine.   I agree with you that Foden is amazing. But by your logic, Foden *isn’t* amazing. You continuing to say that Foden is amazing is continuing to undo your shitty point.
Richmond? See you June 17th

Unbelievable choke
As a neutral, the last 10 minutes of this game has been just wow
Well Sevilla collapsed quickly after that a acuna belter
💀
perfect way to play a game man down and then lose it all in 4 minutes
That’s the Sevilla I know this season
Very nice.
Goncalo Paciencia, always good for a last minute header❤️
That’s a name I haven’t heard in a while
yikes
Porto on Porto crime
I knew from the first goal, they were gonna bottle it
Oh noooooooooo
And now he got a red kek
I knew from the 2nd goal, that Sevilla have just bottled it

No great goal tag?
cameras were zooming in on him on the bench and when he was warming up. almost scripted that he scored
Lens defeat Strasbourg at home with 2-1 in Ligue 1 and Gameiro scores the only goal for the away team. That exact thing happened 16 years and 2 months ago when Gameiro scored his 1st ever Ligue 1 goal. Today it was his 169th goal in Ligue 1 + LaLiga
A team that probably no one will miss tbh  Brought 0 fans to the game today and a few weeks ago I counted 7 of them during Cercle - Seraing...
good riddance
Their 12 fans will be devastated
The only reason they were losing at home but not getting absolutely fucking hammered was because of that awful pitch. Think only Genk and Gent put more than 4 past them, if the pitch was decent that would have happened every week
Don't ever come back although I will miss them taking points from Standard every time they played them
deserved
They were Seraing in the first division but now they’re Seraoutg
Can someone fill me in on what happened?
Hard to have fans when you're a few kilometers away from one of the biggest clubs in the country, but yeah, they're unprofessional (the game vs Antwerp attests to that) and just overall bad at football
Bad team, lost games
Liege is not a small city though,  We have Club Brugge at the exact same location and we still average more than 400 away fans
RFC Liege would bring more tbf.  Nobody will miss Seraing.
Oh so they’re just shit and nothing else. Thanks I just thought they could have been some controversy surrounding them as it’s really early in the season for this.
Cercle is a stable of Belgian football with long history, could say the same about USG in Brussels, but in Liège, there's no other historical club in the whole region that could rival Standard, RFC Liège is historical but has become irrelevant and is mostly a second team for some after Standard and Seraing is just a bad and irrelevant club that managed to play two seasons in the top flight and will go back to obscurity again, not hard to understand the lack of fans
theres only 2 games left in the regular season for the Belgian league, so it's not even early really
I witnessed the great Seraing with Wamberto and Edmilson in the 90’s. They were kinda legendary. Even played in Europe.
Damn my Belgian league knowledge is elite…  Seriously though thanks for educating me.
That was a different club with the same name and merged with Standard in the 2000s
The less you know about the Belgian league, the better for your own sanity tbf
I know and it was a failed attempt to recreate that team.
Too bad in those 15 mins I’ve become a certified STVV ultra.

There's a ridiculous amount of football every single year, and things just blend together or are outright unremarkable - but that's one of the few games I very distinctly remember. Absolutely incredible ending.
In 2013, Malaga FC almost reached the semi-finals of the Champions League, had it not been for BVB. The steep rise was followed by a deep fall. An investor was responsible for both.  **Lightning struck near Malaga in April 2013, first three times. Then twice.**  In the first case, it can even be taken literally. The Andalusians had scored a rather fortunate 0-0 against Dortmund in the quarter-final first leg of the Champions League and travelled to San Sebastian before the second leg in Westphalia. The plane was struck by lightning three times and had to make an emergency landing in Bilbao. They continued their journey by bus, losing the league match 2:4. As if the bad omens were not enough, coach Manuel Pellegrini learned of the death of his father before this match. The Chilean travelled home for the funeral.  And then, yes then, lightning struck Dortmund at Malaga. Marco Reus and Felipe Santana's late goals in the second leg made it the craziest comeback in the top flight since Barcelona. 2:3 after 2:1, Andalusian impotence in perfection. Or simply a "historic cruelty", as the Marca wrote. A caesura in the club history of the "Boquerones", the anchovies, as the club is called because of the regional speciality.  Yet the future around the "Rosaleda" had looked so rosy. In the stadium with the illustrious name "Rosengarten", illustrious players' names suddenly started to appear. Whereas at the start of the 2010/11 season the regulars were still called Jesus Gamez, Kris Stadsgaard, Apono or Seba Fernandez, a few months later they were Martin Demichelis, Julio Baptista (winter 2010/11 additions), Ruud van Nistelrooy, Santi Cazorla, Jeremy Toulalan or Joaquin (summer 2011). Later, Javier Saviola and Roque Santa Cruz also found their way to the Costa del Sol. They were joined by a teenager whose extraordinary skills sent the entire Spanish football world into raptures: Francisco Roman Alarcon Suarez, or Isco for short.  Malaga had wrapped itself in new chic robes, only the appropriate catwalk was still missing. But he was getting closer and closer: still 17th in 2010, already eleventh in 2011, then fourth in 2012 - Champions League!  But how did it happen that a club without a single major trophy in its cabinet suddenly found itself competing for the biggest one of all? And then crashed as brutally as someone slipping on an anchovy on the steep, breakneck stairs at the Rosaleda?  **Buying frenzy and empty promises**   It is once again the story of the rich investor who buys a new toy, eventually loses interest in it and then lets it rot in the corner. In May 2010, Abdullah Nasser Al-Thani, a member of the Qatari royal family, bought Malaga for 25 million euros, taking over the liabilities of 70 million euros at the same time. What followed was the aforementioned shopping spree, and Spain's largest youth academy with ten pitches and a new arena with up to 70,000 spectators was to be built on the picturesque Costa del Sol. The new name, however, would not have sounded quite as flowery as Rosaleda. It would have been "Qatar Stadium".  The "full-bodied announcement", as "Malaga Hoy" wrote in December 2010, was soon followed by no action. The desert money ran out, Malaga suddenly could no longer pay the salaries. Santi Cazorla fled to Arsenal FC in 2012, but with a transfer fee of 19 million euros he once again brought money into the coffers. Successful manager Fernando Hierro apparently also suspected bad things - the Real legend resigned in August 2012. In December of the same year, Malaga received mail from UEFA. The Andalusians were banned from the 2013/14 European Cup season for breaches of Financial Fair Play.  **Gündogan on cloud nine, Al-Thani accuses racism**  So if the Blue and Whites had actually won the Cup in 2013, they wouldn't even have been able to defend it. Or would UEFA have caved in after all, had the underdogs managed the big coup?  But the facts speak a different language anyway. For Ilkay Gündogan, the match was one of the "most beautiful moments in my life". For Malaga, a goal in which four Dortmund players, including the scorer Santana, were offside, was the final nail in the coffin. Al-Thani was furious after the match, even calling the incident "racist". They simply did not want to see his team in the semi-finals, he tweeted. However, he preferred not to mention that Malaga's goal to make it 2-1 had also come from an offside position.  The downfall now took its course. In the summer of 2013, successful coach Pellegrini left the club for Manchester City, and many stars did the same. Crowd favourite Isco moved to Real Madrid, also in 2013.  Al-Thani experienced all this from afar. The aloof sheik showed his face in Malaga maybe once a year - he gave his first official press conference in June 2016. By then, the club had long since sunk back into mediocrity. Then, in 2018, the time had come - it was off to League Two for Malaga. "Al-Thani, get lost quick," chanted the fans in the stadium. But he wasn't even there - as he always is.  **How low can Malaga go?**  Malaga is still in the 2nd division. Emphasis on "still". With eight matchdays to go, the Andalusians are eight points behind a non-relegation place. Three coaches have been worn out this season, compared to ten in the past five years. Since February 2020, the Boquerones have been led by José Maria Munoz, a court-appointed administrator. Al-Thani and his three sons Nasser, Nayef and Rakan, who are on the board, were deprived of their power by an injunction because of ongoing proceedings for abuse of office and money laundering. According to an audit, the family owes the club seven million euros.  However, they and their lawyers did not even appear at the trial. The judge announced that she would try to find the sheikh from Qatar through international administrative assistance. Another hearing in the "Al-Thani case" is scheduled for 21 April.  It is grist to the mill of all those who follow the entry of investors with a shake of the head. They will finally clap their hands over their skulls when they hear that recently the head of Qatar Sports Investments and PSG boss Nasser Al-Khelaifi deposited his interest in buying Malaga.  Incidentally, in 2021, exactly eight years after the Dortmund game, Al-Thani felt called upon once again to tweet about the match in obituary style. "9 April 2013, the day football was dragged through the mud by an institution called UEFA."  But on the Costa del Sol they have a different opinion about who really damaged football in Malaga.  Translated with DeepL
Based.
Cascarino earned herself a definite starter role over baltimore lol
We love a comeback
So glad she was effectively exiled from the team to cater to the whims of Diacre. Mercie Hervé!
And Diacre refused to call her up
Neither will start when Diani is back
Already a goal late lol, good game so far
Let's go

Fair play to Burnley on that one, after we scored the momentum swung in their favour. No complaints here. Also if it was a Boro fan throwing at players I don't condone that
Mcnair is shocking
Sheesh that celly to his old club lol
Boro defence is horrid, Carrick has been working a miracle
Awful defensively from McNair just following Barnes to ruin the offside line
Hey. Good
Streamja still broken
It had to be the Dyche old boys doing it!
Boro moaning about a clearly onside goal...
There’s always idiots in fanbase, not much you can do
My reaction in 2015
Made one appearance then got injured i think. Bit of an odd celebration to be honest. Not sure what that one was about
He only made 1 appearance on loan tbf
He’s not playing our best defender, I love Carrick obviously but he isn’t blameless
If we beat Boro and help you get promoted, it's only fair we win the Championship, yeah? As a reward?
Glad it’s not just me.
I can agree with that. Just lose on Monday please
You can do it without our help pal I believe in you

Lmao that's career ending stuff
Doesnt get more Brazil than that
Chelsea have already bid 200 million dollars
I see R9 has still got it
That's a big ball boy.
r/absoluteunits
Big boy knew he'd done him a peach
i love me some ballboy shithousery i dont even know why; maybe ever since Hazard kicked that kid.
Game's not gone
That'll show them!
Madrid sign 15 year old R9 prodigy for 50 million
Sort of thing you love if your club does it, but then are incandescent if done against you.
Hazard is on his way
After a 1-1 draw playing away, Salgueiro ended up winning at the penalty shootout. After 34 penalties taken overall (!): Salgueiro 14x13 Náutico.
Hazard wants to be(at) him
lol, fair play.  Get your 15 seconds, guy!
Hahaha, his (not so) little beaming face at the end 😆
When did Hazard leave Madrid?
give him a contract.
That walk of shame back is the best part.
First Class shithousery!
King
R9 has still got it!
Bammmm
GK: How can he slap!
Cleannn
That is fucking hilarious.
Is he a ball boy because he is round?
Is ‘ball boy’ describing his appearance?
The ball boy is actually a “ball” boy. 😂
r/absoluteunits
Doh!
Fucking legend!
My friend knows the Jogo Bonito
Tekkers
Kevin De Brownie at it again.
Lol you gotta love my hometown
O
Madrid contract inbound
For the goalkeeper, not the ball boy 🤣
Lol he's so angry about it after
Lacked some dancing afterwards tbh
Even Brazilian chonky bois are good at the game. Joga Bonito indeed.
The fact that he's overweight somehow makes it better
Sorry no stray dog, not Brazil enough.
For the keeper.
Hazard's fist clenches...his foot twitches...
The boy looks 30 years old.
Dude's the ball AND the boy
Ballman
It's always the biggest guys who goes for these and usually they are so good technically too.
https://i.redd.it/vda7vdnle2d61.gif
I get the jokes but Brazil is going through an awful nutrition crisis, people are literally starving whilst being extremely obese and it’s only getting worse.
The keeper missed the replacement ball that the ball boy threw in his spot. The ball boy actually did a favour to the goalkeeper and saved him from wasting his time. And he did it in style
Damn don’t see incandescent used very often. Nice one.
https://youtu.be/Nm4vxE5xY_k
An off-duty cop as well
Lol I wish, the ball boy will be landing in London tomorrow morning!
Ball man just doesn’t have the same ring to it
Tbf we don't call them "ball boys" here.
Lmaooo played 8 a side with a proper big lad. Beautiful technician, played the game with such sexiness I’m not even joking. He was like peak Bergkamp in the box with the strength of Akifenwa. After the match 15 people came to him, rose him over our shoulders and flung him in the air like the groom at his post wedding dance floor
>  starving whilst being extremely obese  [Hmm](https://media.tenor.com/C3lj14Kch6sAAAAC/biden-confused.gif)
Wouldn't it be "malnutritioned" rather than "starving"? Not trying to point you out wrong, genuinely asking.
Makes sense. Brazil seems to love copying everything that sucks about the US.
I thought incandescent means shiny or something
In sandals and cargo shorts
But it's very descriptive of the situation.
BALL MAN! Defender of the net man! Champion of the sun 🌞
Mb lol, meant malnourished
No yeah, you’re right, that’d be more appropriate of a word
malnourished
Incandescent comes from Latin, originally meaning to glow white, as in to be white-hot. You know it from incandescent lamps - the old incredibly inefficient type of bulbs which are just glass with a tungsten wire, and it emits light by heating up the tungsten wire until it glows from the heat.
you might be thinking of iridescent
I think it basically means lively or stong emotional. I'm not sure I have ever used it before but it just felt right.
The balls on this man
You've probably been using it wrong... It means something is glowing hot (hence old style light bulbs with a filament being called incandescent lighting). Its really only commonly used to describe anger or outrage, I wouldn't refer to someone who was experiencing strong emotions of sadness or happiness as incandescent for example.
It’s more like “aflame” than lively. Angry to the point of explosion or bursting into flames.

Choo Choo Choo! All aboard the Chuba train!!!
Equals out our offside goal I guess.
The officials are having a poor game  Classic EFL
I mean, come on... Good pen though.
Soft pen, but good for the game!
Utter chaos since half time
That’s some shocking decision
Refs are shite what's new, still a very winnable game
Harsh call, don't let sky hear that though... Can't allow a bad word against the golden boy's team.
God that’s harsh
How is that a pen but the Brownhill one isn't? 😂😂
Game on bois, who takes the tickets?
Exactly what I said, honours even now
Very soft. Not complaining like.
I felt like that when Sane dived for a penalty in the 2-2 draw at the Riverside monkaW
Man has receipts lmao
The link doesn't seem to be working for me. Not sure why. That being said, high-key considering dropping money to see this team play come June in Australia and New Zealand. I love them

miss you baby
Utrecht changed players in four different breaks, none of them being HT. Was one of them some concussion protocol thing or whatever? Or will they lose by default because of it?

Yea, concussion protocol. 2 forced substitutes in the first half.

they're staying up lads
Great header, and the sequence of play leading to the corner was nice too. Dmitrovic with a pin point long pass and Acuña with a superb one touch control  Football doesn't have to be so complicated lads
14 goals scored in all competitions for him, is probably in the best form of his life right now
He is him.
I hear Manchester United are looking for a striker
He is back
Is streamja not working for others?
Link doesn't work for me again, IDK
Link is dead ya cunts. Get on it. Upload mirrors you lazy bastards
Mendilibar the magician at a club that isn't broke lesgo
What about the 20/21 season? He scored many then
I hear they're looking to get their asses beat on Thursday :D
You are one grateful customer
If they really want a Sevilla Striker we can send them Rafa Mir.
Not with Casemiro and Eriksen back
Sometimes you gotta be a Karen to keep them on their toes. Most of the time I'm nice I swear.
It's Sevilla in Europa League baby
They have no hope against Fernando and Rakitic buddy
I’m not your buddy friend
Judge Dredd wants his robot back. In all seriousness, fucking great job getting Burnley back up. He's proven to be a superb manager, and Chelsea will be glad to have him
As usual some prick ruining things.  Riverside has been absolutely bouncing. Exciting football on show (some suspect defending). And some prick throws coins.
Shit decision, boo-urns
Efl refs taketh and giveth
Sign. Tella.   That has to be objective #1 in the Summer.
Maatsen has no sense of the run behind him at the moment.  Just 10 minutes lads. Tighten up!
I'm just here to see Kompany making himself a Burnley legend, if all goes well.
Not been good enough in the final third in the first half, don't get me wrong from the get go I don't/didn't expect to win this game. I also don't want to lose the game because of the linesman's incompetence
Boro have pressed us really well in that first half, hopefully Kompany can sort out our playing at the back. Other than that I can't complain, let's score a few more though.
I'm just going to say, I've never seen Aaron Ramsey and Jamal Musiala in the same room at the same time.
2-1 Burnley.
Gotta love it
That Burnley keeper is huge.
Proper pl quality game
We got away with one Lenahan should be off and Burnley should be 2 up
Eh. Such is life.   We got an offside goal, we missed out on a pen. A soft but by the book pen for Boro.  We have to be better now.
Dude missed an open goal
That burnley keeper is sus
Muric man.  He has great moments, but it might be best to not have him around just for the sake of the cardiac condition of Burnley fans.  The man gives out too many heart attack moments
Seemed pretty soft pen to me   Great pen by Akpom tho, unstoppable!
Have some shame, Archer
Obafemi understanding his current role in the squad well there I guess. See out the game by any means necessary, but I hate the kicking the ball out of bounds BS
WELCOME BACK BURNLEY
Burnley should be 3 up with chances they’ve missed here but they’re making some little defensive slip ups too.
How's that a penalty
Burnley too honest. Brownhill goes down and we 100 percent get a penalty. Tella goes down and Boro are down to ten men. Nothing given for either and refs wonder why players dive.
Keeping the “Hack” in Hackney.
Choo Choo Choo! Justice is served
Don't think the officials have got any of the big calls right so far.
Well who knew Carrick’s side would be diving swines. So soft.
wtf was that challenge
Is this more or less Burnley's starting XI or are they missing any key players?
Both keepers are making me nervous, Steffan with a lucky escape
Brilliant leap and forgot to head it.
THERE WE FUCKING GO
ASHLEY BARNES BURNLEY LEGEND!  Back in the fucking prem. What a season
Don't put that evil on us!
He got what he deserved. If he can't take it then dohe shouldn't run up the touchline antagonising the fans.
In my head you guys will pass him back to us as we go past you down to the Championship and he will carry us next season.   Realistically he will sign for you and go on to be a success in the Premier League with Kompany at the helm.  I've always resented how little game time he got at Saints, watching him in the U21 was always exiting with his play style and tenacity.
Fancy swapping them for the last couple games of the season?
Just wish he'd be as commanding as his size suggests
>Man  It's difficult on the Tella one, he was being fouled but also managed to shrug off the man, I'm sure he backed himself more to score there and to make it 2-0 than to get Boro down to 10 men.
Man it was just too good of a chance to go down. He had to shoot it
Tactical foul m9
Our CB spot alongside Beyer is being shared by 3 other cb's the last 3 games. Benson once back at full fitness is on a par or better than Tella or Zaroury. Jay Rod arguably better than Barnes but been injured since the start of the year. Jack Cork is a good option when we need 2 holding cm's.
Dont worry Lampard free in the summer.
What? Gudmonson?   It was Roberts that was celebrating the goal and shushing you no?  Also, come on now. There is no excuse for throwing shit on the pitch
We can do it like Jay Rod.  Jay started with us, had his most successful period with you then came home. A nice little reverse seems fair but that means we need a few seasons of Tella I'm afraid
Atleast he looks good at claiming crosses.
That's impressive then as I wouldn't rate this squad very highly necessarily, unless, a lot of those players have improved significantly from last season.  I don't feel like it's as good as Fulham last year or even our squad from 3 years ago but I might be wrong.
Wash your mouth out please!!
Whoever it was. Thought it was CR. Collateral damage so blame him.
Barnes is definitely having a twighlight same with an injury free Gudmundson, where as Roberts and Brownhill have benefitted to playing more to their style.

Everyone is focusing on his left foot, which indeed cleanly takes away the ball. However his right foot is planted on the foot/ankle of his opponent. Second yellow might feel harsh, bit I think it's correct.
Video isn't loading for me, IDK
Can be a yellow? Yes. Is it harsh? Aboslutely.
Now that's crazy
Disgrace
Game's gone
What a donkey, 2nd yellow after 19 minutes.
That is fucking harsh.
you what
Wtf how is this a second yellow?
how
am I blind or why was that a foul? he doesnt even touch him... and where is fkn VAR?
Lmao
Two soft yellows. RFEF is a joke
So he obviously doesn’t step on his foot on purpose. Man, I don’t know. If I were a ref, I’d have a hard time giving a second yellow for that.
Thanks for pointing that out, I watched that 5 times and didn't see him standing on his ankle till you pointed it out. Great catch by the referee too.
Yeah it's not a scandalous decision at all. At first I was sure it was going to be overturned since he got the ball, but then I saw the stamp on the Celta players' foot  You can say that either of the yellow were slightly harsh so early into the match, but not wrong
Broken for me too on most posts
Watch it again
Stands on his foot. Clear in the final replay.
VAR can't intervene on yellows I think
It's clear as crystal that Swarovski were the better side today
After our big chance earlier this was painful
**Mirrors / Alternative Angles**      *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/soccer) if you have any questions or concerns.*
that's offside m9, lino blind or what?
Had to be him.  If this is the goal to take us up...then it just had to be him
The moment you want VAR in the championship, was nowhere near a goal in my books. Barnes shoulder was offside
So if Burnley win here they go up, right ?
Looked offside to me, but if we're going to get shafted by decisions let it be in this fairly pointless match.
It would be poetic for barnes to be the one to send us to the premier league as a final send off almost
Welcome *back to the prem  Edit: streamja fucked for anyone else?
he heard you talking shit
I'm the first one to shit on the officiating in England but that would be a complete guess to the human eye
Theres been massive doubts about his ability to play at this level most of the season, so he deserves this if it takes us up. He’s already a Burnley legend anyway and this would cement it even more   Expecting Boro to score though so it’ll take more than this
Agree tbh. Shouldn’t have stood. But by the same, Burnley should’ve had a pen not long after.
correct
Yeah mathematically promoted, but honestly even if they lose all remaining games they're going up still lol
Think it was offside, but we also had a nailed on pen waved away 2 minutes later.  Swings and roundabouts
If/when you do go up do you think you'll be looking to get a new first choice striker or would you be happy with Foster/Obafemi/J-Rod?
That wasn't a pen tbh. Brownhill goes down way too easy for me there.
Nice one. Happy for Kompany too.
Football doesn't work like that really, but I get the point.  Goal doesn't get scored, pen chance doesn't happen etc.  It's like when everyone brings up the Lampard goal v Germany and says "Well, Germany battered you 4-1 anyway".  Well yes, but that's because Lampards goal didn't count and changed the way we played.  Same thing with the offside goal here.   However yeah, it does tend to "even itself out".  Just wish Champ refs/linos weren't so shit.

Polska gurom
This is clearly a tactic by Benfica "we pretend to be shit so Inter will underestimate us".  Amateurs, we're doing the same since 2 months
Nice of Porto to let Benfica use their Lisbon stadium 364 days a year
Bring Barcelona, bring Juventus, bring any team you want. We will play eye to eye against anyone and... Oh excuse me Porto, of course we will keep our salão de festas open.. We can also provide free water..  Every year the same.. Either we are playing like gods or playing like shit.. Porto will make us tremble
Fucking pathetic. Porto deserved to win. Nothing more to say
Porto totally deserved it. Embarassing game, especially the first half. Hope we can learn from this and bounce back against Inter. Losing against our rivals, at home and with such poorvexhibition is frustrating.
well deserved win although it is impossible to win the league in my opinion.
The typical story of renewing with a coach that's doing great and then suddenly turn into shit.   Hopefully this was just a one off and we bounce back against Inter.   Grimaldo looks like he's already thinking about his new club and we need to stop playing Aursnes as a winger. He does the job when we don't have other options, but when we literally have Rafa + Neres available it's dumb to bench one of them.
Braga really fumbled the bag by not beating Porto. That chance wasted by Pizzi is gonna fuck them in the race for 2nd place. Now they are forced to beat Benfica in Lisbon in order to stay 2 points behind Porto and far away enough from Sporting (assuming that they win every other game). At the same time, a Braga win is gonna leave Benfica only 4 points ahead of Porto, and they also still have to play Sporting away. That combined with the UCL is gonna put an insane pressure on Benfica's team.
Deserved win. We have to turn up against Inter now.
Parabéns ao Porto, fez mais por isso.
So there's a chance
Porto could've won with an even bigger margin. They had a big chance in the second half. Had a 3 on 1 counter attack which they couldn't finish.
only positive is that these cunts need to prove something on tuesday  saying its embarassing is still giving too much credit, it was coming from the last couple of games
Benfica is always this shit against Porto at home. Fuck this peasant mentality
22 Benfica Vs Porto games played in Benficas stadium. 11 of those ended in a Porto win.
porto must be top 10 most annoying/frustrating teams to play against. that was some elite time wasting (and good defending)
FLASH NEWS🚨PORTO WINS AGAINST BENFICA 🚨
Now that the easiest game of the calendar is done we need to focus and keep fighting until the end.
Who needs to have sex when you can just stay indoors and spread your legs to Porto instead?
Can someone tell me when the game starts? Haven't seen Benfica yet
Didn't expect anything else. Hey, at least it may calm people down before the Inter game, might do everyone some good, as long as we don't start losing points to Chaves and company after this.
Can't wait for Benfica to start playing. Maybe by Tuesday
Traditions are to be kept at our party venue. Season’s still over but it feels good to beat “Super Benfica”
They pretty much already won the league, BUT GOD DOES IT FEEL GOOD TO HUMBLE THEM!
Good to see us win here, nothing shuts up Benfica fans quite as quickly as Porto winning at their home ahaha, too bad it's basically impossible for us to go for the title
I love Taremi but sometimes his feet are not as good as his brain.
Our brains werent switched on today. Making silly mistakes and couldnt do the basics.
Pathetic
Congrats for advancing through to the semi-finals, Internazionale. The usual end season downfall starts here.  And there were Benfica fans asking to get Porto in the Champions League. We would get battered, as always
Best Portuguese team winning and making me win my bet as expected , they usually beat benfica the odds were weird lol
Im gonna buy some rope. Anybody want some?
Porto look like a very well drilled team, enjoyable to watch
Hopefully this puts our boys back to reality. We have been flying high lately and getting results with poor play.   I think we put in a good result against Inter with the quick turnaround.   Hopefully Bah isn’t hurt too badly.
Anyone willing to make a summary of the match?
Artur Soares dias is getting a bonus ❤️
Mate I don’t think we’re pretending
You guys should sign Sérgio Conceição, he would make magic in Serie A
Yo also pretend to be shit so Inter underestimate you?
How was Otamendi?
Still possible in my opinion, we still have Braga and sporting. If we lose/tie to both, league is wide open
Fine margins. If you didn't get the red in Porto you would have won that game and been a point behind
>Braga really fumbled the bag by not beating Porto.   Same could be said the other way around... Evanilson wasted a clear chance to put Porto up front late in the match.
Theres still Gil Vicente away too. They made Porto and Sporting lose points...
Benfica have been the best team in the league this year, but here's hoping they feel the heat and crumble. At this point the title is theirs to lose.
blue shirt scares Benfica, you got the adventage
Only 11? Seems like you always beat us away. The only recent home win I can remember is the one with the Seferovic goal
Literalmente a vossa puta. Espero que esta mentalidade de tremer em jogos contra o Porto acabe
Top-tier shithousery is acquired after facing Atletico de Madrid 2 years in a row. It rubs on you.
Top 1 probably
You summed it up. Whistle to whistle you humbled us. We looked like we had 5 less players all game and you looked like you had 5 more players. I would have trash talked if we won so I have to praise if we lose. Congratulations. More than deserved win.
Exactly what I was thinking man, Benfica fans getting humbled gives me such nice feelings deep inside
How many games left?
Well, i think no one enjoys losing against their rival at home lmao
please for the love of god dont lose to merda
>The usual end season downfall starts here.  Hopefully. ☻
I don't think it's that, I feel like this one is more the typical Benfica after a international break this season, super uninspired, even against Rio Ave we played like shit. Hopefully we can turn things around next game against Inter. Even so, I believe both Benfica and Porto will lose points until the end of the season, Benfica still has some tough games ahead and Porto has been playing worse against smaller teams this season. In my opinion we will still win the league, but it would be better if we didn't have to fight so hard in the last few games.
The odds were not weird. We are playing shit and benfica wins every game. We have so bad wings that the discussion for where to put the airport should have ended long time ago.  I was not even watching the game because i already put in my mind that we would lose by 2 or 3.
If only they played like this every time
Super uninspired play by Benfica who scored first in the first opportunity they had. Porto always with more pressure and wanting to win. After Benfica was down we barely did anything to change the result, so fair result in the end.
Common Porto W in Lisbon.
Porto won.
Lol. If you want to blame someone, blame the apathic players and manager and the even worse fans on the stands. Imagine putting this one on the ref
Here we go
LMAO
No shame?
His refereeing was quite consistent.
Trust Inzaghi
LEAVE US ALONE
Our best player, the only that didn't deserve this shit.
Good. Hey has been really consistent.
I think Benfica is still going to lose more points, but 7 games (I think?) is a very tight margin
If my house had wheels it would be a truck!
Hopefully we don't play in the yellow shirts then
7 games left and they are 7 points ahead.
True, didn't enjoy it one bit when you guys did it to us at the beginning of the season lol
It's coming, man. Benfica big game choke incoming. Schmidt will turn out to be the german Rui Vitória and lose against the big dogs
I can see a breakdown happening here. The manager was nonexistent and we had no passion. I can't see us winning against Sporting tbh. The Classic is one of the biggest games we have every season and the mentality just isn't there. We had a little scare against Rio Ave that should've been enough to put us on alert for this game. But nope. We got the classic Benfica against Porto at home
I made bank as soon as the referee was confirmed, everyone knew it was gonna be him anyway. The odds kept rising for some reason but they didn't account for the Proença factor
2-1.
It's a shame there's no other referees anywhere ever
We’ll see, the team is going to be tested now. Idk why we played this game for a tie. Should’ve gone for a win. It is what it is, Good game man!
No, it would be a motorhome
Yeah I didn't enjoy the game tonight either for some bizarre reason. Must be a coincidence I guess
Noo you need to go lose in the final, its written in the stars.
🤨
You definetly lost because of the ref...
Cry some more, go on
Maybe they were accounting for the Luis Godinho and Tiago Martins on VAR.
I agree, but ASD can't be blamed here
I don't think I could survive another european final loss, but heck, I'll take it
Wiping my tears with the euros
I feel you buddy, aged double in the past 20 years..
Wtf? Euros? Tas todo queimado

Least uneventful Eredivisie match
I can't find a good stream, was Booth's bad?
Douvikas looking good this year?
No, I think he eyebrow was bleeding pretty bad. Most likely he will be back next match

Taremi went absolutely braindead for a second
Worst counter I’ve seen
Someone switched Taremi during the World Cup and sent someone else.
Think he has played a lot of minutes over the past few seasons. This with all the issues before and during the World Cup has had an effect. Even then, he scored you the winner today and has (I think) 24 goals and 12 assists so far this season across all competitions. On track to go over the 40 mark combined again. Tremendous.
Yeah, he got amazing numbers in the first half of season, but since January he only has 5 goals and 3 assists, and has a lot of wasted opportunities like this, he's collapsed incredibly this last few months
I think the team as a whole has collapsed slightly. Was always going to be hard with the players you have lost to maintain the top form that you had. I think this loss of form also coincides with Evanilson’s injury issues, they really did build a good connection with each other.  The chance tonight, he definitely should do better with, not arguing with that but strikers tend to blow hot and cold. Hopefully he picks up his form with what is left of the season.
Medina is the kind of guy I always want in my team
peak Lens goal, and it should count
had no idea kevin danso didn't speak french, or at least not fluently, very surprising to hear him bust out the english. turns out he spent his younger years in england and was with us as a child?!?!?
HELL OF A GAME, as in Dante should be narrating it.  Lecce playing out of their minds, we look utterly gassed, Hjulmand needs to be bought yesterday, Simeone got injured, Anguissa looks ready to retire, that own goal was something out of Milan last season in terms of luck, I have no idea how we can even dream of walking out of the pitch alive Wednesday.   #But it doesn't matter because it's -4. The four days of Naples.   DiLo complaining because the ref whistled before Politano could score is the attitude we need. Every point, every goal, every metric must be ground down.
An entire season of perfection and we end up playing like shit in the most important month of our history. I want to die
It is going to be interesting to see how Napoli play in the Champions League.  They do not look like what we have been used to this season.
It's so weird that Spalletti chooses to take off Lozano earlier than Kvicha. Chucky gets rest here and there alternating with Politano, but Kvicha barely gets any. Lozano was also performing solidly defensively, though everyone underperformed in general by a mile. They all looked so gassed, maybe apart from Di Lorenzo but he never tires.  Zambo and Lobotka, too. They looked jaded.
It’s funny how Lozano and Politano are never in form at the same time.
Pioli's luck is immense: first Osimhen and now Simeone, our man of destiny.  Congrats on the CL win Milan.   Also let Politano score FFS, fuck you ref.    Bombelè played decent I guess
If Napoli doesn't recover Milan would finish it in the first leg
Not cool move by the ref at the end.
well congrats to Milan I guess, if we play like this it's over by first leg
Lecce has been a tough place to play for every top team this season. Getting a win is a solid result, especially without Osimhen and Zielinski.
Not like I am super aware of the the depth terms of Napoli's squad, but seeing the comments about the team being gassed reminds me of how surprised I was before the Milan game, given that they kept playing the starters non stop.
I''ll take it
What's gotten into Napoli? Months of absolute perfection and now they can barely defeat Lecce
how many more wins for napoli to win it?
Honestly nuts how people be saying that Napoli are done and will bottle the league after losing a game and Lecce equalising with almost a whole half left to play
Do we have a replay of the final whistle? I had to stop watching and want to see what happened.
Napoli is done physically. They have walked on the pitch.  There is no way this team in this status without Oshimen nor Simeone can even came close to Milan in the first leg.  They are going out easily but I think they will win the scudetto no problem.
Garbage performance but hey we take those 3 points neverthless
napoli in horrendous form, i just dont understand what has gotten into the team
How is Umtiti doing?
Napoli get three points thanks to an own goal and still throw a fit at the ref for whistling during their attack, which wouldn't have changed anything anyway lol  ~~protect your balls Calabria~~
Let me use the famous quote: “If you cant bear me when I’m at my worst then you dont deserve me when I’m at my best”. Hehee relax guys it will be so boring if Napoli always go off the hook and destroy opponents by 3 goals difference.
Relax, I get that you don't know because you haven't won anything in decades, but winning even when you play like shit (specially when you play like shit) is the mark of a champion.
Keep faith my neopolitan brothers and sisters.
How long is osimhen out for ?
are both 100% out for next week?
Isn't Osimhen rumoured to be back for Milan?
Not super deep but we have a nice bench especially for serie a’s standards but we don’t have great depth in some key positions and Spalletti isn’t good at rotating the team
Bruh we have the most important game of our history coming up. It wasn’t a stellar performance but we got the job done.
we drew them at home too
Think they’re pretty safe to drop off a little in the league. Only need like another win or two to seal it. As long as they can turn up in CL
I think it's 4, assuming Lazio wins every game from now on. Napoli needs 12 points to secure it and everytime Lazio loses points, it's as if Napoli gains them. So yeah, it's theirs.
Comentator mentioned 12 points from possible 30 so damn near impossible to bottle this
Four. Three if Juve wins tomorrow.
They need 9 more points I think
Four
four
4 if Lazio wins and my calculations are right
No rest for core players + a lot of matches over winter period.
Napoli’s winter downfall has been delayed by climate change
Lack of victor,
You can understand the frustration when the ref allowed Lecce to have 2 corners after stoppage time but wouldn’t let Napoli score on an empty goal.
This so much. Championships aren't decided by the 4-0 blowout victories, they're won by all of the bad matches where you win with a goal difference.
Exactly, you could be us with all the lost points on top of playing like shit.
This. Most title-winning teams in competitive leagues usually end up winning gritty matches by the end of the season. That was the case for Leicester in their miracle year
Don't know
Never underestimate Napoli superpower of bottling stuff at the end of the season lol
This. Spalletti ruined the team by making 0 changes in already won matches.
Sure but in this case, the game was over and in favor of Napoli, why collectively go mad at the ref lol
Will remember our XAV1 ball 1-0s for years to come
Spalletti has a well established track record of being horrible with rotating. However I think Napoli are too far ahead now for it to have any serious negative implications.
that's like the best thing of this match  they showed they at least care and try every minute they are on the field  they still sucked and had a terrible performance, but at least the spirit is there, and it's that spirit that brought Napoli on such big margin so far
Denying goals is never cool, it's in the essence of the game to have as many goals scored as possible. I think it wasn't a good move by the ref, seeing how reluctant he was to whistle while Lecce was pushing. It's not only about the end result.
Because if he isn’t gonna allow Napoli to score on an open gol he should have blown the whistle 30 seconds earlier
Not in the league but in the ucl
Liverpool fans should be tried at The Hague for selling us on what a good player Origi is.
Why even celebrate and waste time if you know it hit your arm lmao
time to learn chinese origi
If Origi didnt play there would be literally no difference
No sane manager that fights for CL spot would play Origi, but here we are
I feel like a front two of Colombo+Daniel Maldini could do much better than Rebic+Origi
Empoli getting 4 points at San Siro.  Bigger than la Viola in my book
Empoli are so fucking harmless in attack
congrats Pioli, you dit it once again
It’s crazy how dogshit Inter and Milan can be and then they’re still both playing in CL
Are they resting Giroud and Leão for CL?
How is Origi so slow wtf
whats going on with ibra is he just a fossil on the bench now
Is there anybody who actually likes this Milan kit?
Heeeey we have that chant too. Wait does Milan have a PAOK inspired chant too? Cause ours doesn’t have any ooooh in it. The chant is 100% a rhyme. Still. It’s nice
Never a pen
That would have been a crazy decision
[Origi in this thread](https://media.tenor.com/vDnVbNdoCisAAAAC/bow-arrows.gif)
The commentator on BT sounds so fucking exasperated
What a shit game
Come on Milan, you can't possibly win 0-4 away to Napoli and then fuck up against Empoli at home?!
Origi is useless
I would rather see Sulley Muntari or Djamel Mesbah up front.
Wow this game is an absolute eyesore
How long will it take Pioli to sub Origi and Rebic? Its like he doesnt want to win
FFS get Origi off the pitch
He really played Origi and Rebic for 70 minutes.
Giroud has 43 pace and 85 finishing how does he do it  Edit: handball 🤧
No man of God, despite Giroud being so sexy
Lmao. Life is pain rn for Milan fans. Also how come he didn’t go to check it and just went with the var. weird.
Timori yellow after game hilarious
I'm 100% confident on an Empoli win
I hope origi won't be with us next season, he is dead weight. I was hopeful for him but no
That was painful to watch
Rebic wont score even if he was the only one on the field
Divock Origi.
This ref lol
What's the point of Onigiri?
That correct VAR intervention absolutlely killed Milan, because since then they have been poor.
Milan-Empoli was wild in the reverse fixture, only fitting this one has a dramatic ending too
Haha Milan just can't
This game should've had had like 20 mins extra time, there's barely been any actual play in the second half
HAHA PURE IL CORAGGIO DI CELEBRARE HAHAHA
Great origi out, now milan can play 20 minutes 11 vs 11 since the donkey is out where he should be
LORD DIVOCK
Does anyone remember the match between Barcelona vs Milan at the 2012 CL?  Do you consider it one of the most entertaining matches within the Champions League history?
Competition between Milan players of who can shoot worse is heating up
From the looks of it Bennacer is the one playing trequartista
How is de ketalarae or what’s his name for Milan? Did he turn out to be epic gamer or mediocre at best?
It hits his head, no penalty and good use of VAR
Always a boring game when opponents defend with their entire team. 🥱
Stupid sexy Giroud
The Duality of AC Milan
thank fucking god
I am done lol
What a pointless yellow from Satriano
I remember so many Liverpool fans were sayig Origi could score 20 goals in Serie A and for some reason I was actually lowkey optimistic.   But what a dud this guy's been. I'd unironically take Destro upfront instead of him.
They never saw him play for more than a few rate cameos, where he did pop up with important goals. But god is he shit.
He grew up in an era without VAR.
Worked for Udogie last season who scored with his arm, didn't celebrate as he thought goal would be disallowed but it wasn't
Chinese is the past, he should learn Arabic and start fast because its one of the hardest languages
Might even help Milan
They didn't even try, don't remember the last time there was a team with 0 intention in going forward, literally 11 men in their penalty box
Hopefully not next year
Yes, among others.
They’ll be all playing by 60’
Terrible strategy when they desperately need Serie A points and their back ups are Serie B level
Yeah, he's done. They announced this week he'll leave at the end of the season.
Took me a minute to even realize it was Milan
I like it tbh
Bought that kit this year in Milano actually. I love it
No.
Why they playing in that kit??? Not red black?
As promised in the Lecce/Napoli thread, you're here.  Are you also doing the Salernitana v Inter, Lecce v Napoli, and Milan v Lecce marathon?
Can you blame him? This match is absolutely dogshit. 0 shots from Empoli and 17 from Milan but they dont even look close to scoring
You expect anything more from that team?
Never let them know your next move
That sounds entirely in character. I mean you started with a dreadful team, this was always likely imo
Muntari had some bangers, tbf.
Describes watching Juve, Milan and Roma all season.
It's like offside, there's nothing to judge from him subjectively. Did he score with his arm? Yes. There's no reason for him to watch it as well
Because you can't score with a handball even if it's accidental, so it's an objective decision that doesn't require an off-field review for the referee to assess.
What does he have to check? Didnt even hit his head lool
Seeing Milan's lineup it's not unlikely.
Good luck selling him. He has a 3 years left on his expensive contract.
They dont deserve to win this game.
🤌🤌
The last sentence is wildly exaggerated, with the rest I agree
I agree with the general premise, but in this specific situation it's not wild for Giroud to have thought he scored legally with his shoulder. In the heat of the moment your senses don't work all that well.
Not even top 20 for me.
You come from the future?
So far haven't scored a goal. He will eventually get there. He have lots of talent. So for now, mediocre at best.
Huge flop
It is, but we've wasted like 10 mins already in giving and taking away penalties
Sadly, thats half the teams
You were saying?
Meanwhile its been 6 years with VAR
When they tried the play counter attack the Empoli play was always half as fast as the Milan defender
> They announced this week he'll leave at the end of the season.  Where was this announced?
So they can sell this kit
No just the two games. Both are an eyesore hehehe
Not at all. It's been dire.
Yeah I thought the procedure is different. Probably is but they didn’t do it for the sake of time saving cause added time
I think the procedure is to call him to see it anyway cause he has to have the final call but they skipped the thing to save time.
Yeah but I think the ref needs to check it with his eyes. The var needs to call you to see it not tell you what is and isn’t. I think that’s the standard procedure
Maybe he can go to Saudi league lmao
Oops missed the thread
Agreed, we need to be more direct
delete this before you jinx it
Bad habits die hard
Caputo isnt really known for his speed
Are you surprised? Did you think he was getting a new deal? He's 42 in a few months lol
You are not wrong.
Who could have seen that coming
Doesn't have to do anything with that
I dont think he has to have final call if the VAR tells him it's a clear handball
The Saudi's probably arent that stupid, but I'll let you dream 😄
hehe I know, but it was funny
You need to be more skillful and creative. You seem to have few ideas other than crosses into the box.
Great start to the weekend for the Roman teams. We can celebrate together for a rare change
I'm just asking to show me the announcement that he'll leave at the end of the season. Should be really easy to do if there is one, right?
You're replying to a different person than the one who made that statement. I don't google things for people who are too lazy to do it for themselves, but I also saw it reported.
I know you're not the same person, but since your comment doesn't add anything to my question or provide any useful info, I might as well ask you as well.  Because who in their right mind calls a rumor the same as an announcement?
Is that the hill you were looking to die on?  Clubs dont make official statements mid season that an expiring players contract wont be renewed. It just doesnt happen. What you're asking for doesnt exist.
> Is that the hill you were looking to die on?  There's no hill here to die on, because there's no ambiguity. It's simply pointing out the false claim.
You're weird, you know that right?  You could have just said 'this isnt an official statement' instead of all this performative question asking

That was genius from Aspas, a player that will never get the recognition he deserves because of the team that he plays for. He is 35 and only has 20 caps for Spain, criminal.
La Liga refs fucking suck. Every time I watch a game the ref ruins it with a terrible red card.
what a stupid yellow lol barely any contact and its he 100% dived
Qué barbaridad Acuña pero cómo ha hecho eso
Sorry mate I requested one from MatchThreadder just before I saw your post! Your template looks better, might as well let yours stay up!
This is keep away, not football.  0.1 combined xG is tragic
Holy shit!
Pafuera Gueye
0-0 confirmed with that red card
This is going to be a yellow card fest
(Sorry if they've mentioned this on commentary, I only just put the game on a few minutes ago)  Anyone know why Gabri Veiga isn't in the squad?
Did Tecatito get injured again?
Let's go let's go
The Sevillanos got tired
The other one was removed now
The first 20 minutes until the red card were very intense and end to end, obviously the red card is going to change the flow. If anything it's impressive that Sevilla can keep a good team like Celta to such few chances with 10 men, considering our defensive woes
I hope you still tuned in for the second half, that was great
Lmao
suspended   scroll down below the lineup   https://www.fotmob.com/match/3918215/matchfacts/sevilla-vs-celta-vigo
I have sad news for you
This aged well
Cheers!
Thanks, the site I normally use didn't have anything listed so wasn't sure.
One of the best games I've seen in some time.
Not sure at all what the fuck happened there but delighted with a point.
Now that's a scoreboard
4-4 games and Sunderland, good times.
Amad was fantastic as was Clarke.
Match of the season?
grit
It was an alright game I guess
We deserved a result with how hard they fought considering all the injuries
Same, it was the first championship game I've watched in a long time. I was sick and just put on some football to watch and what a game it was!
It’s made me feel sick.
Best competition
Sickos committee material
Not all heroes wear capes
Pitch looks pristine
What happened to the pitch? Goodness gracious.
Improvise, Adapt, Overcome.
Is there a sickos committee for soccer?
Random early round US Open Cup match, probably very literally a random local park

As much as constantly being relegated to this league is depressing, it’s an absolutely barmy party to be a part of.   You cant beat it
Sums up this season for us, moments of brilliance and moments of madness in equal measure. Credit to Hull, they kept fighting and deserved something from the game.   People will make a big fuss about this game being the end of our playoff hopes, but we’ve only won 1 in the last 9, so really those hopes ended a while ago. Still have to be pleased with how well we’ve coped given this is our first season back in the championship.  Also Amad Diallo is absolutely dynamite and I am already sad that he’ll be off at the end of the season.
great, now Boro Burnley is a guaranteed 0-0
The LAST moment of the game, what a silly penalty to give away with the final challenge of the match.  What a match! Most entertaining league in the world
Braindead from Ekwah
This game could only end this way.
Slater was crazy in attack today, 50 fucking thousand
What a game this has been.
Cant believe I missed this game because im babysitting XD
Best match of the championship season imo. End to end with some brilliant play and silly defending.  You can unclench now Sunderland/Hull fans
Gutted for sunderland but that was a nuts game and a tie is probably what was deserved for both sides
Incredible
Definitely penalty. Sunderland games have been very entertaining
Such a dumb challenge in the last seconds of the game
What a game. Lovely end to the game as a totally neutral fan.
Disappointing from our perspective as it could have given us a slim chance of playoffs but probably deserved given the nature of that game. Great watch regardless
I didn't watch the game, but I am rather invested because of Amad Diallo's loan to Sunderland, and I have a question: Did it warrant going to ~8 minutes extra time with only being +4 added originally? I would lose my head if the opposition had a penalty 4 minutes after the game should have ended lol.
Definite penalty. We dominated them. One of those days
I love this game, shagged by injuries, 3 centre forwards injured, youth team striker injured as well. we somehow score 4, up the bloody Tigers.
One of the best games of the season
Games like this are what make the Championship great. Wow, what an 8 goal thriller.
Ooh, that’s gonna leave a mark
i''ve missed a cracker lads
Going away from goal and a defender is covering....Ekwah dafuck.
Can’t believe it. What a game
Insane game
Nope
I managed to miss every single goal in this game.
The silver lining as I watch Forest slide towards the relegation zone is that I know the Championship is pound for pound the most entertaining league in world football
I am friends with somebody whose favorite club is a Championship/Ligue 1 yoyo club and has been for years.  I asked him if he hoped one day they'd get promoted to the Premier League and he just said "no, absolutely not I'd rather they go down to League 2"
TBH wouldn't mind our playoff chances being over, we're not going up so if there's no chance we can stop playing the loan players and start developing players like Ba, Lihadji and Bennette who have been on the fringes
Finally Amad looking like the £30m youngster we knew he could be. Thank you to Tony and Sunderland, has been a fantastic loan
Nope
Just basically had to stand there and block the shot. No idea what he was thinking.
I believe it was 5 added minutes, but the penalty was given at 95' and it took about 3 minutes to take after all the commotion.
Dominated is a strange way of looking at it.
Aye, this is the first season in ages where the PL is more entertaining than the Championship. Mostly because Burnley and Sheffield United have had top 2 on lock for ages now. QPR's collaspe has been entertaining though.
Being everyone’s cup final is no fun tbf
Neither is watching you be picked for the TV game every fucking week
I miss sustained periods of Saturday 3pms so much. Unless it's on a Tuesday night, 7:45 kickoffs are absolute dogshit
Awful for us too, especially if you travel over for matches. Absolute nightmare trying to plan in advance when Sky are changing the fixtures left and right.
I was wondering who they’d show on TV constantly after us and Villa went up. They don’t really have a cash cow anymore do they?
What’s wrong with the Tuesday games, quite good to go to a match after work
it's a lot more balanced this season tbf, Sheff Utd and Boro, Norwich when they're good and Sunderland are probably the faves
Tuesdays are the only good ones - Monday and Friday evening games are absolute shite, as are the later games at the weekend
Monday night is so grim. Always think of this bloody Sunderland game where I had the worst day at work, it pissed down all night, then Defoe scored in the 80 something minute at Selhurst. Got home so wet and miserable.

Napoli has plot armor
Anulo-ing works
The cock and the falcon
the rumors of napoli's demise were greatly exaggerated
Cool cool cool
Farcical play from both Gallo and Falcone
ugliest goal ive seen in my whole life
WTH was that
Really poor play by the defence and gk
Napoli is finished. They have no more steam, they are physically done. There is no way this team even come close to play against Milan. Easy 2wins and Semis for Milan.
When's the earliest Napoli can confirm it?
No x Milan
They get lucky and they don't even need to get lucky at this point lol
Don't think Gallo does much wrong tbh. That ball was easily catchable for the GK. He's the one who fucked up.
Is this an anulo mufa thing or you're serious?
After the Udinese game apparently (May 3rd)
Saving the plot armor against milan for the ucl games
Oh yeah luck.Simeone injured is luck.
I disagree, he shouldn't be playing it to his keeper from such a close distance, especially if he can't get it under control
Absolutely serious. Napoli has been gutted with double injury on the center forward (both Oshimen and Simeone are out) and the National Break has destroyed the team physically.  They got smaked by Milan 4-0 at home and they are walking on the pitch.  I’m going to bet 1k euros on milan passing the turn tomorrow.
I doubt he tried to pass it to the keeper. Seems like one of those instances where you don't think the ball will make it to you. You have guys jumping in front of you covering your view of the ball and none of them get a touch on it.
I wouldnt be so sure.Champions is a different thing from Serie a,plus Osimhen is supposed to play with milan.
Probably will not be able to or will be just turning back from a muscular injury.  As I said I’m going to bet a shit ton of money on milan tomorrow

Unbelievable, how Porto always has their number and Benfica always spreads their legs
Porto could be relegated and we would still lose against them
We could dress up Real Madrid in Benfica kit and they’d lose to Porto.
Got to maintain tradition
I feel like I got a premonition, Taremi will be joining Roma next season
Not sure how but nice
How are we playing so shit all of a sudden
Beautiful goal. Well deserved too.
Éder inspired goal
Boo, you’re no fun Benfas
great
Vlachodimos. 3 shots on target. 3 goals. Get him off my club immediately
Vlachoshit at it again
Porto plays with max morale against Benfica
Or Mirandela in Porto kit and you'd lose
I honestly want to see him there or at Chelsea
Agreed
Yeah
Defense suck at their job, all great shots and still manage to try to blame the less guilty player. Sure
Noddysseas does it again.
He isn’t world class, never has been. He wasn’t the one to blame today, our defense was dreadful
Thought entire league did
Unfortunately, given today’s performance, this seems to make much more sense.
Who lied to you like that?
The entire league are pussies and play like rabbits in a trap against all the big teams, apart from a few inspired ones every now and then.
Lmao absolutely not
Porto's ideology is so be against the Lisbon teams, especially Benfica.
Nobody lied; It's well known that most clubs were paid extra to win vs the big portuguese clubs.
Portuguese league summed up
not only in football. sometimes I compare ourselves to the Catalonia vs Spain feud
Against benfica? Hardly.
I think the most comparable rivalry is Ajax vs Feyenoord, Rotterdam never wished to be independent from the main government just like Porto never did.
On a smaller dimension, it is comparable.
So Marítimo is Barcelona?
I mean, I guess lmao. with the exception they’re *slightly* less successful than Barça in Europe.

Comeback incoming  Children named after Rabiot  Allegri dissolves Juve board, proclaims empire
This is ze history of ze Napoli
Please don' bottle this league Napoli... There is no way, right?
He celebrated with the frontward sewy lmao.
Deserved, Lecce have been playing well.
Well this is not ideal
Napoli have peaked too early in the season and now look gassed.  For scudetto it seems over unless only CONI (italian BDO) give Juventus their 15 points back tho
What a turn
*No.. don’t give me hope*
Based Lecce 🫡
Napoli please dont do this.
Uh oh, it's happening!*  *waiting a little bit longer
*Te n'intendi d' ippiha?*
Massimiliano does have a royal quality tbf
We are victims of the mufa
Nah, there’s absolutely no way the can bottle this too… right?
It looks really not unlikely they will give 15 back.
How much anulo is needed? I am willing to commit half of it
I think it's super unlikely, they're not judging the accusation itself but the procedure
Double it and give it to the next person
Yes but if the procedure is faulty, the judgement gets overturn. I think the next punishment will be next season likely
I don't think the procedure was faulty from what I've seen, but we'll see!

I'm not sure why I'm watching this game but I have 0 regret. So many misplays and good plays.
Properly watching Amad play today, he definitely has got to be in the squad next season. From the second I saw him I knew the talent was there. To see him now putting in performance after performance is great. Now let’s see if he can do it in the prem. The right side is there for the taking if he wants it
Absolutely mental match, end to end stuff
Orgasmic football on display.  I've watched a handful of mental games this season and Sunderland participated in at least two of them.
AMAD
Lighting fast counter
Insane game
Similar to the goal against was it Rotherham at the start of the season? Great teamwork.
Same
He's still a bit inconsistent but when he's on it he's unplayable in the Championship.
Should definitely loan him back to you again your manager has handled him brilliantly
That’s expected from a young player though so I don’t mind it. Especially from one who is having his proper first season of first team football
We'd fucking love that like but think it's v unlikely. Would imagine hell be in and around your first team next season.
If Sunderland get promoted hes probably getting loaned back
We're not getting promoted mate
Damn its been a while since I looked at the table my bad

Soft pen but it's nice to benefit for once.
He trips over his own feet?
Dive
Soft pen, but Hull have got away with a few calls that could have been soft pens, shouldn't really be doing that in the box.
Feel like this is usually a foul outside of the box, but a very soft pen

The one thing I can say my dick is bigger than was that offside margin
I would be pissed if this was the other way around.
BT Sport commentator, upon seeing the first replay, said that "the arm of Silva was playing him onside." Good to see we're paying for pundits of the highest quality who are fully aware of the basic rules of football
Game's gone
6cm offside
Thats 4cm more offside than Darwin’s last year
[i've interpreted this as 6cm inside honestly](https://imgur.com/a/PK1Oiju)
😂😂😂😂
damn
Bullshit
how can VAR judge a "6 cm" offside ?   What a joke
Offside rule change when
It is what it is, I think the rules are bullshit too. But we also had goals disallowed in the same way.
6cm, Jesus
The robbery omg, the players are aligned. If there are a few cms between them, it's the Benfica player that looks slightly in front.
Must be nice having a 6,5cm dick
Must be nice
I mean, we had a goal disallowed for 2cms against Porto just last season.  Also in the 18\19 Allianz Cup, the Rafa play, don't remember how many cms, but same shit.
This man from GolTV asked if his fingernails were too long
Technically not wrong, the top of the arm, from the shoulder to where a short sleeve ends, is still considered fair game and counts for the offside
Still less than aboubakar offside call a few years ago, that's the best offside call I've seen up to this day
Yeah me too, red for Benfica and blue for Porto. I was so confused
It's coping brother
as long as its more than 0cm its offside, 1 over is still over.
Last year Darwin had a goal disallowed for a 2cm offside, so it's still 4cm bigger
Because there are cameras and systems to draw these lines perfectly?   If anything it's one of the few VAR scenarios that really isn't up to debate
now even the VAR tech is against Porto...
It’s actually 7 but I get what you say
6.001cm dick
I was pissed in those occasions as well!   At least, in this instance, it’s been consistent.
-2m offside? Yep, still offside
Its fine
ok so the final decision only made on "when the guy in the VAR car press on the pause button" cause in this case if you just look the frame (1 micro second sooner) the guy can be onside   &#x200B;  that's why 6cm offiside is pointless
One frame before the one that they choose and it's not offside. It is what it is, but we can never know for sure if he really is offside or not.
Perfectly? Surely you must be joking.
Can't argue with that logic, fair point.
thanks mate
Pretty sure they choose the latest frame before the ball leaves the foot, which is the correct way to judge it.   One frame before and it's not really the accurate way to judge for an offside.
What's not perfect about it?   In a stadium with multiple cameras that allow for a perfect view of the play, this is literally done via computer where there's no margin of error...
Hello banter era my old friend
If Roma and Atalanta win their games Inter will be in 6th place. That would mean 7th if Juve hadn't gotten the -15...
Inter's finally gonna have to play primavera players next season since they won't have any senior players. Well primavera+Gagliardini.  Come back Mr. Thohir..
So Bastoni will be leaving on a free then...
Lmao
Didnt Hakan imply that he has left Milan for a club with ambition   what happened Hakan??
And to think they might get overtaken by Roma of all teams. Mourinho giveth and Mourinho taketh.
So much for winning trophies, Hakan.   Fucking snake
They have lost 10 league games already.
Inters primavera players have been put on loan so long some are approaching their mid twenties.
His contract ends in 2024
What happened? Inter we’re more ambitious at the time but their owner is in deep trouble.  I know it’s popular to shot on Calhanoglu but there was no way for him to know this would happen.
When he said ambition he meant an extra 500k a year.
Yes, I meant next year.
After winning the league Inter had already lost Conte, Hakimi, and Lukaku had one foot out the door by the time Hakan arrived. How was there no way for him to know what would happen? The Inter management has been 'broke' for a few years too, the writing was literally on the wall
The only kind of ambition that matters! Get that bag!
1,5. It was 500k for the first year but it rose to 1,5m after that
He might have agreed the deal verbally with Inter before all of that became evident.  It's not like Milan's financial and sporting situation was looking great at the time either
He only signed for Inter like a month after Eriksen collapsed and it became evident he couldn’t play for Inter again. By then all of the things I mentioned had already happened. He had no agreement with anyone before that   Our financial situation has been great ever since elliott took over. We’ve literally had no problems whatsoever
Signed officially, that's why I said agreed verbally. They could very well have been talking for some 6 months prior to that and agreed verbally at some point, without him knowing how the full picture would look at the time he did sign.       And do correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't Elliott take over Milan like a year afterwards?
That didn’t happen as Inter were counting on Eriksen. Eriksen had just started playing well (that season) and became an integral player for their system so there was literally no reason for them to go after anyone. Hakan was negotiating with us well into the season until inter came in after the eriksen incident and offered more. Ibra, who at the time was very close to Hakan, said himself in his own book that Hakan would’ve never joined Inter without the eriksen incident   And no, Elliott took us over back in 2018. Redbird bought us from elliott last year, though

Pepê’s touch, beauty
That was just well hit. Perfect goal. That’s what’s frustrating about it.
This is the weirdest thing. Like 30 minutes ago I switched channels from the Napoli game, Benfica scored within 10 seconds. Now I switched channels again and Porto scored immediately
What a sexy assist
Name: Uribe  Job: Play well in Benficas stadium even in his bad seasons.
What a goal, let's goo
Golaço fds
Great hit
Mateus continuing the Colombian legacy at Porto
Deserved. One of the worst Benfica matches this season, IMO.
Perfume
keep switching
Last weeks game was far worse lol
You haven’t seen many Benfica matches this season then.
Well shit
I mostly see big matches (CL, big four), and I don't remember a worse match. They've been outplayed since the start.
So vejo na champions, vi o rio ave no outro dia e agora o do porto. Baixaram o nivel após a paragem das seleções? Não jogam um crl e tinham o caminho feito para a final da champions. Na se metam a jeito fdps, quero ver uma equipa portuguesa na final
> They've been outplayed since the start.  More likely the strategy is to hold back and let Porto have the ball, because they'll be applying a high pressure anyway and we can be quite clinical on the counter (and TBH are better defensively).  Not working as well as they planned (not the first time the season, we haven't been particularly successful any time we try to speculate the game), but despite having more % possession, Porto isn't creating much. "Outplayed" is a bit of an exaggeration.
Sempre que pára para as seleções, baixamos 20 niveis, não é por acaso que a maior parte das nossas perdas de pontos foram depois delas
For some added context, Farrelly originally retired in 2016 after a car accident. What we didn't know at the time was that for years Farrelly had been sexually abused by coach Paul Riley, with that information coming out recently after reporting in the Athletic and later an independent report commissioned by US Soccer as well as an NWSL/NWSLPA joint investigation. This year she got invited to the NY/NJ Gotham's preseason and earned a contract, and she just made her first NWSL appearance since 2015. And now obviously has earned an invite to represent Ireland.
Big Irish head on her. Fit right in.
Also she reportedly rejected a roster spot to be on the USWNT’s Squad for the 2011 FIFA Women’s World Cup due to comments that Riley made to her saying that she shouldn’t be on the national team  unless he was the coach of the USWNT
She’d have been fooling no one playing for anyone else.
Didn't stop Rooney. There's the head of a junior b hatchet man from Offaly.
Fair point. Proper ceann on him!

Kim did a Di Lorenzo for Di Lorenzo here
Bullet header
That was a long fucking check for a relatively easy decision
Why did the judge put the ball in special bag flagged as collectible?
Wtf took so long?
Did you see the images the offside produced? it was extremely close.
being auctioned apparently
Ball is going on auction for charity I guess

How can you keep a goal against the sun himself
Benfica fans : Caralho  Porto fans : Caralho
Bela merda
Absolutely tragic  Ramos deserves an assist in his stats
VAMOOOOOOOOS!!!
WHAT A START. VAMOSS CARALHOOOO
Nice run from Bah and great assist from Gonçalo Ramos
How’s this considered own goal o.o
Letssss goooo
Diogo Costa also wants to be champion
Pqp
Couldnt start better
Gonçalos price increased from 120 to 150 million   Beautiful assist as well
Sempre a meter frangos este diogo costa nao sabe defender a higita wtf
He has
I suspect it has something to do with the fact that the ball was moving away from the goal line before hitting Diogo's back. But don't quote me on that.
Pretty sure that if the ball isn't going in from the initial strike, it's considered an own goal.
He needs to become a starter for Portugal first
Sejam amigos! Deixem a porrada pro pessoal em campo.
The mental block we have against porto is absolutely infuriating. Can't string two passes together and give the ball away everytime we recover it. Just end this game already please and thank you
Pepe has no right to be that good at 40 y/o
Otavio is always such a cunt?
GOLTV English commentator is awesome, lmao. Sounds so lonely and drunk at the same time!
Benfica play with barely any intensity or urgency. You'd think they are leading.
We need to be smarter when we are in possession. Too many easy give away when we have the ball.
Parabéns ao Porto, fez mais por isso.
Unbelievable.. we missed a free 1-3 right now
Benfica is the type of club that even if it had the team to obliterate the competition in the Champions League it would mentally lose a game against a struggling Porto side every day of the week.
We fully deserve this loss. What a horrible performance.
Miserable game from Rafa.   Totally absent the entire game.
Porto deserved the win, we've been having a good season but this was a shit game, players bumping into each other in midfield and close to no intensity at all, we better step up or Inter is gonna steamroll us.
Fucking Inter, I wanted to watch this in CL
Taremi.exe stopped working there
How did Ramos miss that header?!
Lesss goo
O Otavio nao leva cartao????
Came here expecting some spice but mods have already gone soft smh
Benfica hesitating a few times in front of goal
good goal
Sub off chiquino for Neres.   Place Aursnes into midfield.
Joke, you can never get scored on in that position...
Taremi what the fuck?!?!
Taremi with a Paulinho moment
Can’t remember the last time I watch a Portuguese league game but I’m watching it 👍🏼
Artur "I pretend I do not see it" Soares Dias
Otavio getting a yellow lmao
VAMOS CARALHO
With this ref we knew it was gonna be a disaster
Thank god J. Félix left. That kid made benfica play against Porto with a vengeance. After that it was right back to usual
we deserve to be in the lead, unlucky offside.
So if Benfica win this the league is over? Or league is already over anyway?
Game could've been done already
Great game and two very quick and good goals by Porto
what the fuck was that
A malta do contumil já está a falar de roubos..
Ramoooooos
Bro how does ramos have so mant goals lmao
Goal before match thread
Pode ser a azia que está a fluir no meu sistema, mas julgo que o Soares Dias não tem estaleca para manter os clássicos Benfica vs Porto controlados. Para ambos os lados.  Nota: O Benfica está a perder justamente, estão a jogar de uma forma passiva que até podia ser o Rui Costa a arbitrar e estaria a perder.
Yellow card for Otavio omg. A miracle.
Smart game by Benfica. Porto is the one that needs to win and will push forward, we're all but comfortable waiting for a counter, considering we have been pretty clinical this season.
God inter are going to get toasted
pricks, no intensity, no personality, but we needed this reality check, J. Mário, Florentino and Chiquinho arent good enough for big matches and António Silva have fallen off a clif since the world cup
VAR. Obrigado ☝️
What happened to Veron? Not even on the bench.
It’s been happening for decades. The best and worst Benfica teams always cower against Porto. There’s a university psychology study waiting to be done on this I swear.
He is Cuntmaster Flex
Always and will always be, he doesn't get punished either
Got a link? Trying to watch in Spain
Welcome to Benfica vs Porto games of the last 30 years
Roger gave them a vacation and now they play like shit, exactly like last time.
Isso só nas competições internacionais
Chiquinho is having a better game than Aursnes IMO
Holy Friday alright
Joao felix already has like 10 games against porto and he only did something on that game lol , i was more afraid of Lima to be honest
If we loose, there is a some room for Porto to recover 7pts (we have a harder schedule, will play vs Braga at home and Sporting away, and they may capitalize on their momentum).   A win or draw leaves us with a 10pts ahead with 7 games left (and head-to-head advantage, so 11pts in reality), while not certain it's unlikely we don't win the league.
Winning pretty much seals it imo. Losing it, Benfica can still lose their game Vs Braga and the game Vs Sporting and still be 1 point ahead
If we draw I think it's pretty much over.   If we lose then all it takes is a loss to Braga and Sporting (which are both a very realistic result) and it's only a 1 point lead.   Of course this assumes Porto never slips up and wins every game.
13 points ahead with 18 points to go.
I think it's over anyway
League is shit
Nop. I requested it several minutes ago.
Anulo Mufa
This is your fault + anulo mufa
people need some emotional control, yesterday "best team in the world", today this, relax dude
i love to shit on Porto too but thats not a clear red
Injuries I think
I think benfica prepares these matches differently but in a more tactical approach porto does this but they play their guts and hearts out I don’t have problem admitting that porto and it’s hatred for Lisbon and benfica which we see it as system and the rival to beat made us grow in the big team we are nowadays … if you prepare the match well in terms of studying the opponent his strengths and weaknesses and you are superior in strategy and you joined that with that heaven shaking motivation you win all matches , problem for porto players is that understandably they don’t bring some of this passion against weaker opposition in the league
check dm
Both have made some pretty shitty mistakes
Terribly underrated player. It's one of those players that busts his ass off for the team.. wish we could have had more years of him.
*21pts in play after this game. A win by Benfica leaves them 3 wins (or 2 wins + draw) left to win the league.
No even in champions he has them. Just been my least favorite striker at benfica. But glad he scored them for us
Ahh makes sense. Thanks
You are right.
Over hyped average striker, couldn't give two fucks about him, bring me back some one good like Cardozo or Jonas
Agreed. But we hell sell high and hopefully get us someone better
