Never too late to start! I joined as a complete newb at 25yr. There's lots of low bottom level beer leagues out there. Totally recommend hitting up a stick and puck just to get a taste of you're interested or not.
Ok
To be honest, I find soccer skills way more impressive.   The speed is different, to be sure, but humans are generally made to manipulate things with our hands.   Having to do it with everything but your hands is was more difficult for me.   I mean, sure, either of them at any even mildly advanced level is way above my pay grade.
Canlan ice sports has a beginners league that also teaches you. I think it’s a practice the first 30 minutes, then a game the next 30. They’d play before us and a few guys even got picked up by a few teams that saw them play. I’ve watched guys who couldn’t skate before, getting breakaways and scoring. It’s never too late, and if you’re already athletic, hockey should be an easy pick up. Skating and such. The rules however will fuck with you
I think soccer is one of the easier sports tbh. Like there are a bunch of freestylers who train a few years and have better skills on the ball than any professional soccer players. I got decent fast feet with soccer and i feel like if i put in the same amount of time I put into hockey like I did in soccer I’d feel like I’d be WAY worse.
Yeah!!! Canadian women taking names and kicking a**!!!
Sucks how it ended for him. Now he’ll have to take a league min maybe on a one year show me deal because he looked so awful in the past 3 games.
His ego’s too big for the stage he’s at in his career. Had the same problem in Minnesota.
I can understand wanting some stability after how things played out in Minnesota but part of getting traded was how he handled early offseason last year, and now he's played himself out of a position which proves he's worth more to the Sens org than a single year.
Ya think boo-boo? Great analysis.
That’s some inside info right there.
At age 35 and with the year he’s had, Talbot is probably going to have two choices: Start on a shitty team for average money, or back-up a good team on a cheap, one-year deal.  Assuming Halak is gone after this season, I wouldn’t mind him coming back to the Rangers.
Toronto's next copium goalie
Turning into a Rask for Raycroft situation
https://moneypuck.com/goalies.htm  I could see why talbot hasnt been happy.   He has come exactly as advertised. A goalie that can give you 30-50 games a year that hovers around the breakeven point in the GSAE catagory.  He did that but Ottawa was SO terrible in front of him that meant league average goalie play resulted in a .900 sv percentage. Yet hes the one getting dunked on and not the absolute dumpsterfire playing in front of him
He'll get more than league min. Martin Jones got $2 mil and it doesn't matter how bad he does, he's gonna make another $2 mil.
I can definitely see Stevie Y taking a flyer
Had kinda the same thing in Edmonton I remember him making a weird comment about how he not apart of the leadership group anymore before he left
It’s called my quote
Age difference matters. How many players vastly improve after their age 35 season. Jones turned 33 a couple months ago. I'd say he gets low 1M at most.
Isn’t Craig Anderson still improving? I figure by the time he hits 50 he’ll basically be prime Hasek.
Fleury still got 3.5 million for multiple years at 37 years old.   Talbot is 18th in starts over the last 3 seasons he will easily get 2 million from a team looking for a tandem guy.  Martin jones age is easily offset by the FOURTEEN point save percentage difference between talbot and jones.
Unlike most human males Craig Anderson has massive balls of steel so he ages differently. He's for sure a vezina candidate in the next few years.
Boston has done 4   77,78,79 they lost to the habs, and in 80 they lost to the islanders  the Blues did 3 in a row in their first 3 years in the league
Not exactly answering your question, but I think whoever plays the leafs in the first round is cursed to lose in the finals  The leafs lost to the Bruins in 2019 who lost in the finals, the Habs in 2021 who lost in the finals and the Lightning in 2022 who lost in the finals.
Columbus had 3 in 4 years:  Penguins in 2017  Caps in 2018  Lightning in 2020
Columbus lost to the pens in 2016, lost to the pens in 2017, lost to the caps in 2018, lost to Boston in 2019, and then lost to Tampa in 2020  4/5 of those teams won the cup in those years, and the one that didn’t went to game 7 of the SCF  Edit: correction, blue jackets didn’t make the playoffs in 2016. So 3/4 teams won the cup after beating them and the one that didn’t went to game 7 of the ECF
Any team that lost to the Edmonton Oilers in the 1980's.
These were the dark years my father told me about
Looks like the Corey Perry curse will continue!!!
to add to this, i’ve noticed that when long time leafs leave the team - they win the cup or go a deep run    -	kessel: won 2 cups  -	bozak: won cup  -	phaneuf: went to conference finals  -	kadri: won cup  guess this team really is cursed 😂
በጣም ተረግመናል ተቃዋሚዎቻችንን በማህበር እንረግማለን።
2017, 18, and 2020 throw a wrench in that timeline though.   Caps and bruins lost in round 2 while the jackets got beaten by the lightning in the wacky 2020 playoffs
The 2019 Bruins were one game away from making it four in a row, too.
My father described them quite differently
don’t forget Hyman!
Everyone but JVR basically has had deep playoff success of notables who left the Leafs
Get that Calgary shit outta here
https://m.imgur.com/9I7jdxu
The jackets didn't beat the leafs in round 1.  The last three times the leafs made the playoffs however, their opponent lost in the cup finals.
Funny that the one missing year in the streak was the year they faced the best team out of all of them.
Y’all got swept, not sure it counts if you don’t win a game
I must’ve forgot when Hyman won a cup
Arizona hasn’t seen this many hits since the Gin Blossoms
Now he has only one thing left to do. Get Mendoza.
I wish he signed with the wild
I love that it's a guy named McBain that did it. Feels like a Simpsons joke
MCBAIN!  *Ice to see you*
Jack McBang
I still need to get me a McBain jersey, I love that guy
Jack McPain
Jimmy Eat World’s from Arizona too
Bruh that nostalgia hit me hard
MENDOZAAAAA!!!
I don’t, he’s just a shit stirrer we have enough of those
But Gin Blossoms are good
Would have lost money. Honestly thought they were from Jersey. Must be thinking Fountains of Wayne
I’d say 15 year old me would fight you for that, but 15 year old me was a Jimmy Eat World fan… so he wasn’t much of a fighter
Boooo JEW rule
15 year old me was deep into Linkin Park and Coheed and Cambria. We'd both get our asses kicked
Let the record show u/Zero_Originality is anti-JEW
All three of these things come up on my playlists from time to time and they're all welcome.
Even Gritty's phoning it in.
Why would they? There's probably two guys on the roster who will still be on the team in 2 years.
Yeah…we’ve known that for a good while.😔
Yeah. That’ll happen when you trade away the heart of your team. Kinda hard to regroup and move on in the post-Giroux era for the Flyers.   It certainly doesn’t help that a lot of their draft picks in the past 15 or so years haven’t panned out as hoped.   I wouldn’t be shocked if there were quite a few moves within the off-season or during the draft to try and get some capital.
Fucking kill me
Newsflash: most guys out here don't care, either.  Start running the franchise with some savvy & and intelligence, and maybe we will again.
Time to move the franchise
If I was the GM of another NHL franchise, the entire Flyers team would be DNS. Understand it's been an insanely negative year, but there's a time where being a fucking professional is noticed. I think about guys like Hampus Lindholm. That guy was on a bottom feeder, and still came to play every night. Being put into a contending situation, he thrives. There is a big difference between having a losing mentality, and having a winning mentality.
Tough to play for a hard ass when your team just isn’t good enough
Why is the Flyers’ assistant coach getting an inside look into the Jets’ locker room? /s
Maybe it’s upper management that doesn’t care and the players just don’t have the talent. Being the worse team on paper for multiple years in a row and not being put in a position to succeed will impact your give a shit meter
Cause they’re playing for millions of dollars lol
You guys should have signed Jim Montgomery 1st.   Which players would you keep?
Trading G could have made some sense if things were different, but they weren’t, so it didn’t.
Giroux is having his second best season based on number of goals this year. G will always be a flyer but OTT really does love him. His “coming home” was the biggest news prior to this season for us. He’s honestly a gem. What was the reason for the trade to Florida?
Boom. Roasted.
To be fair the ducks were really good for 75% of his time there
When you know that you're going to lose in embarrassing fashion no matter how much effort you're putting in, it's awfully hard to get up and energized for 82 games a year.  Like am I really going to jump in front of a 100 mile an hour slap shot when my team was eliminated from playoff contention mid-November and knowing I'm going to be traded this summer as the team continues to get stripped down? I don't think so.
Your effort and play will dictate future contracts and can influence where you’re traded to on top of it. No contender will want you if you’re a lazy-mail-it-in player. You can also still develop your own skills and bet on yourself longterm which again can dictate future contracts.    And then there’s the whole argument of let’s stop pretending to have any fucking clue the mindset, lifestyle, or situations professional athletes are in when we’re just a bunch of redditors lol.
They lose because so few of them give a damn... this roster is better than the record. They just dont play with any balls.
Do players still want to win even if the GM wants to tank? Absolutely. Look at Montréal, Arizona, or Erik Karlsson.  Nevertheless, there's a difference between wanting to win on a contender and wanting to win on a bottom-feeder. There's a limit to how much punishment you're willing to take for perhaps a better next contract. Each player has their own limit, but they all have it.
Found Chuck Fletcher
I get that strategies would be different if they moved to the point structure, but I find it funny how little it ever changes anything if you move to it in any analysis like this.
It'd be nice if the Jets 2.0 could be a team for more than a 2 game stretch rn.   *sigh*
* Czechs hung around for a while but just ran out of gas. Especially on the blueline - boxscore has Lásková at 29:40 TOI, and Pejšová at 28:06. On the second game of back to back after going to OT yesterday. They have the top end that can hang with anyone but at the moment they just aren't deep enough. Still plenty of positives. I know I'm biased gushing about her but Mlýnková was *everywhere*.   * MPP good, upvotes to the left. Not only with the two goals but damn near flawless in the faceoff circle too. Turnbull dropping a rather quiet four points too.
Congrats on 100 Poulin!
Pou's second was unbelievable. Such poise and patience for the lane to open for her.
Maybe try local buy and sell groups? Seem to be sold out on both official and resale websites unfortunately
[Here you go](https://lmgtfy.app/?q=Women%E2%80%99s+World+Championship+Tickets)
They’re sold out on every link provided by google 🤷‍♀️
The comments were correct that the Bruins prediction was about 20 points off from where they actually finish.
In his first preseason predictions he didn’t understand why his model had the bruins so high so he went back and reworked it… and it had the bruins finishing even higher lol.
He nailed it on the Bruins. but I don’t think I’ve seen a worse prediction for the pacific all year
Not great, Bob!   Although he did nail the Bruins winning the Atlantic.
You lose 100% of the games you don't win
Damn, Pacific was waaaaaaaaaaaaay off
Caps…yikes  Devils too
Flames and Canucks top 2 in the Pacific with the Kings and Kraken missing. Can we go to this timeline instead?  Interesting they predicted the Boston domination though, even though they obviously understated it
His Central is pretty spot on other than Dallas
Could go 75% of playoff teams from preseason, that's pretty good.
So many comments questioning that Bruins prediction, which seems reasonable enough; it was a wild prediction. So many cocky comments from Bruins fans who waited 1-3 months before defending their team. Which… idk, I get wanting to dunk on people who were wrong, but you weren’t confident enough to defend them initially. Getting cocky after the fact seems kind of weak.
The Vancouver Canucks prediction is pretty interesting. They seemed to have played well through the end of the season when Boudreau initially came in. However, they lost two assistant coaches and then Demko got injured. Myers played even worse too.   I wonder if there's an alternate reality where the Vancouver Canucks are threatening the WC2. Instead we have this timeline where Tocchet goes on about body language and being a man.   I also didn't expect the Bruins to do so well. I had them 2nd or 3rd in the Atlantic. But it makes sense we have our battle of fate matchup again with Leafs vs Lightning.
Crazy how wrong he was
The Pacific is like a Canadians wet dream.
shit predictions
Honestly, it's pretty accurate.   Only egregious ones I can see are Vancouver, Washington, and NJ.   The other outliers (CGY, SEA, NYI, CAR, FLA) are all pretty reasonable ones, the overperformers are basically all teams very badly not clicking, and the underperformers aren't by that much.
Damn, he wasn't super far off on Detroit or Ottawa, but he was wayyyyyyy too low on Buffalo
At least he got Columbus sort of right
shamelessly piggybacking on this comment  It's easy to look at this stuff in retrospect and say "damn that's crazy wrong" but when it comes to stuff like this, everyone is crazy wrong. it is insanely hard to predict standings points in the preseason  The average "points off" that my model was per team is about 10.6. that's below-average, certainly worse than usual and a sign that some changes will have to be made.  but to put that in perspective, the Vegas odds were one standing point closer per team (9.6). The best model is on average 9.2 points off per team. the average of the 400+ fan surveys I collected was 10.3 off, the best was 8.7.  (The point of this isn't to absolve my model, which I'm not happy with, but to shine some light on just how hopeless the whole endeavor is and how easy it is to laugh at anyone who tries)
At least he had your team making the playoffs!
*Presidents Trophy
He still probably had the Devils at a higher point toal than most, he just overestimated the rest of the Metro
First is a bit much but I can see why we were considered one of the top teams (especially by a computer)  Added Brown and Strome to the top six, dramatically improved our goaltending by swapping out sammy and VV for kuemper and chucky sideburns (definitely more of an upgrade on the starter side, point still stands). McMichael had great metrics last season, and Eller had declining offense but still had good defense last season  Computer can’t account for literally everything going wrong and having half of the roster regress
Nah I like the current timeline thanks
My guess is that Wyatt Johnston becoming a quality middle 6 forward in his rookie year contributed greatly towards the Stars overperforming his prediction
Is it really good though? I feel like a moderately informed hockey fan could have predicted as good if not better.
That timeline exists with a healthy Demko.
I wouldn’t really call them shit. Correct on a lot, placement was the main issue though. Was correct on Boston winning the president’s trophy though.
Let's see yours
I'm a bit bias as a Stars fan, I'll admit, but having Dallas not in the playoffs at all feels like a pretty big miss too.
Oh hey, it’s you lol. Fwiw I wasn’t criticizing you in my initial comment, big fan of your stuff, I just thought it was an objectively funny moment.
Does that mean that your model is no better than the average randos guess if the average deviation is about the same?  Not being snarky, I have no ideas how statistics work. I probably shoulda taken those electives lol.
Yeah… not sure how you miss on Vegas with all the injuries y’all had last year. Vancouver also never looked good, so that one is completely laughable
Devils fans said last year league average goaltending would get them into the playoffs.  Yes Hughes and Hischier exceeded their high expectations but no one counted on a resurgent Tatar, Mercer making a huge leap, or especially the D corps turning into an analytics darling for 3 months.
I'm a Vancouver fan, but I'm still pretty stoked to see Seattle in the playoffs for the first time. I know everyone wants the Kraken and the Canucks to be rivals, but I'm just happy for you folks.
You barely made it last year and are predicted to barely miss. Seems reasonable. Remember that it's based on a model which likely isn't taking account for Rick Bowness being going
nope just purely piggybacking on top comment. and yes i do find it funny that Boston was my 2nd most wrong team despite taking so much shit for having them in 1st lol
that means that this year, indeed the average rando did predict the standings better than the model did by a small margin. I'll take the L
To be completely fair, new coaching is hard to quantify, and a lot of people did think we were about to fall off of a cliff after last year.
If we had a healthy demko all year, I think we would have snuck in, but we had ahl goaltending 3/4 of the season.
Well earned, great player, proved it again last night
[Arh arh arh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQwYNca4iog)
Deserved
Can’t wait to see him centering Rasmussen and Perron. Our top 6 is gonna be dirty just like the Chariot signing
The award is just a gold plated Binford 5000
Forgets McDavid exists with the oilers.
We’re picking 2/3?
i’ll definitely have some of what they’re smoking
You said he is guaranteed many cups. McDavid is the best in the world and has a big donut in that column. Everything should be about McDick though he is well you know I’ve already said it
This list should have included Kyle Connor :(
It's so fucking funny to be the #1 player in all of NCAA, and you're still not the #1 prospect for your age group. #2 but like holy fuck bedards a lizardhuman
Are we surprised though? Kid’s a stud
Connor was snubbed. Vesey is a punk. I’m definitely not biased idk why that would come up 😂  Seriously good for him tho
That’s nuts that he put up 50 or 60 points in 35 games as a freshman and is still most likely gonna go second overall. I think it would be funny if he goes 1 because you can make somewhat of an argument but Bedard is insane, gonna be interesting how the draft lottery goes
Pretty good company.
Not a shock. Wasnt even a competition. Kid was so far ahead of everyone else it isnt even close.
I'm totally fine getting Fantilli. (Please)
Adam Fantilli is having an unbelievable season and he doesn't get talked about enough. People are too focused on Connor Bedard. Don't get me wrong, Bedard is guaranteed to win many cups for whichever team drafts him, but I feel we should also give Fantilli more appreciation.
misleading thumbnail lmao
Still makes no sense how they gave it to Vesey over him
That was absurd
Completely agree
Didn’t Connor score like 70 points while Vesey only had 45 when he was 3 years older?
If I had a nickel for every time this happened in the last 10 years. I'd have two nickels. Which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it happened twice.
Is it that surprising? You still have the entire CHL?
I mean, the top NCAA player is almost never the best prospect. The CHL is a way bigger and more successful pipeline to the NHL. KHL, SHL, and NCAA are all secondary as far as prospects go.
Would he even be #2 if it wasn't for Michkov's contract? Kind of brings into perspective how good the draft class is
It's actually crazy how similar the Bedard and Fantilli draft is to the McDavid and Eichel draft.
It’s like 2015 Draft lite
Potentially could be #3 too if not for Michkov's KHL contract/Russian factor
ur a stud
Fuck Vesey
You really can’t make any argument for Fantilli over Bedard
If someone drafted him over bedard that’s an instant firing and black listing from ever getting hired again
>I think it would be funny if he goes 1 because you can make somewhat of an argument  No, you cannot. If you think you can, then please do tell me the argument  On the contrary i think there is a good chance that Michkov will go second
What possible argument could you make to take Fantilli over Bedard?
Bedard has 143 in 57 games though and he also went in a tear durikng wjc.
It shouldn't have been a competition, but Hobey voters seem to prioritize those who return for more years.
Hutson should’ve got it. Broke a ton of records as a defenseman. But I’m super biased so there’s that
McDavid isn't guaranteed to win any cups for EDM. Bedard sure as shit doesn't come with any cup guarantees.
Even having Gretzky on your team didn’t guarantee a cup.   Bedard is one of the most hyped prospects since McDavid and he certainly could be that “face of the franchise” type of player. The only other person from this draft I could see holding a similar title is Michkov.   Fantilli probably goes #2 overall because of the concern over when Michkov would be allowed to come over, and that time is certainly unpredictable due to the ongoing invasion of Ukraine.
It's because college hockey gets so little coverage in the hockey prospects world compared to CHL.
Last year they gave the Hobey Baker award to a goalie, and then gave the award for Best Goalie to a different goalie. Whoever the people are who vote on these things are all nuts.
They like Popeyes over KFC
When/who was last?
And then Europe.
NCAA stands out because of the age group we're looking at.
CHL doesn't have 21-23 year olds playing and normally the ones dominating. Not that you're wrong but to be the best in the NCAA is way more difficult as a draft eligible player than chl imo
I don't think the CHL will ever be supplanted as the most popular route for prospects, but I'm actually surprised the NCAA route isn't more popular than it is currently.  You get to challenge yourself against older players, be king shit on a college campus for at least one year, and you have way more control over your NHL rights. If you *really* don't like the team that drafted you, you can stay in school and go straight to UFA.
Yes. Fantilli is above Michkov regardless of contract. Bigger. More two-way play. The more desirable position. Canadian bias.
Fantilli over Bedard if we’re going alphabetically by first name.
sure you can, just not a good one
Can't teach size. Checkmate atheists.
Fair looking at how the eichel McDavid draft has gone
Only one I can kinda see is if you see Bedard as a winger in the NHL.  Not saying I agree, but there has been some noise some GM's see him as an elite scoring winger in the NHL rather than a true #1 center due to his size and lack of high end speed
You could make a very weak argument based on Fantilli being more athletic and potentially having a game which will translate better.  I'm not saying it's a good argument but it exists.
I don't know anything about Fantilli beyond this thread. But Bedard is going to have to adapt his game for the NHL. He initiates contact and splits players all the time. When they're 6" taller and can skate, that major part of his toolkit might start to be a liability instead of an asset.  His shot and his shiftiness are still truly truly exceptional. But he doesn't play defense, skates well but it isn't a weapon like MacKinnon or McDavid. He has strategies he gets a lot of mileage out of that probably won't translate well.  I'm just saying there's risk. If anyone would benefit from a year at wing or in the AHL* it's him.   * I don't think he's eligible yet
> On the contrary i think there is a good chance that Michkov will go second  If it weren't for his KHL contract, yeah he would. I think he could fall as low as 4 or even 5 simply because the teams drafting that high won't want to wait 3+ years for him to come over.  edit: now, if a team does decide they'll wait *and* manages to get kiviharju next year, oh my
Never said it would be a good argument
Size. Guaranteed center. idk
Dang so he must've been a hobey finalist then?
Calm down
What
To be fair, I believe those two awards are voted on by different people, and the best goalie race was close
Fantilli didn’t win Big Ten player of the year this year.   Not only that, *he wasn’t even nominated.*   The powers that be in college hockey are just making it up as they go along.
They gave Caleb Williams the Heisman Trophy, but he wasn't good enough to win the Davey O'Brien last year.
But Popeyes is better than KFC
The aforementioned Jack Eichel.
At the time of his draft Eichel was probably a top 5 prospect since the year 2000.   But McDavid is McDavid
And then Asia.
Ahhhhhhh yes that's fair, how many NCAA players are actually that old tho? Looking at the points leaders they all seem under 21. It's still impressive for an 18 year old no doubt, especially considering there's a lot of hype around Matthew Knies for the Leafs, and Fantilli whos 2 years younger, blew him out of the water??? Like wtf.  https://www.ncaa.com/stats/icehockey-men/d1/current/individual/99  there are also some legendary names on this list: Swankler, Laffereniere at home.
The problem with NCAA is that if you want to play there you can't play Major Junior.   If I'm 16 I want to play OHL hockey, I'm not necessarily thinking about my future outside of hockey. Once I'm 18 and passed by the draft I can no longer commit to playing NCAA. So my options are limited to OHL over age, CIS hockey ( Canadian universities) where very few people make the show. Or maybe Europe ( can't go to the minor leagues until you age out of CHL)    If NCAA allowed CHL players I could see it becoming more popular
You can also get paid now with NIL. It’s not a huge thing in hockey yet, but could be a game changer.
BRB gonna go name my kid a blank space so they always at the top
Same noise that is now talking about how he has become a bit of a wrecking ball?  The kid is gonna measure 5’10” 190 at the combine, the size and speed worries are from 2 years ago
I honestly think Bedard ends up as the next Patrick Kane. Which is great. But he won’t be next McDavid is my guess. He doesn’t have the gamebreaking physical attributes.  If people think that’s crazy then they probably underrate Kane. Dude had 145 pts in 58 games vs Bedard has 143 in 57.
>due to his size and lack of high end speed  The size and speed argument is one that I could never make sense of. Watching Bedard play, you can see he obviously doesn't have McDavid speed, but he is still pretty damn fast. Just watching him at the world juniors the last 2 years, he'd smoothly and easily skate past most of the competition.  The size argument is also kind of dumb as the best player of the last 18ish years was the same height and only 8 lbs heavier than Bedard at the time of the 2005 draft.
I mean of the bottom teams, there are a few who can wait, Namely Arizona it would time with their new arena, but also Columbus if this year made them rethink their current group. Anaheim as well. San Jose is cursed with big contracts on their decent older players so they would probably be out. Chicago could do it They are still in tear down. Habs are probably filled with too many decent players to risk it and have some older guys they might want to try to win with now. Also we are talking about picks 2-4 here where you can still get excellent players. By 5 he is worth the wait for basically everyone.  Think of what Kaprizov did to Minny he would probably do something similar his rookie year.
> 3+ years  That's the real rub. Were I an NHL GM I'd be very concerned Russia will keep their young star well into the + range. Imagine being six years down the line and writing *another* letter (well, okay, it would be your replacement doing the writing) to some Russian undersecretary while Fantilli is getting Hart votes.
tf are you talking about? I'm not underrating Bedard, but a great individual player does not guarantee cups. McD hasn't won any and Bedards career will mostly run along McDs. Are you really going to guarantee many cups for Bedard regardless of the team that drafts him even when McDavid is in the league and NOT winning cups? Honestly do you even really follow hockey? That just isn't how it works.
Winning cups has nothing to do with having a generational talent. Obviously it helps, but this isn't the NBA. Getting a superstar guarantees your team nothing but lots of individual awards. Ask the oilers.
You absolutely aren’t. Gretzky’s 4 cups came from the Oilers dynasty that had other legendary players on it.   Having a player like Gretzky absolutely helps, but you need a team to support.   Look at his 8 years in LA. No cups with them. Still played with some of the best players to ever lace up the skates.   There is no guarantee in sports, even for someone as magical as Gretzky.  As for Bedard, we frankly don’t even know what is prime would even look like. Production in juniors is usually not a good indication of how well a skater will do in the big leagues.
Last year Devon Levi playing with Northeastern won the Mike Richter award for best NCAA goalie, but Dryden McKay, a goalie for Minnesota State, won the Hobey Baker for best player.
The Hobey Baker committee prioritizes players who spend several years in college hockey. Dryden McKay was in his last of four years in NCAA hockey, Devin Levi was in his first year.  McKay *did* have a great year, for what it's worth, but Devin Levi was .952 with 10 shutouts in 32 games.  Levi won the Mike Richter again this year. Also beat the Rangers 3-2 in his first game last week, which I thought was pretty funny.
Caleb was the only one that didn’t fall off a cliff in the last few weeks of the season. USC lost *despite* Caleb, not because of him.
It's unquestionably better.
It’s really weird but hear me out. Popeyes chicken and specifically their sandwiches are better in the US. But hands down KFC up and down the menu is better in Australia. The Zinger burger in Aus is god tier.
Which is why Connor lost
Popeyes sandwiches are better but KFC has better chicken.
Depends entirely on location. Menu alone isn't enough imo.
McDavid is also a lizardhuman.
Makes sense. Thanks
I love him
Let’s not forget Africa.
How many NCAA players are 21-23? An absolute fuck ton. Elite players aren’t sticking around because they’ve already gone pro but there are plenty of guys running out their eligibility.
Yeah I think the trend has been younger players are dominating more these days, of course I'm not home to look at historical data to confirm it. I do know the Hobey Baker tends to go to older players partially (and I have no idea how accurate this is, just what I read online so massive grain of salt) because the NCAA doesn't like giving it to players who play one year and just leave. If there's any truth to that, makes Fantilli even more impressive.
I didn't realize CHL players couldn't play in NCAA, are they considered "professionals" then?
It’s more that once you play a CHL game you’re ineligible, so you can fuck that path for yourself before you’re even out of high school.   I’m surprised more parents don’t push for Jr. A up here instead of Major Jr., at least for those that aren’t first round rated talent right out of the gate. So many guys have come through the BCHL-NCAA-NHL (or just straight to the show) that I’m surprised it’s not a larger thing in the rest of the country.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaron
It's not that his top speed is amazing but he has the acceleration and motor that makes it work at the NHL level. Fantilli probably wins if we're looking at top speed though
Columbus absolutely needs a 1C and in this draft if your them you grab a center
The Rangers losing is *always* funny.
International KFC puts American KFC to shame
KFC chicken tastes artificial. Like I can taste the steroids.
It’s insane that McDavid, Strome, DeBringcat and MacDermaid didn’t win the Otters the championship
Ahem, Australia, anyone?
Australia.
Yeah they receive a weekly stipend. The problem is it is not that much on average, I think there were some lawsuits saying it amounted to less than minimum wage when you take all a players efforts into consideration. They do often get living arrangements taken care of as well though. I also think they get a scholarship for every year of play, but that also means they have to make it into University.
Insubordinate, and churlish.
Dude.. Did you just put this guy who hasn't even been drafted yet on par with the greatest players of all time? That's fucking hilarious. No pressure kid!
Considering having Gretzky on your team did not guarantee you a cup, Bedard most certainly wouldn’t.
Gretzky was very much still in his prime with the Kings. Wasn’t the peak of his prime for sure, but he was still the best player in the league.   And besides, as I mentioned before, we have no clue what Bedard’s peak even is.
Canadian KFC sucks. Mary Browns and Popeye's are both better.
Why else go for fast fried chicken?
My grandparents lived in Erie so every time I’d visit them, I’d try to catch a game. Unfortunately I never managed to make one while McDavid was there and it’s a huge regret for me.   I do vividly remember one of their games having the most fights I’ve ever seen (live) in a game. Like 5 separate fights in one game.
It's hilarious that McDavid will never win the Oilers a Stanley Cup
It ain't a hockey debate if we don't mention Antarctica.
You're not a real hockey fan until you watch NZJHL games in the middle of the night
4-1
This is the first-ever time these teams meet each other.
useless fact:  Czech goalie (and former Catamount) Blanka Škodová has also made appearances for the Czech *inline* hockey national team
I'm impressed. Sure, we're trailing as everyone expected, but the girls actually play a somewhat\* competitive game and have killed both penalties.
Czechia throwing some _beautiful_ hip checks tbh. Just not allowed here lol.
Score: 2-1   Shots: 14-7   Faceoffs: 18-9  Kinda amusing to see everything in the same ratio after the 1st.
also don't forget the czechs are doing this without their normal starter
MPP MVP
MPP is a cheat code
i think my judgment in this game is - czech top end can absolutely hang with CAN/USA, especially up front. but they don't have the depth
That was a nasty hit!
NAAAAAAAAATTTTTTTTTTTT
Earlier, Cheryl and Kenzie talked about how the atmosphere in the tournament has been fantastic, especially with the kids who come into the games, making signs and getting behind each team.   With this in mind, I'm especially looking forward to Hungary-Finland on Monday and Hungary-Germany on Tuesday. Those kids paired with the Hungarian fans are going to make for some amazing crowds!
c'mon czechs
Fuck yeah Captain Clutch.
lol Vanišová  the Czechs look unphased tbh.
Czechia looked really good in the first period. I hope they can keep it up all game. But it’s been a fun game so far, lots of speed and skill from both sides.
lol i think nat was trying so hard to dangle her way in that she ran into her own teammate
This broadcast is hilarious (in a good way).
That’s crazy to me
That’s so cool!
I agree. Honestly any team not getting blown out by Canada or the USA is impressive and they're doing much better than that.   Really amazing for the women's game to have more competitive nations.
Kinda reminding me of watching the baseball team against Japan and Korea at WBC, lol
For real! And two of these goals are from Poulin, so on the grand scale how much can that count? 😂 But seriously the compete level has been excellent, and they look so much crisper than the opening game against Japan.
They should rename the women's team to the Hip Czechs
Dude it was a beautiful hip check… you just can’t do that here 😂
She looks so good!!!
You and I both know that Hungarian hockey fans are a very well kept secret.   Most don't see them much bc they tend to be in the second tier of WC on the men's side, and they don't produce NHL guys so why would most people watch them. But they're fucking *electric* and travel well
But it kinda makes sense.  This is the Czechs' first appearance in group A, so they couldn't've ever met Canada in the groupstage. And for a long time, top 2 teams received a bye to the semis, while the Czech team never managed to get into the semifinal.  The Championship has only expanded to 10 teams in 2019, eliminating byes. Czechs made it to the quarterfinal every time since then, meeting Finland there every single time. The only time they won was in 2022, but they met the US in the semifinal, missing Canada.   And at the Olympics, the Czechs meet the US in the quarterfinal.  So... yeah, somehow they kept missing each other all the time.
>Honestly any team not getting blown out by Canada or the USA is impressive...  Still over a period to go.
It was textbook!
That's cause she is :) on her day I genuinely think she's the program's most talented player ever. Just so fun to watch with the puck and responsible defensively.
Hell the Czechs weren't even regularly in this division until a few years ago
That’s what $13m a year gets you, number one spot on the charts
Tony D - his play is so nice that he makes the list twice
Make sure to check on your Canucks brethren this Easter
The Canucks really gave up the 9th overall pick just to dump a bunch of expiring deals and acquire the worst contract in the NHL. That’s like, impressively bad asset management
3 DMen on the ice and still worst? Ouch
Brian Dumoulin being effectively washed defensively means he can no longer compensate for Letang's risky and mistake-prone style of play.  Not shocking at all to see them in this list.
Oh so I see Oliver Ekman-Larsson has brought his “I swear I’m a defenseman” antics to Vancouver.
Ben Chiarot is a hockey terrorist
That’s our defense for the foreseeable future
oof, the canucks have 3 Dmen and they are still #1...   /s
Good thing chiarot-seider pairing hasnt been played in three months and seider-walman are one of the best in the league
Hamonic would be fine in a # 6-7 role. As a #4, and lately a #2-3, he’d probably be dead last if not for Sanderson
Now Jack Johnson is at a 2ppg with the Avalanche. Confirming that he's the top Dman in the NHL.
The Canucks have 3 guys on one defense line and they're still shit /s
Broberg/Bouchard still winning the goal share 😎 Oilers hockey babey
I take issue with the phrase “worst defensive pairings” when both Sabres duos have a higher xGF than against.
That D’Angelo signing just looks worse and worse. Thanks, Fletcher.
It's weird considering OEL-Myers was actually pretty good last season
This does not surprise me.
I dont understand how Myers is even still in the league.  He was an absolute liability everytime he was on the ice when he was with the Jets and it doesnt look like things have improved.
Thank goodness Vancouver traded all their bad contracts that were expiring at the end of the season  to have OEL until 26-27.
Surprised Gavrikov is on there, he's been great with the Kings! Maybe easier minutes, different structure? Couldn't be happier from what I've seen so far.  Absolutely expected to see Durzi...
Should use XGA , goals against can be misleading when poor goaltending is involved
I’m glad the Chiarot Seider line ended, took too long but glad it’s over.
This is fine
Christ, DeAngelo is on here twice lol
Top pairing has 3 players and is still worst, smh.
Guhle and Savard have actually been quite good. They’ve often been used as a #1 pair, which isn’t what they are, but they did well, all things considered.
Erik Karlsson is nowhere to be seen on this list and people are doubting his upcoming Norris complaining about his defense
Miro keeping Suter off the list
Jfc split Durzi and Roy, Todd
People like to downvote when i’m always on Letang and his terrible turnovers, awareness, out of position, playing angles…etc. yes extremely talented & well conditioned, it’s just his very average to below average defensive instincts that i can not stand.
I think Hellebuyck saved a couple guys from being on here.
Fuckin shitrot
Well at least both the Sabres pairings on here are out scoring their GA numbers.
Ben Chariot is a terrorist.
Everyone expects Karlsson to be there, but he’s not.
I shudder at the thought of the calamity that would be a Chiarot-Oesterle pairing .  . .
Can I say this list seems skewed downhill toward higher TOI players? Please fill me in if my quick glance over is wrong.
I'm waiting for the 'adjusted' statistic that makes the rangers look worse.  Also, I'm shocked Miller is so far down there, for multiple reasons.  Having Lindgren out so long put a strain on our D so of course tired guys will let more slip, and Miller is NOTORIOUS for getting out of position while chasing pucks.  Still love the player, but a pure defenseman he is not.  Fucking dude doesn't even hit that much!
Having pairings on there with a positive goals for percentage is baffling to me.
Provorov/Deangelo are both assholes
I know they aren't good or anything, but take into account oel and myers played in front of a Delia Martin tandem pretty much all season
Does moneypuck model anything well?
Oooh seider is showing up on this list?? Feels like he fell off the honor roll into the detention list.
For fuck sake Dorion, do not extend Hamonic, let him go. He's a 7th defender at best since he's so slow and DJ will keep playing him in the top 4
This can't be possible, I don't see any leafs defensemen in the top 20  (and I'm a leafs fan..)
Chiarot and Seider is a surprising one in the top 5. There was a lot of chatter about Chiarots contract but I thought that would be a good pairing.
Kinda surprised to see Seider’s pairing on there?  I know Chiarot isn’t a top tier guy but he must be dragging that boy down pretty bad lol
But Sanderson and Seider are GOATED everyone told me?!?
How is Suter/Heiskanen not on this list
For the majority of these pairings, you could look at them listed with no numbers attached and see why they wouldn’t work, be it two offensive players, young guys, mediocre-bad skating…there are a few surprises just looking at the names, but not many
Why would St. Louis put two OFD together?
🔥 best D in the league? Worst goaltending? lol
Wooo only one Ducks pairing there, (we would likely have way more of we had like the second page though....)
Benning was a terrible GM. Don't know how you could think Myers and OEL could be top 4 Ds, especially at their current cap hits.
Man would not have expected to see Krug-Faulk up there
Why do teams keep signing Hamonic?!
NUMBER ONE BABY
Interesting to see Borgen on here: he and soucy were one of the top pairings in the league earlier in the year  Not surprising to see big rig tho :/
Lotta former Jets here
Surprised to see Gavrikov-Peeke as the only Blue Jackets on here, though I assume that’s because it’s the only Blue Jackets players who weren’t injured for a good chunk of the games.
Crazy that the Canucks line is so bad even with 3 defensemen out there.
Let me guess: The only reason the Caps aren't on this chart is because of 1) all the fucking injuries and 2) Laviolette's tendency to put forward lines and defensive pairings in a blender.
🤦‍♂️
Krug was great at scoring, but I feel the way the Blues play, undersized.
Two giraffes in one team
Damn Parayko regressed that hard? That's a shame.
I refuse to acknowledge Will Borgen slander and I won't respond to it
Props to Tony D for being the only guy on here twice
Can’t blame Maatta when Osterle is a plug
Making the top 20 worst defensive pairing list once is cool, but do you know what's cooler?
Fortunately we acquired Gavrikov, who, despite also being on the list, has been pretty good for us, and allowed us to break up the Durzi/Roy pairing. Roy is good, but not enough to cover for the defensive liability that is Durzi playing on his off side.
Tony D is made it 2x.
hamonic is like a fuckin traffic cone im surprised he didnt drag sanderson to #1
I know Columbus has had so many injuries they can almost never field the same line up 2 nights in a row, surprised they only have one pairing in the top 20 worst pairing. And half that pairing isn’t even with the team anymore.
Provorov Deangelo really is offensively bad
Jim benning “I’m trying to save my job” trade
Deangelo managing to drag either partner down. Hated that signing from day one. Trash
Look, we don’t play defence, we have one mode.   Score more.
LGRW.  This data is worthless.
Good news, Vancouver fans, is that Myers and OEL are locked into super expensive, long term, negative value contracts.
Every once in awhile, I miss nick leddy   Not at the moment
Someone on Reddit told me Savard was an upgrade replacement for Weber and I think about that every day
We're number 1! We're number 1!
Canucks still worst despite using 3 defensemen.
I'm digging Power/Jokiharju.   The full "fuck it, goals either way" pairing.
Who the fuck needs Dylan Guenther when you can have OEL topping the league like this!
We're also paying 13 mil and we're not even the top spot  Ridiculous how good the value for van those deals are
Yeah, but it's also the only entry on the list with 3 members so that's hardly fair.
Yeah who needs a top 10 pick and $12M in cap space.
The gap isn’t small either. They didn’t _narrowly_ edge anyone out. The gap between 1st and 2nd on this list is the same as the gap between 2nd and 6th.
Blues are $23.5m for their top 4 and both pairs are on there lol
What playing in front of Spencer Martin will do to ya. Oh, and also being awful at hockey. Not a winning combo.
Say what you will about Canucks management over the last few years, but they get results.  Results may vary
The Jim Benning special
Usually I won’t chime in on somebody else’s team. But Vancouver fucked up big time when they acquired ELM. I knew it instantly no need to sit back and wait to see how it works out lol  For me the writing was already on the wall. I mean they got rid of a shitty contract in the process. But that went nowhere fast
🏆
Ahem.. thats $13.260 million TYVM
Can't believe Chletcher traded actual assets for that Jabron.
The Tony D - Provorov pairing has gotta the least popular pairing in the league right now.
I think this proves TDA is worse than Risto.
I mean fuck Tony D and fuck Provorov, but that pairing is at 50% GF on a shitty team.   This has a dumb clickbait title of “worst pairings” when it’s just “highest GA/60 pairings with over 300 minutes together”. Some of them are just high event pairings that actually help their team. Power-Jokiharu is on this list with a 52.8% GF pairing. Buffalo just plays high event hockey.
So glad we dumped that POS. He gets booed at his home arena when he has the puck. Who has that happen?
I ate a whole pizza last night and for some reason had a sore stomach this morning, other than that I'm good.  Thanks for checking on me!
Check your kid's Easter eggs, mine contained a OEL-Myers pairing
I remember when the Oilers played the Canucks in Bruce's last game and he matched up OEL/Myers against McDavid and I just felt bad for Vancouver.
> “11th best Goals For”  oh nice.   with 26 million $ salary on defensemen, surely we must at least be around 15-19th in the standings   > “5th most Goals Against”  😑
I would, but I'm afraid of getting caught in the chaos that always follows them around.
Sounds like ownership was the driving force behind that deal too which makes it infinitely worse.
Next they’ll hire Fletcher.
Fuck Jim Benning
+ a 2nd round pick too
We did get Garland who has been... Okay. Sure would rather Guenther in the system though.
💯
Very surprised to see them so low. I feel like I ways see Letang on the ice when we give one up
Letang needs his Paul Martin type player. Same thing with Brent Burns. PaulMart out there gettin people Norris Trophy’s and none of the accolades
"I swear I can play hockey"
Making Mo Seider look bad is frankly incredible. In pretty sure Chiarot-Hronek and Chiarot-Maatta are near the bottom of this list too, just off this list  He's analytically atrocious
Still was worth an unprotected first in 2023 somehow!
Hoping St Louis will use those future considerations if Vrana keeps tearing it up…
Gave up a first for him as a half-season rental 😵‍💫
Defensive black hole
[Seider was one of the most scored on defensemen at even strength last season too.](https://www.nhl.com/stats/skaters?report=goalsForAgainst&reportType=season&seasonFrom=20212022&seasonTo=20212022&gameType=2&position=D&filter=gamesPlayed,gte,1&sort=evenStrengthGoalsAgainst&page=0&pageSize=50 ) Red Wings fans blamed his defensive partner then as well.  Edit: Added link to stats. 12th highest GA.
4.75m til 2026 btw
Truth
It’s beautiful for a rebuild. Tho I think they revert to the mean alittle. Doubt they are as bad as this season next season
4th highest D cap hit at $29.2m.
3 firsts can make things happen though. DA might be able to pull something off.
I was just thinking about that pairing, Chiarot must've been one hell of an anchor there, obviously not the good kind.
It's been a crazy year for Mo. He looked off to start the year and him and chiarot were terrible together. Then he gets paired with walman and they have been nothing short of elite from their first game together. Legitimately one of the best pairings in the league. All the while getting some of the hardest matchups in the league
Yeah and almost all those minutes were played in the first half of the season when the team wasn’t clicking as well. Both those guys are best paired with a shutdown D (Ekholm-Bouchard has been awesome)
It's not xG here, it's GF and GA
It's because the team played with structure 5v5 under Shaw, but he left in the off-season to go coach with Torts again.   Once Shaw and Walker left, the 5v5 and PK went back to being shit
He was that way in Buffalo too!
When he plays 1st pairing minutes, no bueno. In the 2 toughest games against the Oilers and Golden Knights where hes played 1st pairing with Doughty, they have the worst defensive impact.           Good thing Mikey is coming back soon or we were genuinely screwed.
Advanced analytics arent kind to bad teams and aren’t the end all be all many people see them to be  He was also playing first pair minutes with peeke whos and third pairing d man
Keep in mind, Gavrikov also was on the worst team in the league. Goaltending this season with Elvis was BAD.
And it really should be the relative net of xGF - xGA.  I'll take a high event pairing so long as is a net expected positive differential.
This chart really doesn’t make me think most of these pairings were bad. GA/60 wasn’t a good measure to use
Oh, last time I said something similar about him not appearing on the worst defensive pairings it turns out he was like literally on the next pairing that just missed the list lmao
That’s because his defense is average at best and his offense is top tier elite. He’s not terrible defensively, he just isn’t good. Although I would say it’s incredibly hard to put up those kind of points without it affecting your defensive game. No reward without some risk as you will.
That's because he only has one pair that hit 300 mins together and they sit at 25th so still not good. Lower the requirements to 150 mins and hes on the 5th and 26th worst pairs.
For some reason, none of our pairs are on this list. What the fuck?
He can be pretty damn bad defensively (last night, very involved in three goals against with the Avs moving the puck all through his space with ease) but it doesn’t matter as much if he’s got the puck in the other teams zone.    I’d like to see where he’s at on an expanded list, and a mixture of stats instead of just goals against which removes a bunch of context   I’m not a nerd so idk of this how it works, but I wouldn’t be surprised if not so much the number of chances against his team increases when he’s present, but maybe the quality of those chances increases, if that’s what makes the bigger models say he’s bad defensively. He plays pretty fast and loose positionally some games I’ve watched, with those occasional less than stellar coverage
As a fan of an opposing team, Letang is not a good defender. He is a good offensive defenseman but definitely needs a rock partner and good goaltending to bail him out.
He’s only on 1 pair that qualifies and they are 25th worst lol. If you drop the requirement to 150 minutes together, he’s on both the 5th worst and 26th worst pairs.
I think most of it is from the start of the season. Trouba was injured and playing poorly, and Gallant refused to bench him. They gave up a lot of goals and it's one of the reasons we started so poorly.
It's measuring most GA/60. It's not measuring +/-  If you score 100 a game but let in 90, you're by far the worst defensive team in the league. You're just winning most games because of your offense
Other Canucks tandems played in front of that tandem and aren't on this list.
Yeah on these kind of charts they should use XGA. There is some d pairs who got absolutly carried by goalies, and some that went down because of goalies
There's nothing modeled here. It's just raw goals for and goals against presented in a few different ways. Nothing on here about expected goals or any advanced stats.  The Sabres pairs on here have a high goals against but also a high goals for, which matches the eye test of people calling the Sabres chaotic and high event.
They have Buffalo's playoff odds at < 1%. Sounds pretty accurate to me.
No, but it's free to the public, so people lap it up.
He got pulled down hard by Chiarot. He's been excellent away from him.
wrong. Mccabe is there with Jones from chicago
Ngl i thought that too, probably worst singning that Yzerman has ever made lmao.
I mean Seider whit Walman as his D pair is/was "best" defensive pairing per money puck. Chiarot is god awful.
Even our lord and savior Nick Lidström wouldnt be able to drag Ben Chiarot to positive numbers tbh. But noted best defenseman in the league Jake Walman got Seider on top of these charts.   Jake Walman for Norris!
Listen, it’s all oleksiak. And at least they’re last on the list instead of first. Borgy is the only reason they aren’t
Say it with me r/hockey:  Fuck Jim Benning  Fuck Aquilini
results haven't varied too much tbh
And doubled down by resigning him
"The Bigotry Pair"
Risto while not that good has shown he takes to coaching, listens, and is able to at least give 100% out there.   Torts has learned how to use him, and seems to respect him.  He absolutely eviscerated Risto early in the season. Now, he’s praised him the past few months, even calling him the teams top defenseman a few games.   TDA, as Torts said, “we didn’t know just how bad defensively he was”, “a liability on the ice” and has no clue what to even do with TDA to shelter or help him.
… you’re going to do it again tonight, aren’t you?
Tbh you can’t hurt us we’re already dead.
Rutherford is giving jobs to all his Pittsburgh friends, I already expect him to bring in Hextall when he gets fired from Pittsburgh this summer
OEL-Myers was something else, man. I don't care how washed Dumoulin is, he isn't a chaos giraffe
At least the stats have liked Chiarot-Edvinsson recently
And him and Walman are top 10 this year. He was just dog with Chiarot
Yeah, but Danny DeKeyser was his partner for a majority of it lol
He has some of the toughest matchups too though
This is something to do with him winning the Calder isn't it?
Hope he doesn’t turn into a Provorov.
Parayko hasn't been good since he signed his extension, Krug has come nowhere near what we got him for, and Faulk is doing fine. Leddy got a hilarious overpayment after one ok stint. This team won't get better unless something changes at the blue line.
They were pretty bad last season too.  I don't think it's a one off.
Where is Broberg these days?  Just checked his stats and he only has two games played in the AHL.  I hope the team is getting him ice time.  Would like to see him take a spot in the bottom 4 full time next season.
I don’t even remember them playing together. Maybe I blocked it out
Ahhhh yes I see that thanks. Point stands though
Ya, I’m wondering how much of it is the individual player’s fault and how much is it a systemic team problem.   Canucks fans told Sabres fans Riley Stillman was the worst dman in the NHL and he’s actually been decent for us. Our bottom pair used to be a major problem for us and since Stillman came, it’s been a positive for us
Glad to hear about Mikey, he's our best asset if we play EDM in the 1st round. Fingers crossed Fiala & Villardi come back soon too
GA/60 is not even that advanced, it's just derived from some basic math  It takes zero outside factors into account. Like yes, OEL-Myers were shit at defending, but the Canucks also had the worst team sv% for like 75% of the season. That punishes everyone beyond not being good defensively  The issue with analytics is that lots of people try to draw conclusions from them while using zero context
Just looked and apparently Megna-Karlsson is 25th at 2.79 GA/60. So not 21st at least lol! And Megna is on the Kraken now too so idk where Karlsson is at since then. Not 300 minutes with anyone else I guess
A lot is the system the team plays too.   Dahlin, power and sammuelsson are all very good defensively.   Problem is that our system is take risks, all the time so odd are they are behind the other teams net at least 5 times a game each, leads to some high danger chances for, and against.
150 minutes is about 6 games for Karlsson minutes though.
yeah troubs was injured and played through it for a while at the beginning of the year. the team was brutal until he flipped out and threw his helmet in disgust.
I doubt any other combination of our 16 defensemen has played enough minutes to reach the cut off except Hughes and Schenn
Right, but this is billed as “worst pairings”
That part is about right
They are just counting goals while players on the ice here. It isn't a model or fancy stats. You just don't like them because you have a boner for the Rangers.
Yea, I'm sure he'll be fine. Just ribbin ya.
Ah - good catch. Ok this poll is legit.
Fuck messier
How dare you bad mouth that beautiful man!
That's not even a stat that's in the graphic, but aight?
Resigning? He was an offseason FA. He has been hot garbage though. Luckily the term was short.
And just for good measure, so am I.
Chiarot since he has returned from injury has actually looked decent. Him and Edvinsson have been a surprisingly decent pairing. Look forward to that being the definitive #2 pairing next season
How long has he been playing with Walman? I checked Seider’s GA for the past month, and he has the 37th highest. Much better, but certainly not top 10. Maybe I’m going back too far?  Edit: [I went to moneypuck.com, and they have Seider-Walman 59th](https://moneypuck.com/lines.htm)  The link doesn’t auto sort so you have to change expected goals to goals. Then, you have to click the goals against/60 column.
That’s what I’m saying. Y’all blamed Dekeyser last season and now blame Chiarot this season. I’m not saying y’all are wrong for doing so, but at some point, it’s gotta be at least a little bit on Seider as well, no?
All 4 of them have a NTC.   (But we couldn’t give Petro a NMC?)
He's basically our 7D since we got Ekholm  Tough for him to get minutes over our top 3 LD right now (Nurse, Ekholm, Kulak), but he'll be just fine  Still getting games here and there when we go 11-7
7th d-man for us and comes on once in a while. Desharnais basically took his spot as our 6th for us. he’s been playing
Being kept away from the ice, thank god. I hope he develops, but he's been genuinely awful in any NHL appearance this year.
lol Same. That many games together? TF
Probably is even greater in this case since instead of hypothetical goals you're talking real goals over a pretty solid sample size.
It shows doesn't matter how solid a player is if the rest of the team is bad.  Look at how many players have turned it around, fancy stats wise, for better or worse depending on the team. Just look at other players who are 1-2 years in with a new team like CBJ/ANA or BOS/CAR.
makes sense that he dodged a placement on a technicality. People were posting that Mackinnon overtime goal the other night and no one pointed out Karlsson's excellent overtime work with a perfect assist on the goal. Guy drives me absolutely nuts. Skilled and a total liability.
They are more clickbait than serious stats. “Worst pairings” gets more clicks than “highest GA/60” even if some of these “worst” pairs have positive GF%. Same deal with calling it a “deserve to win meter” instead of a “cumulative expected goal meter”.  It makes sense that Reddit laps it up. It provides something close to reality that makes you feel serious and smart, nevermind that it’s not actually what it says it is.
It’s pretty obvious they hate the Rangers at this point. For years now.
Fuck yeah dave
Hell yeah Dave!
Misread the graphic, my bad
Between comments i forgot which terrible dman trade we were talking about and my head went to risto.
Nope, he was our RFA. You gave us a 4th, 3rd, and 2nd over 3 drafts for the RIGHT to pay him $5 million a year.
What drove Chiarot’s WAR way down has always usually been his love for the penalty box. His defensive impact was usually fine, and his offensive impact was below average, but nothing to be really mad about. I’m surprised at how bad he’s been this year even ignoring the penalties, happy to hear he’s been doing better lately!
Right, you're using a terrible stat because none of the representative ones back you up
I was looking at xGA/60
I’m guessing you don’t watch many Wings games.
You’re telling me you wouldn’t blame DDK? He was a staple in his prime, but the downfall through countless injuries proved him a liability in the twilight of his career.   Of course, it’s never *just* going to be Seider’s partner. Unless your name is Lidstrom wearing #5 in a Wings sweater, you’re not a perfect human. Seider has been burned, yes. He’s had bad games, yes. However, the pairing of 96-53 is WORLDS better than 8-53.
Every single partner Chiarot has been eith this seen has seen a massive drop in performance for the duration of them being partners. As soon as Chiarot left Seider's pair Seider started playing like a true #1 defenseman.  So yeah, Ben Chiarot fucking sucks.
It can be a lot more complicated than just good team making players look better.   Teams play different systems and some players skill set or lack thereof will fit on more or fewer teams systems. That’s more about the player than the team. There’s plenty of players who measure awful in a variety of stats despite great teams, and there’s players who look amazing on awful teams   I’d barely call goals against fancy stats tho
Lmao shut up nerd
It would definitely have been more interesting to include though. I don't completely trust it as a stat but it can at least account for goaltending. It's 2.94 xGA/60 for that pair. Actually not that horrible.
Hey now. That’s our beloved five million dollar man. Whenever I see the crying Terrell Owens meme I think of Risto haha
🎶 *Ding dong, Fletcher’s gone. Fletcher’s gone, Fletcher’s gone.* 🎶
Doesn’t help that he and Seider were the most disjointed D pair I’ve ever seen, or that they got the hard assignments
What are you talking about? It’s the same stat as the one in the OP. GA from the NHL website in my original comment, and GA/60 from Money Puck in the added edit.
xGA/60 has them at 21st  Edit: Changing to a higher minimum ice time raises them up the list. So compared to other teams top pairings, they’d rank around 5th right now. Hopefully they keep it up.
He's just salty Seider won the Calder over Zegras
I never said I wouldn’t blame Deskeyser. I would most certainly lay most of the blame with his play last season. All I’m saying is that at least some of the blame should still be placed on Seider. Two seasons in a row near the top of the league in GA/60 with different D partners isn’t a great look. I don’t know why that’s so upsetting. It just shows there’s room for improvement.   A lot of Red Wings fans treat any type of criticism of Seider’s game like a personal attack. I just don’t get that.
Which makes it even weirder he has a fanboy in the Wings subreddit who happens to be so goddamned negative about everything else.
Close to 100 points - and is a -16. Let that resonate for awhile.
I’m salty? Lmao. Y’all are the ones that downvote every response. Legitimately can’t take the lightest of criticisms.
I think you would need check performance over replacement relative to competition, if you really want to get fancy.  Red wings are not very good at defending and were even worse last year.  Seeing d guys who play the most ice on a bad team isn't surprising.
Lmao this idiot doesn't understand basic stats lmao
Haven't DV'd a thing, its just clear in your mind that Sieder is massively over rated and when someone challenges you by saying 'hes played with bad d partners on a bad team' you just go 'b-b-b-but the stats!!!'
I'm not trying to get fancy lol. I'm literally just referring to the stat this post is about. That's it. I'm not saying Seider is a bad defenseman. I'm saying this particular stat that the post is about has been bad for two years.
Spirited debate. Like talking to a brick.
Because I said he could be at least somewhat responsible for his own stats that's me saying he's "massively overrated"? Get a grip. Like I said, y'all can't take the slightest criticism, and it's mind boggling.
It's not a debate, you just don't understand hockey stats lmao
It’s not “criticism” it’s blatant inflammatory comments without any stats to back it up and then accusing others of feeling the way you feel. Fuck off back to Disneyland and continue to watch your team waste John Gibsons career
One of if not both Tarasenko & Kane.
Orlov will be gone. I think Clifton will get a deal the Bruins won’t be able to match due to the cap crunch. Don’t think we’ll bring back Nosek or Hathaway either, the fourth line will have to be really cheap next year. There’s been some talk of trying to keep Bertuzzi but I don’t see it.
JT Compher, has had his best season, so he'll ask for 5-5.5M, and we can't afford it. Similar situation to Kadri, while obviously he isn't half as good as Kadri was last yr.
Erik Gustafsson. Doubt he'll be back when he was a option on the Caps first PP and now isn't getting into all the games.
Drouin.  The man needs some new scenery.
Nick Bjugstad. He’s been great for the Oilers so far but there’s no chance they can afford to keep him.  Klefbom… RIP the shoulder.
The entire medical staff
Quick
Ron Hextall
Freddie Andersen. He’s been outperformed by Raanta all season and his replacement is already under contract for 4 more years.
Can't see Roslovic back as a Blue Jacket. Two years in a row he was given the 2C spot and simply could not bring his A game consistently enough to deserve another chance at it.
Kevin Hayes.   Either Danny gets rid of him or Torts will mail him to Abu Dhabi.
Damon Severson and Miles Wood.
Idk what the fuck we gonna do with Lehner.
Victor Olofsson. Which is probably weird to hear since he has 26 goals but that is legit all he does and if he isn’t scoring he is useless. The Sabres have no problem scoring anymore and will probably flip him for defense help. He’s been scratched lately with our team healthy.
Feels like a guarantee that one of Boeser or Garland are gone. We have too many wingers and not enough cap space.
Ian cole. He just sucks
Ryan Murray. Sadly I thing the guys career is finished. He can not stay healthy
I’d be pretty surprised if roslovic isn’t traded. Especially if we get a center in this draft.   Incredibly inconsistent only shows up the last 20 games of the year
Cam Talbot and Nick Holden
Do coaches count?
Now that Edler has 1000 GP, I think he’s (hopefully) done. He was significantly worse this year, but overall, he was a fine 3rd pair guy and good veteran presence.   I also have to think that Cal Petersen’s time is up with the Kings. They’ve given him plenty of rope, and the fact that he hasn’t been called up since being sent down to the Reign in November is telling. Unnecessarily signing him to that contract was a terrible move by Rob Blake.
Griess is gone.
Unless JT Compher signs a sweetheart deal with us, he’s gonna walk and get paid. I hate it, he’s been a long time member and his value is probably understated by most.
Damon Severson.    He’s going to want term and there’s absolutely no shot he’s going to sign short term. And there’s absolutely no shot we offer him longer than 3 years when our right side already has Hamilton and Marino. That’s before even mentioning Nemec. Too much invested in RD.
Someone said JT but Eric Johnson is almost certainly not coming back unless he takes a near vet minimum deal
Matt Dumba unfortunately.
Miles Wood  Up until this year he’s been a serviceable-to-good 4th liner but he’s getting paid over $3m to produce at less than a $1m pace. He’s been bad defensively and always seems to take boneheaded penalties at the worst possible time.   But he’s really good at getting at least one breakaway a game (that he won’t score on), so, there’s that I guess.
The Staals (hopefully) are the only ones I can easily place money on not being with us next year
Loooooooch  In fairness to him, he hasn't been bad. He's basically been exactly as advertised. It's just time. Contract's up and there's a promising crop of guys coming up from the farm that will be fighting for spots.
If scheifele is still with the team next year there’s no excuses left for keeping cheveldayoff wmployed
Roslovic is gone. He had a shot but he just can’t bring 100% until the end of every season. People talk about how Laine used to disappear. I believe it’s because he’s so big that you notice when he’s doing nothing. Meanwhile, Roslovic is straight up invisible 80% of the year.
I don't see how we can afford to Keep Bunting around in TO.
I think Bergeron could go for a few more years if he wants to as long as we keep finding ways to reduce his workload, but this should probably be the end for Krejci. Playmaking-wise, he’s still good enough to stick around, his game was never predicated on speed he’s just one of the cerebral players that thinks the game really well. But his lack of foot speed is starting to hurt him in other areas of the game that it didn’t in years past and he’s looked noticeably gassed over the past month-ish. If I had to guess he goes all out for what’s hopefully a deep playoff run and then calls it a career.  Besides him, barring a massive trade to free cap space we’re probably gonna need to let all three of our deadline acquisitions walk.
Gonna start putting Jeff Carter retirement vibes out there since that's the only way he'll be gone
Sadly I think Borowiecki is done. I hope the team finds a way to bring him back in an off-ice capacity.
Brian Dumoulin I hope.
Reimer. If we want a 30+ year old goaltender to man the pipes we can just resign Dell for cheaper than what Reimer would want
Ryan Suter
I just don't see any way Josh Bailey is in an Islanders uniform come October
I love the guy, but Anthony Stolarz is gone for sure.  Lukas Dostal is our up-and-comer goalie from the AHL and ready to be a full-time backup, with potential to take the #1 job from Gibson in a few years.  It hurts because Stolarz has been a solid backup. I hope a team takes him.
Shit. They already left.
Thomas Greiss and I won’t be sad to see him go.
We already sold most of them so I would say: Khaira, Tinordi, Englund, and Stalock all seem like they’ll definitely be gone. Mitchell and Toews are very very likely gone but I would put them just a hair under 100%, I can see a scenario where they stay.  Athanasiou could definitely sign elsewhere but the team seems to like him and meh, I would not be mad about him sticking around for a few more rebuild years. We’ll see though, he’s probably 50/50. Another defenseman is probably gone too but hard to exactly who (I am personally assuming Caleb Jones), we just have so many younger guys eyeing NHL time next year so someone has to go.  I hope trash like Katchouk and Reese Johnson are no longer on the team but no certainty they’ll be moved lol
Wevr got a few players who just kinda fill holes in our roster while we wait for prospects that expire at the end of the year. Guys like Chiasson, Erne, Oesterle, Hagg.   At least Oesterle and Hagg are gone for sure. The 2 forwards are a solid chance of not coming back either
Cam Talbot
Holl.  McCabe at 50% retained is his current cap hit.  I also think Kerfoot is likelier than most think to be kept around if it's a cheap contract.
David Rittich and that’s just fine.
Miles Wood!
JVR, Braun, Hayes, Laczynski, Bellows, Allison
Hayes and provorov.
Freddie
Cam Talbot, Nic Holden and Austin Watson.
Olofsson
So long Olofsson and Bryson
Caps have five pending UFA’s who didn’t get extended:  Smith  Sheary   Irwin  Hagelin  Brown  I assume every one of them will be gone.
Milan Lucic
Please be Lehner.  That jersey purchase didn’t age well
Probably not many from the leafs, depends on the playoffs results of course but that's not 100% right now. I'd say Gustafson, Bunting, Kerfoot
According to Maple Leaf fans: McDavid
Tanner Pearson for me. I just think his hand injury will be risky if he plays next season considering the amount of treatment and time for it to heal he's getting.
Jvr. Hayes, ‘eangelo, and hopefully Provorov
OEL seems like a player every team will want, so we'll start the bid at a 7th round pick.
I'd hope Kuznetsov is gone, his value has gotten worse and I feel it's time to cut him lose and get as much as we can back for him. This team might not make the playoffs next year, having him doesn't make sense to me if we aren't a good enough team to reasonably compete come playoff time
TOR could be in a heap of trouble if Samsonov gets to RFA and gets his bag elsewhere (if the Leafs can’t match)  That would leave the Leafs with Murray and Woll between the pipes    Fucking ***yikes***  Edit for UFA/RFA confusion on my end
Lucic, Lewis, Ritchie. Good riddance.
Tyler Myers 😏
Myers
Zach Parise and Semyon Varlamov are both as good as gone.
Talbot
Wood, Sevo, Tatar, and possibly Graves.
Miles wood (I hope)
I’d guess most of them
Toews
Toews will be gone for sure
Mark Pysyk. He's been on IR all season. No sense in re-signing him.
Dubois
Hopefully Nick Ritchie. I have nothing against the dude, he fits in alright but he's holding a permanent spot from guys like Pelletier, Duehr, Coronato, and maybe Zary next year.
Josh Bailey is gonna be bought out I think. Longest serving guy, will be sad to see him go, but unfortunately he's gone downhill.
Kerfoot and Holl
Kevin Hayes, JVR, Proverov. Retain salary, retain salary, get a decent pick/prospect for.
Kerfoot
Jason Zucker has objectively been the best penguin player this year as far as expectations go and we are probably going to fucking lose him
Hellberg and Erne
Nazem Kadri if we keep Darryl Sutter
Edler
Zucker
All the fixings
Murray and Bunting
Anthony Mantha
Cam Talbot.
Reimer
God I hope it's Mike Hoffman
Hopefully Johansen, that contract is horrible, Duchene can’t stay healthy and another anchor contract, Jankowski and our awful coach. But truthfully I wouldn’t be surprised to see Borocop gone just because he’s not looking as someone to be returning and we’ll know Arizona loves guys on LTIR or who can’t/don’t play anymore, Sanford plain sucks and Asplund…well I forgot he was even on the roster
matt murray gonna get traded or bought out. and if justin holl comes back i'm letting reddit decide my next team and i will disown the leafs.
Jonathon quick. Dude is terrible
Kane.
Think Calgary makes a lot of changes   Lucic, vladar, lewis, Ritchie, big surprise will be hanifin assuming kylington comes back
Foegle. Detrimental to the team, I know.  Bouchard is going to get paid, and they’ll find a way to get Bjugstad signed.
Toews is gone. He's gonna retire, because he's still dealing with health issues. These last few games are it for him, he's almost assuredly hanging 'em up.
Martin Jones  Love what he's done for us but with Driedger coming back and Gru on that massive contract AND Daccord on standby I can't find a scenario where we can justify keeping him around
If we're lucky, Brad Larson will never return to Columbus. On the player side, Hutchinson is close to done
Jeff Carter
For the love of god Bailey please.
Definitely - Heinen Probably - Zucker  Hopefully - Carter, Doumolin Maybe- Jarry, DeSmith
Hopefully Brian Dumoulin
Jorst, mcliffy, palmer  Idk whos on my team and neither do you. But they prob wont be around too long
Barbasev, Tarasenko, Mikkola, and O’Reilly.  Oh shit hold on
So far who would you rather keep?
I feel like Bedard is actually trying to recruit Kane. Like that haircut was a major *wink wink* to him. "Hey Kaner! Come join me on whatever garbage team I get drafted to. They'll probably be able to afford you, and we'll put up a million points together" --- Bedard probably.
i doubt we can afford to keep mikkola. hes been very good, but surely hes played his way to a nice contract for himself.
I feel like I’ve heard a lot more buzz that Kane is decently realistic; that his “decision” to leave Chicago in the first place was simultaneously a ballot of approval to be in NY long term.  Now a crap playoffs from the team or him or both could blow that up (and I’d very, very easily pay up more for tarasenko) but I think Kane could happen.   Repercussions possibly for a guy like Goodrow here too.
Jesus imagine being stuck with Kane’s contract if he don’t retire lol.   He like I just bought a apartment in downtown Manhattan 😂 I need to play another 5 years to pay of the interest
The game has passed him by
I think if we can make bot Tarasenko and Miller happy we’re good even if we lose some pieces.  Kane for sure hasn’t played up to the dollar amount he’d be happy with.
Especially with more than likely not having a 1st line center signed. Bruins center core after this year is gonna struggle
Hathaway is the only one who's cheap enough to consider keeping I think.
Add in trying to resign swayman past his entry level contract….
Bertuzzi was the one guy I said when I opened this thread. I know Orlov will probably be gone and may even wind back up in Washington but I don’t see Bertuzzi playing for the black and gold next year considering he was a rental piece pretty much with Hall and Foligno out.
man id fucking love orlov and bert to stay, the others it would hurt to see go but i wouldnt be too upset (besides maybe cliffy). chances of bert and orlov (or one or the other) staying though: slim to none.
Cliffys the big one for me. I know the bruins usually resign the trade deadline acquisitions but this year it felt obvious they were just that. Resigning any of those guys seems like a pipe dream to me. But no way Clifton’s going to be making 1m again next year and I just don’t see the bruins having the money to resign him. RIP Cliffy Hockey
I think we can keep Hathaway cheap but there’s no shot we keep Bertuzzi or Orlov
Bertuzzi is definitely gone considering we already have Marchy, JD and Hall at LW. Hathaway has a chance to stay though.
I also think Helm just because of all the injuries this year.
I really don't see him leaving. I think Rodriguez will be gone. Landy will be back so we still need that defensive forward. EJs contract ends and I really have a feeling he isn't coming back.   Eller is also leaving too. I think if you get Compher at a 4-4.5 mil contract, that's worth it. Newhook hasn't done enough to warrant anything more than a 1-1.5 mil bridge deal.   Losing Compher is just a huge hole. He's the defensive forefront and provides that perfect amount of complimentary offense.
Last I checked he only had a single point for the Leafs, is this still true?
He's been off for personal reasons
If he takes a cheap deal he could join his old Friend Mackinnon. But honestly the Avs are cap strapped and if he takes a similar deal to Erod this year the Avs could swing it. Cause my answer to this thread is Erod no way we can afford him.
The Habs media really mistreated him, however I think the fans have been pretty good to him, which isn't something you can say often about underperforming players who the media go after in big markets.
I haven't watched him that much this season, but is he even really an NHL-calibre player anymore?  Obviously has the talent but doesn't seem to have the production.  He's got 3rd/4th line numbers but (as far as I recall) he doesn't have the grit to play those roles.  Is his next team in Switzerland or something?
Nah, we will resign him for $2million/year and it’ll be a great contract for years to come.  Dude is second on the team in assists, and he missed a bunch of games
Idk what his ask is but he’s the exact mold of the type of player Mike Sullivan likes (assuming he isn’t fired)
Holy shit I knew Klefbom had been gone for a while but didn't realize this was his 3rd full year out
Definitely. I would love to keep him but there’s no way he’s not gonna cash in on the great year he’s had
Smith
Wait what, why? He likes it here, and we’ll have to see what happens. I would rather offload yams than bjuggy. Yams has not been scoring and gets bullied. I love him but I would rather have some depth than someone who has fanned on 5 empty net chances.
I feel like Janmark's not coming back either. He's been good for us, but IDK if the team really needs him after this year.
Klefbom makes me so sad. I loved that guy, Big bummer
This oilers team would be a shoo in for the cup if klefbom never had that problem.  Larsson more likely to stay (klef was his best friend) Nurse doesn’t have to be the number 1 guy so his contract would probably be closer to 6 million. We’d have one of the best d in the league mixed with the best forwards in the league.
You think so?  I think he’d be a good value contract.  He wouldn’t cost more than $1.2m even with his year.  I’d bet he would take a discount if we go deep/win it all and have a shot at a couple in a row.
Dont tease me like that.
Wherever he goes, I’ll be rooting for him to get that US born goalie wins record, as long as he doesn’t do it against us.
Wrong Hextall to be getting rid of...
Jeff Carter
I feel like Freddie made the team’s decision pretty easy, I hope I’m right.
Early in the season I think he was playing a bit better than Raanta,  but this most recent injury really seems to have messed him up.   I don't think he's ever been the same since he got hurt against Colorado last Feb/Mar, but he was still serviceable until these last couple of weeks
Let’s hope so. I worry they’ll keep him but I think he’s gotta go.
Raanta has played against non-playoff teams while Freddie has played against playoff teams with few exceptions.  I don't think either of them will be back but I wouldn't say one has outplayed the other.  They have both been mediocre and carried by an excellent defense.
I don’t think we should just assume Kochetkov is fully ready to be the number 1. I also don’t think Raanta can handle the workout of a starter. So I think we will let both walk and trade for someone like Gibson/Hart or sign a starting free agent goalie for a year or two and let Kochetkov at the very least back him up and possibly steal the starting job.
No surprise. 2C was his on the Jets, but he didn't capitalize on the opportunity. No work ethic and gets lazy.  Literally had him slotted as center to Ehlers and Laine. Dropped the ball.
I’m fine moving on from any of Roslovic, Bean, Bemstrom, Elvis, Foudy
For some reason there’s loads of rumors that we want him. I have no idea if that’s true but where there’s smoke there’s fire.
Yeah I'd be shocked if he's here next season
Sucks on sevo   See u miles
People have been saying Blackwood… Not sure about that.
Leave him on LTIRetired.
Snakepit
So does he fail the eye test spectacularly? Ive never seen a 25 goal scorer so reviled by their own fans on the internet.
This seems like a pretty positive paragraph
I’d be shocked if they don’t try to unload Myers, but of course that will cost assets (not that that’s stopped the team before)..
He’s the worst.
He can't transition the puck and takes dumbass penalties.  If you want an easy interference penalty just dump the puck in and try to go around.  He can't turn fast enough so half the time he takes the penalty.  I don't miss him.
That’s been true for 10 years now lol. The most injured man in the league.
What do you get for him though?
cam Holden Deez nuts
Players that I dont think will be back next season:           Edler (retirement?)         Petersen (trade with assets attached)        Walker (trade)           MacEwen (UFA)                 Korpisalo and Gavrikov are 50/50s, still up in the air. We can make room for them if they want to stick around. Probably involves moving the likes of Durzi, Iafallo, etc.
Good riddance. Shouldn't have signed him to begin with
The dudes faceoffs raise our average by 10% alone
I'll admit it took me until this year to truly see how much we value him
I don’t know about this. Kadri May have spoiled the well. Our 2C’s over perform because of the talent next to them. Teams may be wary to give jt big money now that everyone has seen that we take players (kadri, malgin, compher…) and make them look better then they are. I love JT tho so maybe I’m just hoping he stays.
oh man i’d love to have compher back, the sabres desperately need help on faceoffs and defense
Is he a solid 3/4 guy like the stats indicate or is it cause he’s sheltered? I can’t tell.
I really wish he would retire with us.
I don't know who would give EJ big money though. Avs can give him a 1 mil deal and he probably takes that. He is a bottom pairing defenseman on most teams and is injured a lot. Would be really sad to lose him as the longest tenured athlete in Denver.
He’s definitely the biggest name, but we’re at risk of losing a lot of other pretty important players and it sucks so much
Unless he takes league minimum he's gone. About other expiring players I hope MoJo, Gaudreau and Gustavsson are back
I think that breakaway is likely a result of him being *out* of place positionally though, not the other way around. Like he just accidentally ends up in place for a long lead pass by wandering like a lost old man in a mall parking lot.
Don’t forget Hornqvist. He may be done done.
Unpopular opinion but the staals have been fine for us
I could easily see them resigning him for one more year cheap. I would hate it, but I could see it.
The only thing I’d be pissed about if this is Scheifs last season is that my husband will have to pay to renumber/nameplate one of his jerseys.   👋🏻
You guys don't like Scheifele anymore?? What happened
His family is also living in NC I believe. He mentioned earlier in the season it was tough not having them in Boston.
As a leafs fan fuck I cannot wait for him to retire, I am sick of absolutely loving a bruins player but he is pure class.  If they win it all this year I can see a leave on top but for sure he looks like he could play longer, and sign those stupid cheap contracts that let you have other good players.
One of the biggest beauties in the league.
We'll sign him to league minimum and give him LTIRetirement so he gets that sweet health insurance forever
I’d say Jason Zucker is the more realistic answer.
I'm thinking Jarry
Fuck Aaron Dell
As much as I would like this to happen, he's signed through 2025.   Domi is probably gone, signed elsewhere.
You don't see him not being traded away and simply finishing off his contract? If they didn't trade him at his peak because he was "Mr. Islander," they're not gonna do it now. We don't have the assets to throw away for a team like Arizona to take him.
Dostal has been nothing short of phenomenal in the AHL this year behind the league’s worst defense
All my homies hate greiSS
I thought that was the plan anyway. Only signed for a year. Hofer is ready to come up. But yes, no room for a bigot on our team
"And for picks 4,6,7 and 13-21, the Chicago Blackhawks"
> Mitchell and Toews are very very likely gone but I would put them just a hair under 100%  I think if Toews had any intention of coming back next year he wouldn't have decided to try to come back for some games at the end of this year.  The Hawks signed roster for 23-24 is so bad it would struggle to beat AHL teams.
Nono we need Katchouk and Johnson as tank commanders. I think Jones stays just to make Seth happy and just have him rotate in and out. I hope AA stays just to help hit the cap floor lol
Stalock is persona non grata for KD after how well he played. Has as many wins as Mrazek. Hope he finds a nice backup role on a better team.
The only RFA I want back is Suter. His PK this year warrants another contract
Wouldn't be surprised if we give Chiasson another year. He's been huge on our power play since joining the team. I think the other 3 are gone for sure, either to the AHL as future depth roles or to free agency.
I kinda want Chiasson back, dude had some good offensive energy since being called up.
This, and Ned or Hellberg, or both.
Kerfoot isn't getting paid much his next contract
Especially with Lily out of the lineup right now, losing Holl isn’t as big of an impact as it would be. Lily and Holl have different skills but we at least already have someone to slot into his spot. It will be interesting to see if we bring Schenn back as a 7th.
No save Dave!
As a Nashville fan who hasn’t kept up with the Jets, how has Rittich performed this season?
Why Allison. The rest of those I’d agree with but he seems to be liked by the organization. Although I’d be surprised to see Laczynski completely out of the organization I figure he’ll just be AHL.
His career is over
I could see the Leafs trying to keep kerf. He's a swiss army knife.   Would love to see a good deal on Kampf.
Good thing Samsonov is an RFA so your hypothetical is a non-issue
Samsonov is 99% re-signing. He likes it here, he’s played great, and the money will be available.
Well he's an RFA. It's shocking how little you know about the team you supposedly follow
Lewis is fine for the role he's in
I think all 3 are doing decently for what they're meant to do. If anyone is underperforming, it's Kadri since the ASB. He's almost a liability out there with all his giveaways and weak play recently.
What’s wrong with Nick Ritchie? He’s been pretty good for us since we got him, better than Brett for sure.
I continue to forget that Cam Atkinson is on this team.
Bailey before these two. He's cooked.
Honestly if we could get assets for Kadri I'd be fine ditching that contract
Shocked pikachu face
Tarasenko far and away.
Vova
Yep, maybe Goodrow also out?
He’s a UFA, anyone can take him. That’s why unless dude is in love with NY and takes a wildly team-friendly deal, he’s gone.
I’m pretty confident Bergeron will be back, and he’ll probably play for scraps again. I’m also pretty confident that Krejci will leave, but Zacha has looked pretty good in the middle lately when the team has been resting Bergeron/Krejci. I’d feel fine with a 2L of Hall-Zacha-Pasta next year.
Zacha 2C and Coyle 3C is solid. We really need Bergy back for another go next year
Considering it was “his dream” to play for the Bruins. He’s one of the few players I can see taking a hometown discount.
At this point, re-signing Swayman is probably the number two priority in the offseason. First is obviously securing a top line center (which I believe will be Bergeron). After that, you take care of Swayman. I could be wrong but I don't think he'll be looking to break the bank... I think he'll take a fair but bottom of the market deal to stay.
Trade hall sign bert
Yep, we'll probably (and hopefully!) sign Nieto as his replacement, since he's been very solid for his role. Obvs not a center, but still does the same kinda job.
EJ might sign for a teamfriendly 1M. Or not. But it's a possibility.     ERod will be gone if he asks more than what he's making, he's way too inconsistent for big money.      Eller, agreed.     Compher @ 4M would be ok, but in reality I'd rather save that and get a PROPER 2C for 6-7M. Compher is a middle 6 center, not a true 2C.      Newhook, 10 000% agreed- it's sort of a blessing cap wise.. although... he would've been an easy answer for a 2C if he actually performed like one.
he's only played 8 games and got wayyy less time so yeah
For a while, yeah, but even before that he wasn't reliably in our top 6.
Yup Erod has been a great player moving and sliding thru our roster while battling injurys. If Drouin or Poolparty are willing to accept that role I hope we get one of those 2 this offseason.
If Drouin can stay healthy, I think you'd be happy with what you're getting. For the last several years, whenever he'd get going, he'd get hurt. He's had a change of mentality for the better, but he's mever really got a fair change to show it.
I hope it happens, he deserves it. He has 11 points in his last 20 games, he's not a lost cause and with some high IQ players he can create plays out of nothing. The guy just cannot shoot after fucking up his wrists.
Espesh Quebecois playing for Montreal.
He's been one of MTLs better producers in the second half of the season, he just can't score to save a life
He’s definitely an NHLer. I just want to move on from him
Jo has 29 points in 55 games on a terrible team with a shit powerplay. He could slot into most teams' top 6 pretty easily.  I see him signing 1 year with a small market, low expectation team let him focus on hockey out of the spotlight in Montreal, then get traded at the deadline if he stays healthy and builds up his value a bit.
Yeah.  Unfortunately it was a career ended.  Our team would have been so much better and sexier if we never lost him.
Yamamoto has another year left at $3.1m, he’s also well liked and still put up 24 points through a few injuries and concussion issues. There’s no chance they move him for Bjugstad.
Depends on his price, he's been a solid 25 point player. For $1.25m he's been a grinder with some potential to move up and down the lineup. Which is basically what we need, so he does have a lot of value in Woodcroft's system.
I don't think Larsson stayed regardless, because people here were complete idiots every single day with the constant "ONE FOR ONE" and saying how much they'd rather have Hall, but he also holds negative associations with losing his dad here.  But Klefbom would have 100% helped ease the load on Nurse and been exactly the defensemen we needed. But non-stop major injuries take their toll. Plus Klefbom was on a great contract at $4.1m
No chance he takes a discount to stay. He’s 30 and doesn’t have many solid earning years left given his pedigree. Maybe if he was 37 and had a year left in the tank I could see it.
> Wherever he goes  back to his roots! Columbus
Unless bingo wins count, i dont think he will be getting the record from where hes at next year  Its a retirement home joke
As is Carolina’s way.
Honestly, even when he has the work ethic, he's just inconsistent as shit. Dude is putting up 44 points in 71 games in a season from hell and he *still* has the problem where it's like his brain turns off on at random instances. Whiffs in the middle of the slot, drop passes to nowhere, random turnovers... Dude has a 4 point game followed by 5 games laying goose eggs, then gets 8 points over a 6 game point streak. Absolutely baffling. He's a Mid 6 C on average, which is to say he alternates between 1C and 4C and you just get annoyed with the man.  I'm sure some great team can get a PPG season out of him, but right now, the Jackets are not that.
Im cool with foudy otherwise I agree
Wow, Merzlikins has been terrible. What happened there?
Pretty sure that all stems from him being a perfect change of scenery candidate plus Johnny Hockey connection.  Honestly Hayes going to a quieter hockey market would probably give him a chance to breathe given what he's dealt with in the past few years.
I don’t think it sucks on Sevo.  It’s a good thing for us and him that the Devils will in short order have at least six more useful and cost-effective defensemen than him that he’d be redundant and he deserves more money than makes sense for NJ to pay a #7/#8.  It sucks when a player walks that we’d have rathered keep like Parise and Neidermayer.  It’s great when a player walks that wouldn’t have made a starting 20 here and would elsewhere.
He’s still an RFA so I’m not gonna say 100% but I could see them trading away his rights and going with Vanecek and Schmid.
I think it would be best for all parties if he went honestly. He could get a fresh start and hopefully get passed the injuries that have haunted him. Vanacek was a shockingly good add and Schmid seems like he has a solid future. We could afford to park an insurance goalie in Utica and develop what we have further, and with the cap magic that will be needed to hold this all together we need to shave every unnecessary penny.
But if his surgery was successful and he’s healthy to play we have to roster him. I doubt theres a trade market for him.
Not really, he just has an insanely elite shot and that’s it. He’d be a nice player for a team that needs a powerplay specialist but this year our team has had an influx of young talent that is good at scoring and also doing other things and his skill set doesn’t fit a bottom 6 role. Just kind of the odd man out.  He is kind of the guy that plays pickup basketball and only stands in one spot shooting 3s and nothing else. Eventually the other guys catch on.
Our fanbase has been really fucking stupid and needs a scapegoat that isn’t simply the boys just aren’t there yet.   Olofsson is a good scoring forward but we need room for guys like Kulich, Rousek and Savoie eventually.   Only so many roster sports and our defensive depth is ass.   Olofsson is kinda the odd man out who is a top 6 style forward with no room in our top 6 and we need a 2nd pair Dman something fierce.
Dude is do for atleast 2 shit penalties every game
Roslovic is a center that can play the PK and the PP (not fantastically, but he can), can put up about 40-50 points per season because he's ridiculously streaky. Closest comparable is the Christian Dvorak trade, so a low 1st and a 2nd, maybe a low 1st and a 3rd?
No clue. Apparently vancouver was really interested in him last offseason but we declined and wanted to keep him. Not sure what our ask was in that trade.   His value is probably around a second or third round pick is my best guess
I would think you would have to buy-out Peterson's contract. Doubt anyone would take home unless a 1st is attached and it really doesn't make sense for you to do that.   But I could be wrong, GMs do weird things.
I think that’s just wishful thinking haha. He has had his most amazing season this year but he still has many years of being a great player, with very good analytics. On top of his playoff experience, there will be lots of teams looking to sign him. No one’s backing off because of how good the avs are. It’ll take him accepting a discount to stay, which I hope happens.
See a team like Buffalo is a team I could see going after Compher. Not sure what your cap situation is like, but he’s a perfect piece for a team that’s looking to become serious playoff contenders. Not the shiny new toy, but brings value in so many other aspects. I really hope the Avs manage to keep him, if not Buffalo would be a sweet destination.
He’s a solid 4/5 guy. Severson on the second or third pairing will make most teams better. Severson’s biggest issue is he seemingly goes through random stretches where he just makes really costly errors in his own zone. He’ll try and get too creative with his passing and it leads to turnovers.
If Severson was in my top 4 as a contender I’d be worried. He’s a PP specialist. He’s never the option in the defensive zone, he’s the 5th option on the PK. He’s never the better player defensively on his pairing. He doesn’t face the opposition’s best players. The majority of his assists are secondary. He’s prone to careless unforced errors.
Wouldn't get injured as much if yall could just stop giving him golf carts
Yeah but hopefully some of the pain is offset by prospects taking steps forward.
Lmao honestly you’re probably not wrong. Dude just looks completely lost out there sometimes.
back to Boston, on a league minimum deal is what I’m guessing  RemindMe! 5 months
Maybe market value?   Maybe he's toxic?
Eh, I think they could bring him back. Though I’m wary of banking on him being healthy as he has been and not slowing as he is over 30 years old.
Possibly but the goaltender market this summer is pretty bad. Unless the new GM (just speaking it into existence now) can swing a trade.
Counter point-Fuck James Reimer
Fuck Aaron Dell
I was having a Good Friday
I think he's just gonna get bought out. No signing bonuses, 2 years left is kind of a classic exit ramp.
The cost to trade him last year was prohibitively high. Teams were allegedly asking for a first to take on his contract. It'd still be expensive to move, but a buyout makes a lot of sense.
Not to mention he scored a goalie goal. I wouldn't be surprised if he repeats that feat on the NHL level.
St.Louis fans 🤝 Wings fans 🤝 Isles fans
UFA, but yeah thats valid
Yeah one of the two is gone for sure, maybe both
He was pretty ok during the first half of the season, but it’s been rough in the new year. The Jets have been mostly bad as a team, so it’s not really fair to single him out I guess. They could use an upgrade here though.
“Only” an RFA isn’t much better if the Leafs don’t have the funds to match an offer. Is enough coming off the books after this season to make a realistic offer to Samsonov possible?
It’s shocking you think rfa means he for sure stays…
Agreed, not sure why but he just seems uninspired and a bit lazy.  Hoping we keep winning.
He'd be fine in the bottom 6.  But he's on PP2 which is mind boggling to me.   Put Dube on the PP, he's got wheels and he can shoot.  Ritchie is good for a penalty or two every game as well.  He's contributed a bit in his short time here, but I believe there's better players that aren't getting the opportunity he is.  Even Duehr hustles his ass off and is putting up points.  Try him on PP2.
That's former 40 goal scorer Cam Atkinson to you.
Knights had never given up 5 goals in a game till we got quick.. he managed to do it twice
I get that from the Rangers perspective but make me wonder where Kane will sign. Back in Chigaco?
I'm not so confident but I really hope so. I'm not ready to let go yet! And Bergeron is still playing at an elite level.
He will, regardless of we win or not. He’ll have a farewell tour season, even if he may not announce it that way.
Yeah, that's what I think too. Wouldn't blame him if he wanted to get the bag elsewhere either, he's a depth player who's only got so long in the league, but he might well want to stay.
I do hope that’s the case but the rest of the league has also seen how good he is and if he tests the market he’s going to get more to leave since the Bs couldn’t afford to keep him.
I hope we can win the Cup (obviously) so we can sell high on Ullmark and get a haul of prospects + picks from a contender. Would rather have Swayman if we can only choose one
I think Helm may be better at face offs.  But I would love to keep Nieto!
Isn't it supposed to be SJC's turn with Nieto?  E: SJC not JSC.
I honestly, and this isn't part of that hate bandwagon, think a Girard trade isn't a bad idea. Byram is probably going to ask for about that much in his contract and has looked amazing. If Manson and him stay healthy, that'll leave Girard on the third pairing. That's a nice 5m for a 3rd pair D. And he has definitely raise his stock while Makar has been out.   I think you move him for that 2C. If not, you have Landy. He's centered sometimes and they have good options like Nuke on that top line. Pair Compher and Lehky with Landy gives you a good supplemental scoring and a very high energy line. You also have Malgin showing up. Giving him a "try out' deal could also solve that second pairing as well.   I think letting him go would be a mistake. LOC has proven to be a good third liner and it's far easier to find bonafide bottom six players as opposed to played like Compher and Lehky that are easy to move around as you need them.   Newhook is looking a lot like Jost right now.
He had been away from the team to deal with a family matter. He has commented that he is not back into game shape yet, therefore not getting ice time.
Well Puljujarvi is an rfa and the canes gave up assets for him so will probably not let him walk for free.
Dude has Nichushkin syndrome when he was in Dallas. Good player but the puck just won't go in.
PING!
OK was great when healthy
damn thats crazy. does not feel like its been so long since he played. whats so wrong with his shoulder that he cant play anymore??? shoulder seems like one of the last injuries that should end a guys career in his 20s.
Would you rather keep yams or bjug though? Yams can probably get a 2nd or more depth. He is not a physical player and can’t capitalize on what he’s offered. I love how scrappy he is but he’s not worth 3.1.
It’s possible. Larsson is a little less likely but I’d like to think he’d be more happy with his best friend there.
Once a blue jacket, always a blue jacket.
They already gave his number away. Didn’t even raise it to the rafters yet.
I just don’t see where he fits in with everyone healthy + Texier + Voronkov
I think it sucks. Hes been here awhile and I’d love for him to be able to see it out but there isn’t room for him on the blue line in the future. If he would take a cheap 2 year deal that would be great as we bring guys up and we’d have the best 7 man in the league most likely, but someone is going to give him some dough and he deserves it. Maybe I’m just a softy but he’s played “miles” better than what we’ve seen the past few years. He deserves more credit than he gets, everyone on this blue line has made plays worthy of ripping our eyes out. We just love to point his mistakes out more, he will be a good addition to whatever team snags him
He could also be the most well paid AHL goalie of all time.  That’s being said, if he comes back as good as ever, then winning cures all crazy snake stories.
He could be an Arizona Coyotes legend in short order
So he’s younger Mike Hoffman?
Yes, more of this and less of the Patrick Kane b.s.
Sounds kind of like a discount Hronek
Well for any non devils fans who read this comment I have a different take for you. His biggest short comings come from puck battles in the corner and outlet passes from those kind of situations. That’s where I agree. He’s not that big and way the devils forwards aggressively break out at any chance presented has resulted in a lot of turnovers by all of our blue liners all season when we try and force it. Severson has a history of that and although he’s gotten better about it the fan base has a lot of disdain for him because of that and rightfully so. But he has not been the worst defender in his pairings whatsoever. When Marino got hurt this season he played his best hockey in years and was getting 20+ mins a game. Hes been on a third pairing and played with Smith who is probably the worst defensemen in the league, Ohykituk who was a work in progress, and Bahl who he was better than up until recently as Bahl’s game has gained confidence and grown all year. If he’s on your second pair with a great stay at home defenseman that’s a great combo. He’s dealt with inconsistency for his pairing all year and rose way above what was expected of him.  Also side note great defender off the rush. Solid poke check and tough to beat solely on speed and has good position when he’s defending someone one on one off said rush. He succeeds more when pace of play is high, but if we’re pinned in our own end more it’s gonna be tough for a Severson/Brendan Smith to get a good clear and thus mistakes get made. He’s better than our fans claim, but he’s worse probably than my sevo homer analysis
I pay so little attention to the Jets I'm just confused he's fallen off that much
maybe its maybeline
There’s this dude who goes by soup who’s a reallllll nice guy…
If he just wore the jersey…
Yeah, if he were bought out, the cap hit would be 2.67 next year and 1.17 the year after. Very manageable.
I love greiss
I mean... he was pretty shit for us(Preds) last year. Seemed like a decent dude but man, he just isn't clutch.
Murray gets moved, Kerfoot is coming off the books. That's $8.1 million right there.
It is a lot better for a couple reasons. First, it’s fairly rare for RFAs to not resign with their teams if a qualifying offer is made. Second is the draft pick compensation, I would imagine anything the Leafs aren’t willing to match would net them at least a second round pick if not a first and a third. So assuming the Leafs tender a qualifying offer (which they can absolutely afford to do) any team wanting to sign Samsonov would have to both be willing to pay an amount the Leafs aren’t able to match and be willing/able to give the Leafs the required draft picks as compensation.   So while Sammy’s future at the club is not 100% certain he is nowhere near 100% gone and him being an RFA makes it far more likely he resigns than goes elsewhere.
I didn't say he is "for sure" staying, I corrected someone who said he was going to enter unrestricted free agency. And this topic is someone asking about players who are "100% gone after this season", so a *restricted* free agent was not a good contribution. Any other trite nonsense you'd like to add or was that it?
I doubt this will happen because it seems Holland has been more focused on our defense, but I still think having Kane with McDavid and the other Kane would be a very fun line
I think he should retire or join a young team, somewhere warm. He can always get hip surgery, and ride the LTIR for Vegas until the playoffs.
Sabres imo.
I wonder if he'd go to Buffalo for cheap.  Young up and coming team from his home town.
Buffalo
Rumor is he will go back to Chicago to chase the all-time franchise records, I think if they get Bedard it's almost a sure thing.
Here's the Friedman podcast I always point to about Bergeron not retiring after this year.  > Friedman: ...do you see the end?  > Bergeron: (*chuckles*) Yeah eventually the end is closer than it's been right. I know that, I'm not foolish to think there's a lot ahead. But I'll try to enjoy the now.   > Friedman: Now will you make those decisions at the end of every season or will you ever go into a year and say "this is my last season"?  > Bergeron: That's a good question. I think it's going to come to me, you know, when I think it's the last one.  > Friedman: That hasn't happened yet, I assume?  > Bergeron: No (*chuckles*) I uhh I think once I know I'm going to express that. I think I owe that to everyone involved. And then you know, family friends, teammates, obviously, management. And you know, eventually media as well. but the timing's not quite there yet.  > [Starts at about the 19 minute mark.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqwBSdlSGHA)
Yea I mean he's not gonna be the Center per se, but does the same overall workhorse job really well. We'll just play someone else in the C as we've done all yr (since Helm has barely played).      I wouldn't mind keeping Helm though, if he was to get himself fit over the summer. The injury seems really troublesome, there doesn't seem to be a fix for it.
What is JSC? I am lost
I'm not in the bandwagon either, but ever since Byram arrived, I've been supportive of the idea of trading him as well, for the sake of the cap.      He's definitely improved his defensive game, and on his day it's actually a nightmare for even the best players in the game to play against Girard. On other days ofc, mistakes happen quite a lot.    We'll see what happens though. His deal is sort of good for some teams that aren't right on the edge of the cap, because there are many players his level, that are being paid 6-6.5M (Provorov, Faulk, Krug, Schmidt, Brodin etc) while he's 5M for long term so the contract is actually quite fucking nice. Just doesn't fit our plans imo 😂 because I'd rather have that money for the center indeed.
I think the market will be very soft for Girard.  The Avs may be able to move him, but they won’t get anything back (besides the cap space).
>That's a nice 5m for a 3rd pair D. And he has definitely raise his stock while Makar has been out.  I genuinely ask this because I haven't been as plugged in to other teams this year: What team moves a 2C for Girard? A 'solid top 4 D' isn't worth the same, particularly in this environment. I root for a team that has spent over 20 years looking for a number 1 center and what I've learned is any centers of notable value are very difficult to come by, where young top 4 D with upside are much more plentiful.
Fair i thought he was UFA for some reason.
I could see him come to the Avs next season on a small deal for that reason and to reunite with MacKinnon
Best day of my life.
We still miss him dearly
He had serious arthritis in his shoulder which explains why he stopped clapping bombs towards the end of his playing career. He talked about how much pain he would be in.  I also remember he also dealt with infection issues post surgery.   Just a lot of unlucky stuff that led to the decision to retire early to try to retain quality of life going forward.
It's not a this or that, the Oilers are going to have Yamamoto for another year. I can't see many teams taking him given his injury issues and size, his offensive numbers playing with the two best players in the world aren't great. So you're not off-loading him for a full year's worth of contract. It'd be nice to keep Bjugstad but all the Oilers insiders are saying it's unlikely he comes back because this will be his year for a final big cash in. And Edmonton doesn't have the space to pay him. If you could get rid of Yamamoto then maybe, but now you need to fill that top six player with someone else.
Probably ERob replacement/boost.
I feel the same way about wood personally. Watching the devs through the last few years there were many games we was the only one with any fight in him compared to the kids (he got an A on him at some point for this exact reason), and I’d like to see him get a ring with us because of it. Most likely he’ll be gone though, that injury of his really put a notch back on his speed which was his entire offensive game 🙁
Haha yeah. But that just fucks our cap as only 1 mil or something can be buried. And yep if he comes out as good as he was all aboard the lehner train.
Happened to Dallas with khudobin. I have no idea how they convinced Chicago to take him. Loved the guy, especially after that 2020 play off run; but the combination of injury and long Covid hit him hard.
I think Hoffman was a better overall player, Olofsson doesn’t have a fiancée that has harassed Dahlin and his girlfiend for all I know too
He had always been a fan favorite being the first Jets 2.0 draft pick.  Found great chemistry with Wheeler early on, interviewed well, seemed like a student of the game, had lots of us thrilled that he would be our next captain and hopefully next GM. Unfortunately the last four or so seasons have shined light on who he really is.  Plays minimal defense, stays out too long for shifts, gets whiny when things aren’t going well, has no fight in him, gets a bit dirty when he’s pissy, no real faceoff skill, and has done nothing to step up as a leader in the locker room during frustrating times.  In fact, many reports say he’s one of the biggest issues in the locker room.  His offensive output and playmaking ability make him an asset, but he has fallen from grace in the eyes of the fans. Six years of opportunity in front of arguably the best goalie in the world and all kinds of talent around him…he just seems uninterested. He’d be a massive addition to a contending team with a good locker room, but our whole squad is just broken and he won’t be loved here even though he’s putting up career highs in offense.
Who is going to take Matt “The Glassman” Murray?  He’s got the trade value of a torn up Tie Domi RC 😞  And if Kerfoot walks, who replaces him?
Kane will probably want way to much money, and any term in a deal will end badly.  Also their is no room for Kane on the PP, nuge is the prefect 3rd to 97 and 29
Maybe try defense and goal tending?
Fuck off no thanks. We don’t want him.
Sign in Ottawa. Play with giroux like he should’ve.
Do you like him for Anaheim? They are the team I thought of first that has young guys and great location. Truly dont know your guys cap sitch tho.
Keep him as far away from this team as you can. We don't need him and don't want him.
I like that! Seems like a solid idea
I cannot stress how badly I dont want Chicago to get Bedard, sorry lol.
Yeah, obviously depending on what happens in the playoffs and the off-season, he could reach that point, but like I said, I'm not ready for that. Never will be ready though haha.
I do love Helm and love when he plays for us! Maybe we keep Eller as the center for that line.
That should have been SJC. I was just tired and didn't see the typo.
Not just that but he's still only 24. I'd love to keep him, it's just the cap space. You'd need a very cheap defenseman or cut costs a lot of places to keep a 3rd pairing D at 5m.
I don't know about that. It's definitely a possibility. He is a top four defenseman that is on a good deal and is young. He was supposed to be our top 4 guy but this guy name Bowen Byram got drafted. It makes him kind of expendable.   I think the only real reason not to is Byram's injury history. Keeping Girard would make sort of sense in that aspect.
There are a lot of young top 4D. But which ones are available?  That's the difference. Avs have one in their back pocket.
I don't. Think the problem with it is you have too many potential second line players. Compher, Lehky, Newhook, Malgin and Rodriguez. Have to kind of figure out who goes and who stays. Lehky is a lock but Malgin has shown a lot of promises. Then with Landy coming back, it's a very hard top six to crack.
KlefbomisMyMom
I'd keep Yammo if his price drops. I'd love him around $2M. Would be a fair price imo
You’re actually probably right. Personally, I’d offload him for a second. But finding someone who will give us a second is probably not realistic. I do think you’re right about bjuggy, but I’d love to keep him. He actually wants to be here, and he’s been great. He’s not given the same opportunities as someone like yams but he’s been good here.
Damn, that’s saying something lol
Dubas was able to move Mrazek and he was a worse player with a relatively similar health history.
I assume the answer to question one is Arizona.
Kerfoot isn't getting paid close to what he makes now
Yeah, that’s also why it won’t happen. Still fun to imagine, like Erik Karlsson
I don't have any idea what Kane will do. I can't see him wanting to go to a shit team for top dollar at this point. He'll be 35 next season so I don't see any team giving him a top salary with term that has any chance of being good.
I think we can all agree that Kane is more valuable to his team than Kane when the post season starts.
Maybe try paying attention to the league’s current events?
We can sign McDavid and Matthew’s and be fine with the cap, and maybe on a one year sign and possibly trade. We really won’t be good enough to push for the playoffs next year.
Not sure why you were downvoted. You’re right, no way Adams signs him
Could be Columbus, that'd be worse for literally EVERYONE.
Yams has definitely been given more than enough opportunities to succeed. To me, the fact that he's not showing up to camp like Marty St Louis is a bit of a problem.. because he is far too easy to out muscle and it shows. I don't particularly value Bjugstad like you do, but it really does all depend on what his number is and what he's able to do in the playoffs.
Arizona has turned to not taking on salary - it really crashed the market for Chychrun. Anaheim, Chicago, Columbus, Montreal would all be far more likely destinations than Arizona.
Maybe fun but would not make the team any better. Kenny has the right idea look at what Ekholm has done for this team.
Honestly you never know what a hockey GM will do they make some really bad decisions sometimes.  I could see him chasing a cup but seems like city still matters the most to him.
Oilers have the second most goals against of any team with a playoff spot. I’m a fan, just preaching the truth.
Maybe if you get Bedard you will lol
I don’t even really value bjug, but I do know he adds value to the bottom 6. He kills penalties, and he’s happy to be here. He scores goals too. I don’t think he’s worth 3.1, I think he’s a 2x3 to 2x4 with a bit of +\- on the contract. If he signs for around that I would rather have that than yams or a comparable at 3+ per year.
They’re 10th in GA since the new year started. If you can’t see a difference from the team we saw at the beginning of the season, to the team we have now, then I very much doubt you’re an actual fan.
Honestly, no. Our defense is so bad this year that our goal differential is -142. That can’t be made up by one or two players.
Hahaha. I also noticed the three players with 100+ points. I’ll go with a change of guard in the d-core over an aging sniper with a bad hip, any day.
Daily reminder that he lost the Hobey Baker to a goalie last year after winning best goalie.  Also the first ever two time winner but it only started in 2014.
Incredibly well deserved. Best player in program history and arguably the best goaltender in NCAA history.  Also worth noting, Northeastern is the only school to have won the Richter multiple times. This is their third time winning the award (Primeau, Levi x2)
🤞
  No surprise. Shoulda won the Hobey too. He was without a doubt the most impactful player in College hockey.
It might be decades before I get over that shit.
Meanwhile Dryden McKay (Hobey Baker winner) .901 sv% in the ECHL
I don’t follow college hockey outside of my big 10 team. How did Northeastern not win it all with Levi in net? Rest of the team not very good?
Now if only the Huskies could actually win a national championship :(
Yeah instead of cheering for the guy who came in second and is having tons of success, let's shit on a guy who hasn't been mentioned in a year.
The team was good, but not great. Plus Hockey East is stacked with great teams. But they won the Beanpot this year with Levi, it was an insane tourney, so at least they have Boston bragging rights for another year
Both of the past two years we got eliminated because we couldn’t score enough. Levi did what he could but we just couldn’t score more than one goal.
Not trying to shit on him. Just comparing the guy who won and the guy who didn't 1 year later
What about if they beat the Capitals?
Tied with the Coyotes, Blackhawks, and Predators…. Makes sense.
[This is a little easier to see their H2H records](https://www.hockey-reference.com/teams/BOS/2023_headtohead.html)
The Capitols? The band that did the classic song Cool Jerk?
Then the capitals lost
Damn Jordie Benn looks like he’s having a tough season
Pssshh....no goalies?  Cowards.
I'm so used to visors (and cages to an extent) now that it actually looks wrong without them.
I remember when it was, "remaining players that don't have to wear helmets." And it was surprisingly not that long ago.
Ryan O'Reilly  Milan lucic  Jordie benn  (Arizona coyote player)  (Tampa Bay player)  Matt Martin  Ryan Reaves  Jamie benn  Help me out here  Edit: Zach Bogosian. One more.  Edit: fuckin kassian. Should have known that one..
AKA “the fuck around and find out” guys. Love these guys.
Is there a correlation between not having a visor and having a beard? Maybe the visor gets in the way of their beard
Plug plug goon plug goon goon plug   STANLEY CUP CHAMPION RYAN O’REILLY
Why did you edit this so that Reaves is looking into my soul??
I will never understand no visor, they look cool, just look at Kopitar.
I’m sure it’s easy to sit here and say what I’d do if I were in the league, but I just wouldn’t see myself playing without a cage (even though I’m a goalie) I enjoy my teeth and face alignment
Safety aside… visors look cooler.
Are visors required for players now?
I feel old and remember when this meme would be about the remaining helmet-less…
need a Benn-ROR-Tavares line
GET MY CAPTAIN OUT OF THAT JERSEY. Pain 🥲
Average IQ of a baguette in this photo.
I didn't know Non was in the NHL.  I guess he needed a new job after Zod.
Christ, I'm old enough to remember the players who didn't wear *helmets*. I never thought I'd see the visors (which hadn't made a lot of inroads at the same time) as prevalent as they are now.
If a player that came in before the change decided to take his visor off would it be allowed?
Does this mean we have grit?
Studs.
Plugs. All plugs. Lol
I feel like it would be so weird to play hockey without a visor becuase like you can feel your helmet on your head but like there’s nothing in front of your face lol.
No visor and Reaves is ready to throw down anytime.
Jesus, Jordie Benn lookin like Non from superman
Why did you photoshop Gimley into the top right?
That leaf in the upper right was one of a trio that got beat up by Superman at his ice palace.
Isles wear the 50 patch
Is it just me or does Reaves look a lot like a black version of Auston Matthews?
The nose knows.
I remember the last helmetless player.
Warriors
I thought someone photoshopped Ryan Reeves smoking for a second there lol
Double Bennetration in this photo
4 of those guys have played or are playing for the leafs the past little while
Did Gudbranson start wearing a visor at some point?
Why do they go visor less? Isn’t it just more dangerous and visors look cool
Bogo and Benn are savage. Not wearing a visor as a dman is nuts.
That was the photo they used when they announced he was on waivers lol
Looking like Kratos on skates
Looks like Non from Superman
Yeah like the helmet looks wrong somehow
Reaves is the only one that doesnt look weird without a visor for me
I remember when it was just Craig MacTavish left helmetless. He even went to an All-Star game because he was the last one, and on the verge of retirement.
I believe that was Craig McTavish in 94. I hate to break it to you but that was 29 years ago.
Wait until cages become the norm and the last visor player will retire.
Exactly what I was thinking lol. For some reason, Randy Carlyle comes to mind. Haha
You got caught up by the Zach/k's
played the same game, had to look at the comments for Ryan Reaves, totally blanked on the big mans name. Shame, shame, shame.
Kassian you fool.
It does seem like they're mostly all bulkier players as well, if we're making connections.
Martin probably only doesn’t have one bc of Lou’s rules
More along the lines of "things that make you look like a tough mofo"
No idea how a visor would get in the way of a beard at all, visor wouldn’t even come close to touching to beard + Burns has a visor
I will not hear the Zach Bogosian slander, if cups are the measurement he’s just as good as ROR
Hey now let’s not forget ART ROSS WINNER JAMIE BENN
Milan Lucic is a Stanley cup winner and a 30 goal scorer in 2011
Jamie benn is the best player in the image
:(
I kinda wanna kiss him?
Yeah I've always felt this was the one time a safety thing acctually looks cooler.
Disagree but okay. Visors look extra dumb when the players push them up anyway..
Hard disagree on that one
Like the visor from Cyclops
I think they were mandated beginning in 2013, which is why these guys were all drafted in 2012 or earlier.
Since only a handful of players are without, yes. Have been for a little while hah
A lot of players didn't wear one before the mandate. But any player with IIRC more than 25 NHL games played could choose to continue without one and be grandfathered in or put the visor on. A good amount chose to put the visor on. The rest have been slowly dwindling down. Chara and Getzlaf are two that come to mind that retired recently.
Not sure Jordie would keep up with them but ok
Sorry honey. We will take good care of him!
No
4/8 have played for us, 2 currently. Which is probably the highest in the league. So I’d say yes haha.
I'll have you know Matt Martin is having a career-high year in points
Yes Ryan O’Reilly noted 4th line plug
Ahhh I think Jamie Benn and O'Reilly might disagree there.
Milan used to be good at hockey a decade ago
Terrible take.
One word, are you ready for it?  Bennaissance  Now more words. Try to keep up  I can't help it that you are factually incorrect
Went from full cage to no visor and it was one of the best things ever. Like taking socks off that you've worn for too long or what I imagine the ladies feel when they get the boulder holder off for the day
Austin Matthews looks like an egg-headed pedo
What he was on waivers? That's wild
Yah so I guess he doesn't count since he's not in the NHL anymore.
It looks like a regular helmet that hit a rough spot and decided to cut bangs but took off an inch too much
It looks too small
I think its because helmets are taller now somehow. They all look like they're a few sizes too small and just sitting on top of dudes heads instead over them
It’s wild that they ever thought not wearing a helmet was a good idea. Like accidents happen ?? I don’t get the visor thing tho, is it a concussion thing? Cuz if players want to break their nose or lose an eye that’s on them and seems reasonable enough if a player doesn’t mind and helps their vision. Much different than cracking your head on the ice. It always seemed a play to soft ban fighting. For the record I’m all for player safety when it comes to reducing concussions but fighting for me is just to integral to the sport. I’m probably just old tho and can’t see the right perspective. I like the meta, if the league was made up of only zegras and Hughes players it wouldn’t be very entertaining to me
Mactavish didnt wear a helmet up until 97, I'm pretty sure.
Right. They said not that long ago.
Sure, but for something like that without knowing the actual stat id bet most people would think is happened sometime in the 60's or 70's.
That’s more time than the average reddit user has been alive, so yeah I think that’s a long time ago.
Fuuuuck that
THICC
Lou transformed Martin from Dollar Tree Brad Pitt to Cleaner Cut Brad Pitt
I don’t think I’ve ever seen him with a bear even during playoff runs so might be he can’t grow one
I don’t remember him having a beard on the leafs
Are you even looking at the picture? The evidence is overwhelming
ThatsTheJoke.Zap.Branigan.simpsons.png
Also here for Bogy. This shall not stand.
CONNE SMYTHE WINNER ZACH BOGOSI- wait
Aka plug #4
Well known neck-crosschecker Jame Benn
*at one point in time
Facts. My captain.
He prefers giving fist kisses.
Same lmao
I'm a Rangers fan, me too. Miss you Reavo ❤️
[😅](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FqFvsCYXoAAblQv?format=jpg&name=900x900)
My beer league cracked down on this last year and it was hilarious watching dudes who wear the thing on the crown of the heads argue with refs for putting them in the box repeatedly sometimes because they refuse to adapt.  They all have that douche mentality too that it affects their, already often shit game, and “the only person who has to be afraid of being hurt is me!  Why do you care!!”  I care because the rink and ‘league’ care and they make the rules jack ass.  A dude lost his eye at a tournament a couple years ago and that was the end of the line for forehead visors.  My favorite part of the rule is that if you get called for it more than 5 times in a season you not allowed to play unless you wear the full cage.  A couple dudes got forced into it and it was hilarious because it was the worst offenders.  It’s amazing what entitled assholes some people are
I'm actually surprised to see the opinion that visors look cooler. I don't know a single person irl that thinks no visor doesn't look dope. I think NO HELMET looks even cooler, but I know that's insane.
Thornton too
Please 😢
thats actually interesting
I'm not gay but there is something sexy about Matt Martin
He likes plugging holes in the sides of Tim Horton's.
It’s Auston and he is beautiful
The Leafs, not the Wild
Jordie, not Jamie
I had to look it up but you're certainly correct. Still a bit longer than, "not too long ago" in my opinion.
Why? Men's professional hockey is the only high level hockey that doesn't wear cages. It's already the anomaly, not the norm.  Also, I'm sure that's what people were saying about helmets in general in the 60s and 70s, yet here we are today.
Nope, Boomer Esiasons daughter is responsible for that transformation.
Haven't seen him without a beard either...
He was a leaf when Lou was at the helm tho iirc
He's number one in my plug heart
He's still a point per game player
You obviously get all of your hockey opinions from the internet. He is a point-per-game player and captain of a 100-point team
[well established in larkin’s book too](https://youtu.be/pUQAia3Sx_4)
Ahhh the old “I’m not gay but”  Classic
Let's put it this way..McDavid was BORN in 97.   I agree. It's a bit longer than "not that long ago."
Ah yes, the one case. I know of at least 2 in Benn's case, and one resulted in a broken neck  To be clear: that was a bad play by Larkin, not defending it. But one of the two has a pattern of behavior
The passage of time is relative. To someone McDavid's age, it was forever ago. To someone following hockey for 50 years or something, it wasn't that long ago.
i’ll defend it. was gonna be a cross check to the midsection, oshie raised his arms and stick while larkin was doing it and larkins stick rode up off of oshie into his head. was a split second accident.
Even if you've been following hockey since 1968, 1997 was a long time ago.  25+ years isn't "just the other day" to very many people. Even for someone who lives to 100, that's a full quarter of their life.
I definitely put that one in the freak accident bin.
I sure miss the Nordiques. That rivalry was epic!  On another note RIP plain white ad-free boards.
The nastiest brawl of all time. Yes, nastier than the Throwdown In Hockeytown. The Battle of Quèbec was so much more personal. It divided families. You'd have a Habs supporting father and his Nordiques supporting son, and the two wouldn't talk to each other.
THAT was a fun rivalry!
Tyler Toffoli has 34 goals so far, and over 70 points. He's been our best offensive player and it's not close
Owen Power. He’s not flashy but he’s like the ultimate hockey robot. He does so many little things that add up that he won’t get much credit for outside of advanced stats systems. His offensive impacts are already elite and once he grows into playing defense he’s going to be a two way force.  Also, weirdly, Dylan Cozens. First 30 goal season by a Sabre 21 or younger in 30 years and he’s behind only Jack Hughes in scoring by his draft class this year. If he was on our team doing this 5 years ago everyone would prop him up as our savior but now he’s just another solid young guy.
Verhaeghe is the first panther not named Bure to reach the 40 goal mark and doesn't get talked about much outside of threads directly mentioning about him. Luostarinen also has single handedly made the Trochek trade actually worth it for the panthers, he's become such a great 2 way play driver who can play on both the wing and at Center
Chatfield has been absolutely fantastic. 14 points from a third pair defenseman that, prior to this season, most people expected to be a career AHLer is really remarkable. He's also a +22, as terrible as that stat is.  Skjei might also qualify for this? I feel like the fact that he still has a chance to score 20 goals this season is kinda going under the radar. The only defensemen with more than him are Karlsson and Hamilton.
Montembeault has been solid for us despite everything. Looking at his stats they won't stand out but he's played well and would produce better numbers with a healthy team on the ice.   Interested to see what happens next season with the Habs goaltending but cheering on Monty regardless of the jersey.  For the Flames I would say Backlund. He is having a career year points wise, sneaky good and plays a great 200ft game. Reminds me a lot of Lehkonen when he was with the Habs and didn't get much recognition outside of the Canadiens fanbase then got more exposure with the Avs. I hope Backy is a Flame forever.
Dougie Hamilton quietly has 73 points. His previous career high was 50. He has a chance to break the Devils defenseman points record and barely anyone is talking about him
Noah Cates.
Nic Dowd.  Dude is indispensable on that 4th line.  Been underrated for the better part of his career as a Cap.
Joel Eriksson Ek.  Nearly a point per game with elite defense. As a plus he broke his own NHL record of 10,000 cross checks received. So bummed he got injured...😭
Somehow, Quinn Hughes. I know most people's assessment of players not on their team/in their division usually lags by about two seasons, and he's further hindered by being on a West Coast team, but it's still criminal.
Nugent Hopkins is having the quietest 100-point season I have ever seen. Minimal media attention, despite he is surpassing so many perennial superstars.
Seth Jones has consistently put up elite underlying numbers since arriving in Chicago last year and has had great production to back it up. This year has been more of the same despite our roster being demolished and the team just in general being designed to fail.  He’s a bonafide top pairing player that can handle a fuck load of minutes but is usually treated like a mediocre second pairing guy by most on this sub. I don’t think he gets nearly enough credit for all he does.  The trade was still horrific for where the Hawks were headed and his contract sucks because of the term, but Jones is a very, very good player lol
I feel like we’ve been so good this year that no one is really going under the radar, but I still think what Zacha has been doing this year has been underrated. He’s done everything that’s been asked of him and more. His usual spot is on a line with Krejci and Pasta and his main role is to do the dirty work and be a more defensive presence so that those two can do their thing, and he’s been great. Then in games where we have some injuries and we need someone to step up he’s been really good at taking over the 2C role, really been cementing himself as a legit Krejci replacement for after this season. Just been an ultimate Swiss Army knife for Monty and has played on all three top 9 lines this season doing different roles, and all with success.  Just to add a little context to just how much Monty trusts Zacha, last night he was filling in Krecji at 2C against the Leafs and the most common line that he matched the second line up against at 5v5 was the Matthews line. And that's with Bertuzzi and Pasta as his wings, who are both somewhere around average at defense. Monty really, really trusts him in every facet of the game and he's been rewarding that trust all year long.
I think Barabanov would be a solid middle 6 player on a contending team. He's skilled, good on entries, and is tenacious along the boards. He's taken a solid step up from last year.  Also Lorentz and Sturm have had solid bottom 6er seasons.
Old man Giroux.   He's probably been our best and most consistent player all season long. I expected 20g 30a type production from him, but he's pretty much PPG and the only forward who plays with any composure.  Literally the perfect vet presence, and the ebst we've had since Alfie
Robo has been getting all the attention, but Hintz has been a ppg player while being their best two way forward. Had injuries not hampered him this year he would be gunning for 40 goals
horrifying thought, but MEV has been significantly less of a pylon this year than the past 3
Dakota Joshua
Barrett Hayton is producing at a 65 point pace on the top line with 37 points in 46 games, he looks to solidly be a top 6 center now which greatly helps the rebuild.   Lawson Crouse has 23 goals and 21 assists, really strong production from a power forward, especially after a lot of people said we overpaid him last offseason.   Juuso Valimaki has 19 points in 27 games as the 1D, replaced Chychrun’s production very well and is posting good defensive numbers.
Konecny's incredible season seemed to be flying under the radar before slowing down a bit and getting hurt  Has 29 goals 56 points in 56 games.  Great for anybody but to do it on this team w/ bottom 3 PP and so little talent where he has to create almost everything is incredible.  Next best scorer on team is Hayes with 54 pts in 77 games ...  As of 2 days ago Konecny was leading NHL in % of points he has point on when team scores when hes on the ice (80%).  When hes on the ice hes creating everything for us.  Flyers have had some key young breakout years too with Cam York, Owen Tippett and Morgan Frost  All good top 6/4 players this year which is huge for the Flyers.  York has been best Flyers dman and only dman w/ good all around analytics, Tippett has 23 goals which is 2nd on team and  Frost has been a stud for a few months now.  **Frost has 33 even strength points over last 50 games which is top 30 in NHL over that span.**  Seems like hes finally living up to his junior hype and will be a key top 6 center in Philly for awhile.  Also Noah Cates is having a Selke level season by the metrics as a rookie winger moved to Center which is incredible.  He'll be a really good middle 6 C for a very long time.
Matheson was supposed to be a cap dump return to move Petry but he's been having an amazing year for the habs
Well the Jackets suck *really* badly this year, but i’d say a pleasant surprise this season has been Chinakhov. His two way game has really improved this season (and then he got injured).
Nick Jensen has been outstanding for Washington
Under rated league wide: Rasmus Andersson. Guy is 18th in points league wide amongst defenseman on a Calgary team that’s not known for its offense and has an abysmal powerplay, is a rock defensively, eats 24:00 minutes a night and plays plenty on the PP and PK.   Severely under rated by Calgary fans as well as league wide: Noah Hanifin. Guy was 20th amongst defenseman in even strength scoring last year and is 26th this year (lead our team both years), yet time and time again you hear him described as a “average middle pair guy”.
Darnell Nurse, especially down the stretch. Will never get the respect he deserves because of his contract and the other headliners on the Oilers, especially with the historic offensive season they’re having, but ever since Ekholm got here and he’s not the only Top 4 capable LD on the Oilers and doesn’t have to play the single hardest minutes of any player in the league anymore he’s shown why the Oilers would rather overpay him than let him walk and try and find a replacement. Legit extremely solid top pairing defenceman.
Hard for the Leafs as they get talked about a lot by Leafs fans, media, and the fans of every other team as well, but probably Giordano.  Dude is 39, has 24 points and has been one of the most consistent Dmen on the team all year. I don't recall a game where he has been a liability and he blocks shots like a mad man but I can't recall a time where a shot went off him and in the net.
Dougie Hamilton. He’s 3rd in D scoring and 2nd in goals. Ahead of the big name guys that are getting a ton of attention. He’s doing exactly what we signed him to do.
Uh....
Novak, got called up on 19 Dec after Tolvy was claimed & has proceeded to put up 41 points in 47 games
I'll go with Michael Rasmussen.   He has been improving slowly year over year and this season is the first time where we saw him really take over shifts. He has finally learned to use his size and raw power to impose his will in board battles and drive the net consistently. He was scoring at a good pace and him getting injured was the final nail in the wings season. They really don't have anybody else at forward with that kind of play style.   This was the first season where I found myself thinking not "who are they going to put with Rasmussen?" but " who gets to play with Rasmussen?"  Now that he's been able to win battles and hold the puck more we're also seeing a lot more of the skill that made him a top 10 pick. He's shown some nice hands in tight for a 6"6' man and had some beautiful individual-effort goals as well.
For the Avs, it's been a rocky year with injuries but I'd say Lehkonen or JT Compher would be my nominations.  Lehky is crushing his previous career point totals, and has been reliable in the top-6 all year. We knew his all-around play would be great, but he's definitely contributing more offensively than expected.  Compher has been a bit of a whipping boy in the past, and the Avs fanbase was predicting doom-and-gloom if we ended up with JTC as our 2C. That may still come to pass in the playoffs since he's still at best a low-end 2C, but he's generally held up "ok" during the regular season and I think it's fair to say this is the best edition of JTC that we've seen.
Trent Frederic. I've been so impressed with him this year. He has 16 goals (his previous high was 8) and 30 points (previous high was 18) and you can tell he is playing with so much more confidence this year. He could be an important piece going forward if he keeps his current development pace and becomes a 20 goal scoring 3rd liner
It's the same every year but defenseman matt Roy, sattled with an atrocious off-side Durzi he had been pretty good. As soon as he got a competent partner in Gavrikov that line became almost elite and stopping attacks and driving play. Now he's back with Durzi and he's just getting let down over and over
Jake sanderson has been incredible as a rookie for us. Our best defenseman this season.
Strome.  He's actually had the best season of his career with us, but because we sucked this year, and we have the Ovi chase, it's mostly flown under the radar.
Chris Kreider may not be putting up a 50 goal season like last year but he's still having his second best career offensive year. 35 goals and 53 points, which if you take out last year is his highest career goal total and tied for his highest point total, which he'll probably surpass.   If these were his totals last year people would be saying he finally broke out, but because it's following the season it is the response has been mostly neutral.
Dylan Cozens -  76GP - 31G - 35A - 66P  22 year old playing 2nd line center with two rookies.
Freddie Gaudreau plays a very solid all around game, and wins shootouts like he’s been doing it his whole life.
Matt Benning being a great shutdown middle pairing guy while having his most productive season (24 points so far). Also signed at 1.25 mil for another three years after this
Trent Frederic is having an uprising this year and yet outside of the Bruins fanbase I don't hear anyone talking about him. He doesn't have a crazy amount of points (16 g 14 a) but compared to his previous years it's a pretty good sign for the future considering he's young.
I’m really enjoying Derek Ryan’s play this season.
Rangers fan here. Jimmy Vesey! He’s played on every line, I think he’s been on a line with any forward that has been on our roster this year too. Dude has *mostly*, silently been an absolute rock for us
Charlie Coyle kills penalties and has 43 points with basically no power play time
Kirill Marchenko. He's at the top of the rookie goal leaders and he's played about 20 games less.
Couture or Barabanov.  Coutch - 78GP - 27G - 39A - 66 PTS & Top 10 in Take-Aways  Barabnov - 68GP - 13G - 32A - 47 PTS On pace for 57 over 82 and really solidified himself as a Top 6 Winger  HM:   \- If Jacob Peterson played w/ Us the entire year then he'd be here (6 PTS in 7 GP)  \- Sturm has 15 Goals ish and made himself worth the 3rd Line C spot  \- Matt Benning has been great (Same with Pickles)
Now that he’s at 100 points people are recognizing him but Nuge has always been underrated.
Definitely got to be Miro Heiskanen, he’s quietly putting up a Norris-caliber season and I feel like no one is talking about him across the league
Järnkrok has like 40 points. That's amazing for 2M.
Ryan Nugent Hopkins. ain’t winning any awards this year, but he just notched 100 points.  One team guy, all situations, just took a paycut and signed a long term deal. He absolutely paid us back in spades this year.
Rasmussen would’ve been here guy went from a fringe nhler to being on pace for 45 points.
Probably Frank Vatrano, he's not setting the world on fire or anything but 20 goals and a career-high in points on arguably the worst team in the league is pretty neat, definitely the best off-season acquisition the Ducks made.
Andrew Copp
Quinn Hughes.   66a, 73pts, averaging 25 minutes a night, tied for 1st in +/- on the Canucks with +15, tied for 2rd in points for all defencemen.   And not even being mentioned for the Norris.
Tyler Toffoli
Lol 😂
There was some talk about Kempe regressing from last season's 35 goal career high.  One talking point was that he had something like 9 empty net goals.  He has passed that total with 36 goals and 60 points (both career high), and I think he has like 2 empty net goals or something.  Had a 4 goal night earlier this year too!
Erickson Ek.
Jason Zucker is on the verge of a 30 goal season after missing HUGE amounts of time each of the last three years. He seemed primed to decline now that he's over 30 but I think he's been one of our most consistent players this year.
Dakota Joshua has been a solid bottom six contributor for the Canucks
Ristolainen.    Stopped chasing hits.  Getting 20 mins a night, pk and pp.  I'm not saying he's a great top four option yet, but he's not at all a trash defenseman, and the analytics support the eye test.    He's become, dare I say, reliable?
Jarnkrok is having a career year for points and goals. Hes been a wonderful addition and a great add to the top 6 akin to how Bunting was, though not quite the same quality of player
Calle Jarnkrok
Nuge until 2 days ago. Now it's Kostin. I think he'll be the second coming of Fernando Pisani.
Nick Foligno, his absence over these past few weeks really shows. He was definitely an anchor for our bottom 6 and I think he was Bergys right-hand man for the leadership on the team. All the Behind the B episodes from the first few months of the season really show how well Nick was helping lead and inspire the team.
Jake walman
Olli Maatta
Brady Skjei
Barzal was having himself a nice season pre injury   But for a second year in a row, I'll say Zach Parise. He is like an engine that never dies, he brings so much energy every single shift and is just pure hustle. For what we pay him, he's got to be a top 10 contract in the league for value per dollar.
Not a TB fan but a guy I like Brandon Hagel   28G 33A
Barrett Hayton has 42 points in 79 games this season. That doesn’t seem that impressive on the surface but through his first 20 games this season he only had 3 points. In the next 15 he had 6 points. In the 44 games this calendar year he has 33 points. Since securing the position Centering Keller and Schmaltz his offensive production has skyrocketed and that has turned into one of the most highly productive lines in the NHL.   Other players of note that aren’t brought up as often are JJ Moser who leads the team in Ice Time this season and has 29 points. He’s a 2nd year defenseman who was drafted as an overager in the 2nd round of the draft 2 years ago. Valimaki was claimed off of waivers prior to the start of the season and has 33 points in 75 games.   Mattias Maccelli should be a finalist for the Calder Trophy and has one of the most unique stat lines I’ve ever seen from a forward. He’s currently averaging 1.26 shots per point. He’s taken less than 1 shot per game this season but still has 46 points in 61 games so far. Of forwards in the NHL this season to have played in at least 60 games only 6 have less shots than him. None of them average more than 13 minutes of time on ice per game. Macceli averages 15:35. He is the most extreme example of a pass first player I have ever seen.
JT MILLER
Braden Schneider has been a steady 3rd pair defenseman, playing a solid physical game, while having only 3 minor penalties this season (plus two fights).
JT Miller. For how much the media loved shitting on him for bad body language and for smacking the crossbar to get Colin Delia to head to the bench, you’d think he’d fallen off a cliff. Turns out he’s still a point per game player, great in the faceoff dot, has been an excellent two way player and is driving the second line since Rick Tocchet got here.   People have been saying you’d need to pay to get rid of his contract and that’s absolutely ridiculous, he’s still amazing
Brandon Hagel making 1.5 mil with 61 points in 78 games.
Filip Gustavsson becoming a legit starter after being traded for Cam Talbot in a 1 for 1 goalie swap.   Nobody is talking about that trade and how bad Ottawa fumbled
Michael McLeod. Very responsible in his own end, plays with an edge, and is 2nd in the league in faceoff %.
He’s not on my team so I don’t know how under the radar he really has been (a Sabres fan is welcome to inform me) but Alex Tuch was my favorite player during his time on the Knights. just out of curiosity out of seeing yet another highlight play he was involved in, I was blown away to see he had 35 fucking goals and 73 god damn points. Just. Holy shit.
Akira Schmid.
A couple Wings fans have mentioned Rasmussen, and I agree with them. He's picked up his game year over year immensely  That said, my pick is Larkin. That probably sounds like a weird pick seeing as he's our best player. But he's over ppg, plays all situations, plays a 2 way game, and is generally a solid leader. But people still shout and scream about "oh he shouldn't be captain, oh he's a 2C at best, oh he's overpaid"  So he's still my pick
Cam York has arguably been the Flyers’ best defensemen this season.
Dakota Joshua just cemented himself as an NHLer and could be the next Ryan Reeves. Theres room to grow dispite his age, and I think the fact that he has a great mind for hockey (but not depth of skill like top 6 players would have) will allow him to be in the league for the next 4-8 years.
The team is a tire fire but Kirill Marchenko is almost one off the rookie leaders in goals with 20 less games than the leader
Brandon Montour, apparently. Tied for 4th in points for defencemen but that post early today left him off the list of who to vote for the Norris while including the other 8 in the top 9.  Not to mention he is weighed down by a subpar dman in his pairing. Him stepping up has been huge while Ekblad has had an injured and off season again.
Tommy Novak, he’s been amazing this year and Evangelista, since his call up has 13 points in 20 games. Parssinen has 23 points in 42 games, lots of upside for our young crop coming up
Kappo Kakko is a nightmare to back check against, but while the “kid line” has gotten a fair bit of praise, you usually hear about Chytil since his playoff breakout and Lafreniere (for better or worse).
Dakota Joshua came out of nowhere to be the energy guy we needed. 10 G/10A season and hits everything.
Calle Jarnkrok 19G 37pts. Nothing crazy but he’s been a great contributor.
Sammy has been underrated this year imo. Guy has been a top 10-15 goaltender for most of the year coming in as the assumed 1B and a reclamation project. He's been really solid all year and I feel super comfortable when he's in net. I think people sleep on his play because rebound control at times is not the best but in his 'show me' year he has been better than expected.
Larkin is by the far the best in DET, underrated probably Walman or Chiasson.
Tomas Tatar
Auston Matthews
Kucherov.  Look, I'm not saying people don't think he's good. They do. He's certainly not underrated as a player... But in a season where everyone is talking about Makar, Ovechkin, McDavid, McKinnon,  I feel like his 100pt season has gone largely unnoticed. Even in every piece of media his presence has been diminished.
Justin Faulk, the man's got moves. I wish he would shoot more. I guess he was to busy trying to be the only defender this year
Can anyone really be underrated on the Leafs? 😅
I’ve seen some good Devils suggestions but let me add one more. Tomas Tatar. He got dragged a lot last year, but he has been incredibly solid this year. He has spent time on pretty much every line and was a big part of our first line humming at one point. He’s someone I want sticking around in New Jersey.
Connor McDavid, compare the hype Matthews got last year to 97 this year. Or how he is having a top season of, all, time.  Should be talked about every damn day.
Savageclap lately has been pretty dominant
Owen Power
Erik Karlsson.   Obviously not an under the radar player, but the Sharks are so bad this season that it makes what he's doing that much more impressive and that much less noticed. His contract sort of counterbalances how he's rated as a player too, which is fair but weird since it doesn't change the fact that he's putting up ridiculous numbers.   Either way I don't think people are as blown away by what he's doing as they have when he's done it other years and people have lost their minds over it, so I'm calling that underrated.   Then again I haven't watched as much hockey this year as some others so maybe he's getting more attention than I've noticed.
If we’re talking underrated I will always say Barkov…… but Lomberg is a freakin stud. If we had a team full of Lombergs we might never lose a game.
Dylan Larkin is not underrated u/AmeriCanadian98
Isaak Phillips. Dude's a legit NHL quality defenseman.
Marchenko, new rookie record for goals for CBJ.
JT Compher has been excellent
I would have to say Hayton or Maccelli.  We have some guys that are budding and could really pay out here in the next two years but they get drowned in the news *around* the Coyotes or hidden by how not great the Coyotes play over all.
Foegle.
No one lol, Barron has been decent though
Hampus Lindholm. Not even mentioned on the Norris thread
I would have said Rantanen but I think with his 50th goal yesterday it made some buzz.  Honestly, Georgiev.  He’s quietly in the top 5 for most goalie statistics
Casey Mittelstadt somehow has 50 points
Doug Glatt from the Halifax Highlanders had a strong campaign for a player many considered underrated heading into the season.
Since you already mentioned Tommy Novak, Luke Evangelista is a smaller sample size but is playing amazing and producing at a 52 point pace as a 21 year old rookie.
Pavel Buchnevich. If it weren't for injuries, he'd be at 80+ points right now.  Also, Alexi Toropchenko is starting to come into his own and will be electric in the years to come.
Jason Zucker
Sergachev has 60 points in 77 games, and he's looked great in most of his outings. He seems to get overshadowed by Stammer, Kuch, Vasy and Pointer tho which I guess makes sense.
J.T. Compher has really stepped up to fill the gaps in the face of all our injuries.  Not a superstar, but he sure contributes.
Ullmark is gonna win the Vezina because a sub-2 GAA is insane but holy fuck Juuse Saros has been so goddamn good.
Jonathan Drouin.  Around a half point per game player but you'd swear he scores in our own goals when you listen to the media
I’ll get downvoted for this,  but Jonathan Drouin.  Since January he’s been great, he is second on the team for assists, and they are usually beautiful.  People love to shit on him because it’s “trendy” and complain because he’s not a superstar, but he’s a great 2nd line player and sets up his teammates consistently.
While I still think Spurgeon and Brodin are underrated, Middleton has been incredibly solid as well but literally no one talks about him.  He's been an excellent addition to our blueline.  Basically our 3rd Dman at 2.45mil.
Roope Hintz
Vincent Trocheck. Outstanding on face offs, has an edge to him, and has just been solid all year despite swapping line mates a whole lot. Great pickup for us
Oh my god I was going to say tommy Novak
Tommy Fuckin' Novak, dude looks like an intern for a business firm.
y h i
He's played for both my favorite teams and killed it each time. Hope he retires a Flame.
pretty good number for 4.25M AAV
I love seeing that, maybe my favourite former King on another team other than Quick
his contract is amazing too. I believe he's at 4.2mil?
He’s been so clutch too, he should’ve gone to the all star game instead of Kadri imo.
That's awesome!  I'm happy he's doing well. He was great with the Habs
I love him
TYLER FOLI I’LL TELL YA BOY
I'm in a keeper league. I already had Huberdeau and decided to draft Toffoli thinking that he would absolutely light it up with Huberdeau feeding him the puck...Well at least Toffoli kept up his end of the bargain.
Have you guys sent us a gift basket yet, by the way, you know, to thank us for Benning.
He's great. Always fun to watch wherever he plays. I'm pretty sure I have his rookie card somewhere.
I really like Toffoli. Wish he was an Oiler.
He has always been underrated for some reason
I love how everyone loves Tyler Foli, I am a Kings/Habs fan so I was sooo fucking hyped when we got him. I'm so happy he's still tearing it up.
Dahlin and Power are just opposites as far as offensive dmen go. Dahls has a lot of sparkle and pizazz to his game (plus a mean streak) whereas Power just understatedly does a lot of brilliant things.  Both are ridiculously talented, not trying to say one is better than the other of course.  Also to tack onto this list--Mittelstadt has 41 assists. That's just shy of his assist total for his previous ~4 seasons combined. If he could bury the puck a little more often I think he'd be turning a lot of heads.
Gotta be Mittelstadt imo.    99% of fans outside Buffalo would still think he’s a bust and a wasted pick but don’t realize how much he’s produced this year. Haven’t heard a peep about him all year.
Not to mention Dylan Cozens was that productive with two rookies being 20 (for half the year) and 21 years old
Dylan Cozens is a two way play driving force that can also play all the 1st line special teams  If Zegras somehow gets like 2M aav more than him, I’m gonna laugh
Sounds like my good pal Adam Fox
Power’s disproportionate rostered % and points per game in fantasy reinforces this theory. He’s consistently the #1 recommended free agent in my league even when he’s not putting up numbers.   Ranked 117th, averaging 1.3 points per game which is really low for a defenseman but rostered in 55.9% of leagues across ESPN.  For some perspective Ryan Graves on the devils has a 1.7 points per game average and is ranked 40th and is rostered in only 22.8% of the leagues.
As someone who has maybe watched 10 Panthers games this season, Luostarainen has really stood out. Would love him on my team
Yeah I thought he had a chance at making the team out of camp but he has absolutely blown away the expectations I had for him prior to the season. Especially considering he’s making barely league minimum.
Skjei and Chatfield definitely would be my two, also Noesen.   Skjei has arguably been our 2nd best defensive defenseman (behind Slavin) while also putting up almost 20 goals.
:( can we have him back
I love Chatfield, ever since he was on the Canucks. I’m mad they didn’t keep him around but I’m happy he went to a better team
Skej is gonna have a breakout year in the next two where people outside of Carolina are going to start noticing
I don’t know if he’s underrated at all in Carolina but Brent Burns has been a great fit. I can’t believe they got him with salary retained, he’s still very good.
Montembeault is such an awesome name too
I feel like we see him in a lot of lists about goal saved over expectation or stuff like that, he's been really good and I also am on the Monty hype train since last year.  I feel like for Montreal I'd pick Harris or Kovacevic, both had sneaky good seasons for different reasons but both went beyond expectations.
His advanced stats have been quite good. He has 14 goals saved above expected. His goals saved above expected (per 60) places him inside the Top 10 out of qualifying goalies in the NHL
If Karlsson wasn’t having a stupid good offensive season Dougie’d be getting more love (probably). His production has been great though.
Yup I agree. Dougie Hamilton is having a career year on an team that most people didn't pick to even make the playoffs before the season started.   Everyone is riding the Makar and Fox hype train. Lindholm and McAvoy are putting on a clinic in Boston. Erik Karlsson, previously thought of to be the league's worst contract, suddenly puts up a career season and will probably win the Norris.  I think Hamilton is also in that tier of elite defenseman but gets barely any mention.
Man, I miss Dougie. Happy to see his success in NJ.
Anyone on the devils is having an underrated season Dougie, hischer even vanechek and a few others but It how it goes nhl is just going lights out this year across the board
Other than the Taylor Hall MVP year, that’s the most points by any Devil since the 2011-2012 season, featuring Kovalchuk with 83 and Elias with 78. I would love for Dougie to reach Patty’s points and take the all time record
Came in here to hype up Marino, glad Dougie is the number 1 answer in the thread though.
Ristolainen, too
He's been pleasantly productive this year. Maybe Jackson will join him in the next couple years.
Man I remember playing against him back in high school in Minnesota, kid was scary good.
I feel like the Flyers have a few guys that are kind of underrated and having good years. In the few Flyers games I’ve seen TK has been great, Cates and Tippett have looked quite good and apparently Morgan Frost has been a bit of a menace lately  My best buddy is a Flyers and he was committed to the Bedard sweepstakes but I had to keep telling him that the Flyers may be bad but they still have a decent amount of quality talent. Plus with Torts coaching them that they were never gonna be in serious contention for the Bedard-off
Dowd & Strome for sure
Nick Jensen too. Very quietly held down the top pair RD slot for half a season with John Carlson out. The Caps problem this season can’t really be said to be defense, at least not the biggest problem. They just couldn’t score more than two goals most of the year.
Best 4th liner in the league
Still crazy to me to see his improvement. He couldn’t even crack our lineup consistently when we sucked.
EEk is one of the best all around players in the league imo. he isn't flashy enough to receive the attention he deserves tho
At this point he's got enough attention you can't call him underrated any more. Sadly the Wild might feel his injury even badly than Kaprizov's. If he's not back we're prone to a very short postseason.
The fact that I haven’t really seen anyone with him in their Norris conversation is just absurd. Pretty sure having 2nd most points among defensemen and being much more defensively sound than Karlsson should put you in the running.
Is that the brother of NJ Devils legend Luke Hughes?
It's just wasted breath for what Karlsson is doing. We all know the Norris is a reputation based award anyway.
Buddy can’t even be a top 2 scorer on his team, what a pigeon!
Nurse and Hyman also hitting career highs behind the scenes
How many points come from assuring or getting assists from mcdrai? Gotta be half of his points no doubt?
Jones is just a classic example of a player that people circlejerk so much as being overrated that he becomes very underrated.
It really depended on him recovering from the ankle injury he had, but the trade is all about how bad a trade is having more to do with how it fits the strategic outlook of the team than about a raw win/lose.
Subscribing to Zacha facts
Zacha always had that defensive prowess. Things in NJ just never clicked for some reason! Perfect case of just needed a change of scenery
Unironically so proud of him. I'm obviously ecstatic at the Devils surprise season but I wish Zacha could've been a part of it.
I have nothing but love for Zacha. Glad he’s working for you all. Excited for our game tomorrow!
Adding cliffy hockey to the conversion. He’s had an incredible year, kinda quietly.
Pablo Zaka is doing the damn thing
Sssh.   You're not supposed to tell people about Barabanov.  Sneaky little dude gotta stay sneaky.  (Seriously though, he's fun to watch, and definitely flies under the radar.)
He’s just happy to be home
Also Pavs putting up another nearly PPG season at 38. 75 in 78 and at 999 for his career.
I love Roope. Feels like he’s frequently injured
I watched a couple sharks games lately and thought he was decent! Wasn't sure if I just saw a couple of his good games. Really glad he's playing ok again he was such a great shut down guy on those beastly sharks teams. Guessing injuries got him?
Wat?  Joshua and Aman have been getting [completely cratered](https://www.nhl.com/stats/skaters?report=summaryshooting&reportType=season&seasonFrom=20222023&seasonTo=20222023&gameType=2&position=F&playerPlayedFor=franchise.20&filter=gamesPlayed,gte,1&sort=satTotal,usatTotal&page=0&pageSize=50) this year.
You're welcome
I've always wondered why Crouse isn't a trade target every deadline. Big, mean, skilled middle 6 winger. Just what most teams would love to have.
How was he a cap dump return?   He *was* the return. Hughes specifically asked for him and he's pretty much all we got back in that trade. We were looking for a younger roster player, which is what we got.  I agree he's the right pick for the Habs, but you're underselling him here.
Glad he’s working out there. God damn that dude single handily made watching the panthers a stressful experience. He made some of the nicest plays for a dman I have ever seen (OT vs the Devils idk what year or what game but it was one of the most beautiful OT finishes I have ever seen) but talk about an absolute liability. Andddd then came Keith Yandle…
He was a cap dump over Petry? I thought their reasoning was that they wanted veteran guys? I never understood that trade from day 1.
What? In what world was Matheson a cap dump?
I would say Marchenko with his goals per game is my CBJ nominee.
Jensen is just such a reliable player
Came here to say Darnell as well!
Ekholm is so damn good. He also helped Bouchard find his games
I get plus/minus can be a flawed stat but being a team leading +22 isn't a fluke. He has a tendency to make “big mistakes” but he plays a ton of ice time against the other teams best players. Oilers are definitely better with than without.
People were pretending that he was a liability and a bottom 6 Dman for the first half of the year when he was really solid, it was mind-boggling
Jarnkrok too. Only guy outside of the big four who seems to be able to consistently contribute in the top six.
Is it wrong to suggest Nylander isn't getting near enough talk about his year?
Järnkrok has gone from a bottom six filler to probably playing with Matthews in the first playoff game.   Also.. Holl.. he wasn't good at the start or in the middle and most of us (me included) just wanted to see him gone. But he's been very solid recently, and I think we were way too hard on him even when he wasn't doing as great.
Zucker has been healthy, which I didn’t really expect. Guy is awesome when he’s out there
Top 6 all performing well and bottom 6 have all been dreadful. But if I had to pick I have really been enjoying Drew O'Conner game the past month after watching him best vasi from about 15 feet behind the goal
Novak is my pick too, he’s had an outstanding season since his call up and I hope he, along with the rest of our younger core, continue to break out and fast track our rebuild
I say Tommy Novak is our future in every thread because he's been nuts.
I'd say Georgiev. There were so many questions about him when we made that trade and he's been playing like a top 10 goalie all year
100% it's been Compher. And just like Kadri, he's priced himself out of Colorado with a career year.
The NHL didn't even list him as an option for the Calder, which is insane. He's been better than power, who gets sheltered with ozone starts, yet had 1/4 the fanfare
Was wondering who it could be from us, Kreids is a good one.  Trocheck quietly putting up his 2nd most productive season, points-wise. And that's with something like 10 posts hit.
He’s awesome
Damn he is good, didn't realize all that. Buffalo quickly becoming a favorite team of mine. Thompson was already one of my favorites and I really like Cozens too
And he’s a two way player that plays very effectively on both special teams.   Cozy is one of my favs on the team. Him and Tuch are cut from the same cloth
A few of our bottom 6 are having career best seasons (Klim, McLeod, Foegele), nursey too.   The numbers might not pop compared to the rest of the league but it’s encouraging
He’s hella smart out there
Love that guy, glad he’s still in the league even if it is on the rangers
Agreed. I was dismayed he got no 7th player consideration.. I'm neutral on him previously, but this year, outstanding 2 way game
Not to mention he’s just a wonderful human.
I wish he would have been more successful in Seattle, miss him on the ice
I think it's pretty obvious he wasn't ready to be an NHL center. Bringing in Copp allowed Rass to just play hockey without overthinking.
I am so glad he is going to be here for a bit
You're welcome
He’s gonna get a lot of recognition in the playoffs. He’s a sensational player just waiting to hit the national scene. Point-lite
I live in FL so I get a lot of bolts games on 141_DEC_SLOT err I mean Bally, but yea he and Paul don’t know how not to play hard
My friends and I talk about it fairly often. Mostly because I have Gus in our fantasy league, and our one friend is a Sens fan
It's definitely being talked about more recently - at least on this subreddit - after Talbot was healthy scratched.   I'm glad it worked out for Minny and Gus. I don't know that he was ever seriously projected by Sens management to be one of their many futures in the goalie pipeline.
His brother is a bit underrated for us. Noticeable growth from his rookie year last year, especially in faceoffs and defensive play, fast as hell, bypassed his previous point totals despite dealing with two fairly bad injuries that have interrupted his season.   A great young 3/4C who’s occasionally plugged into the top 6 when needed. Needs to build his confidence offensively a bit because he tends to hang around the perimeter a lot, but he has all his success when he’s aggressive. Unfortunately he’s mostly flown under the radar until he had a major error in our loss to Toronto, then people shat on him for a while.
Tuch is incredible and basically does everything at a high level (defense, special teams on both ends, shooting, scoring, playmaking and especially skating). He was a godsend to Buffalo. And he plays his heart out for this team. It’s rare to have one of the more skilled guys on the team also have the highest level of compete. He an absolute dawg/hound on the ice. He’s everywhere. 71% of the world is covered by water, the rest is covered by Alex Tuch.   And it’s cool that Buffalo basically has two Tuch’s because Dylan Cozens is the same breed. These guys go 100% when they are on the ice
Controversial, but I think you're right. So much focus is on the prospects right now, Larkin quietly having a career year is underrated.
I don't know why you're getting downvoted. He's not scoring as many goals this year but is playing better defense, which often gets overlooked.
People have been basically counting down his points til he hits 100 in the few postgame threads I've seen from what I could tell lol
May not get a lot of minutes but you always notice Lomberg. He was in the Flames system for a while but I guess it didn't work out. Kinda like Bennett. And Tkachuk. Sigh.
With being a cup winner in LA he’s had a pretty amazing career. Absolutely loved him when he was in Mtl
Yeah, it's fine, but let's check and see what Jake Virtanen is doing  ..god dammit
Just give Jim 5 more minutes
Mittelstadt is a great answer too. He is definitely underrated amongst our fans right now. He’s been a different player the second half of the season.
Dahlin also comfortably leads the league in minor penalties where power has nowhere near the struggle in that regard
I know it's irrelevant to the thread so I apologize, but that sounds just like McDrai. McDavid is flashy and sparkly, while Draisaitl just does smart brilliant things.
99% of fans inside of Buffalo still think he’s a bust hahah. He’s been great lately.
mitts makes blunders that are really easy to notice and is mostly a setup guy, so all the things he does well tend to fly under the radar with more casual fans. i think if he can improve his finishing game next year they’ll start to come around.
I think Cozens is going to be amazing once we finally get back to the playoffs. He’s so good at just skating super hard in a straight line hahah
Prepare to laugh, Anaheim is definitely going to pay Zegras a huge amount. Which goes back to my original point, Zegras is Anaheim’s golden boy (at least from the outside looking in) and Cozens is just another one of our great young pieces.   Anaheim fans can tell me if I’m wrong but I’d guess zegras gets 9-10 mil a year which is more of a reflection on how much of a steal Cozens contract could be than Zegras not deserving that.
Definitely not underrated around these parts, he set a new team record for most points from a defenseman - taking the crown from none other than TDA. So it's a double win.
fuck dought hamilton
Same
Uh, did you forget about that Hughes guy or something?
Ristolainen is one of the most surprising players on this list. Over the years  he has faced a lot of criticism and for a good reason. Now it seems like he really has been a player who deserves a spot on the top D-lines and he probably makes the Finnish IIHF team as well.
Very doubtful with Jackson.  Noah has always been levels above Jackson.  Noah has always been a solid NHL projected prospect.  Jackson was a surprise that he was even given a contract by us and will never be more than fringe NHLer.
Great call on Strome. Buddy had a career year.
Put him on the SO squad, and folks would take notice. His mitts are so silky, they belong draped over the shoulders of ancient monarchs
I am still mad that Chiarelli traded for Reinhardt instead of just drafting Eriksson Ek like they were originally going to do.
Yep, he’s not even being talked about on that Norris thread.
matthews 😶
If Hyman didn’t have all those called back goals, he’d finish the season with about 45 goals.
Nuge is the straw that stirs the drink on the Oilers PP. of course McDrai are important, but look at the PP numbers with and without RNH and it’s quite a difference.
He has more goals than Mitch Marner, who is lighting it up tremendously according to Canadian media.
Take away half his points and he's still top 3 on your trash team
Hurt durr durr product of McDrai hurr durr. Guy has 100 points, give him some credit.
The Toews special
I miss my dad :( I'm glad you guys are taking care of him
Yep, he’s injured right now
i dont honestly know. it feels like the league has just gotten way too fast for him and he cant keep up. he looks like he always does but it just doesnt work anymore.
Playing in front of historically bad goaltending and horrendous defense for most of the season will do that. If you watch the games it’s pretty clear that Joshua and Aman have been legitimately good bottom 6 players.
Mainly because we don’t want to move him. Teams have tried, but he wants to be here and we want him here, plus he’ll be on Cooley’s wing next year
Montreal and the islanders are probably the only teams in the league where 29 is considered “younger”
Petry's wife was vocal about Canadian rules during Covid and cross border travels. It made it hard for the family to gather so it was well known he was gone to an American team. We got a hometown vet in return with Matheson and has played great. Petry had a good run here but with the team getting younger this deal worked for everyone involved.
He's been a bright spot during this very long and sad season.
Ekholm was exactly what the Oilers needed. Great pickup.
To be fair, all defensemen are technically bottom 6 defensemen.
So many hockey fans will see a defenseman make 1 mistake or simply get beat, and label them as a bum. There’s a sect of Preds fans that have decided that Dante Fabbro is the biggest defensive liability on the team. I’ve seen them call for him to be traded for a 7th round pick, that he’s a sub-NHL player, etc.
Man I wish it worked out for Jarnkrok in Calgary. Failed experiment but he's obviously a good player
As a leafs fan I think Willy has been talked about enough.  Say he finishes with 85 points, that's not that crazy. He's 40th in league scoring over the last 5 seasons with 290 points in 332 games.  Over the last 5 seasons he has a 71 point average in 82 games, up this season to a 86 point pace campaign.  A 15 point increase over the last 5 year average is good, but not insane. Willy, especially among leafs fans hasn't exactly done this quietly.
He’s cooled off in the last month, which is why he hasn’t been talked about as much.
I was gonna say Zucker.  Guy's been out heartbeat.  Honorable mention to DOC, Poehling, and the Big 3.
Fair point. I think I was more optimistic than many - he's definitely played well but I was kinda expecting that.
Trocheck is great on face offs too. Tough too.
I think you can put Mika up there too he is the most low key 1C in hockey tbh. You just ever hear about him but he's a stud.  Also chytil is having a great season
I tossed Kakko out there.  Probably the least mentioned of the kid line.
Best part is we will be paying them both $7.1 million for the next 8 years.
Conspiracy theory: Coop has been keeping the Point, Kuch, Hagel line hidden on purpose. Strategy going into the playoffs.
that probably is the case from what i’m seeing. Having two young goalies already in their pipeline.
Dude it always blew me away just how many times I’ve seen that dude plow 200 feet across the ice and then just score from behind the fucking goal line. Fucking beast. I was really happy to see just how psyched he looked to go to Buffalo.   I am so glad he’s doing well with you guys.
That’s right my man.
Let’s see Jake Virtanen’s card
I hated him early in the season but the kid has really come along nicely.
Everytime we played you guys he just kept making great plays and I would here his name all game. Definitely someone that flies under the radar for most people
I don't know if he'll get 9-10m but I'd pay him whatever he wants he's fucking phenomenal, if he had a competent coach and better linemates he'd easily be a point-per-game player, he's also improved leaps and bounds defensively this year
Zegras should probably get 6 million. Dude shouldn’t even sniff 9-10 million that’s crazy
What comp are you taking that you think Z is getting 10 million?
Sorry, I meant to say that would be the most points by any devil in any season since 2012 prior to this one
Looks like you struck a nerve with this one
He'd also have a reasonable shot at hitting 100 points
We living rent free these days
How about u get you head outta your ass and realize that marner is like twice the player nuge is. Let’s be real here
Our team plays defense tho that’s why. Nuge would be our 3rd defenseman and like 4th best play lmao
Yeh I’ll give mcdrai some credit for making a 50-60 point player a 100 point players it’s truly unreal
Honestly, it feels like he's taking care of us! Helped make Robo and Hintz legit first liners. Has done so much for the team's work ethic overall. Has Wyatt Johnston living with his family... the list goes on.  I still liked him in SJ even when we were divisional rivals. There are some guys that just earn your respect.
Petry decided to become a first liner after he turned 30, so getting basically a Jeff Petry that is 6 years is younger remains a win.
It definitely worked for Montreal lol
Except when we play 7D, then the top guy is not a bottom 6 defenseman  If you're not first, you're last I guess
And they’ll pay extra attention to when that one in particular fucks up. They’ll always notice and cry when Nurse fucks up but never when anyone else does
He's probably a top six tweener having a career year. Excellent shot. We love him.
The goal race between him and Matthews was the most unusual thing about Nylander's season so far, and not because of his side of the race.
Considering the leafs to me have become more of a defensive responsible team 85 points is unreal.
Ahh, okay. It seemed like he was heading for 100 points.
Such a good upgrade for strome
Yup, he's got a feisty/pest element to his game that I love.  Used to hate playing against him, was thrilled when we signed him.
I think said goalie pipeline has been great for the past few years but it's always hard to predict who will actually pan out at the NHL level.   Marcus Hogberg, for example was one promising goalie prospect but things didn't work out for him and I believe he's now back in Sweden.   Talbot for Gustavsson is one of those trades that looks bad in hindsight but I believe was reasonable at the time.
Jesus. This is really super. How'd a nitwit like you get so tasteful?
Once they switched him off of center he was far more effective. He can't carry a line.
In past years and even earlier this year our fans fucking hated Mitts. It's been really great to see him come into his own this year.
He always tears us up hahah. That Hughes / Cozens / Zegras draft is looking pretty stacked in hindsight.
Shouldn’t and will are different arguments hahah. Def is going to get way more than 6 mil. I don’t see him getting less than Cozens at 7.
10 was probably a lot. Was thinking of the Sabres giving huge money to Eichel because he was clearly our best player. Zegras has produced a similar amount.
So, still Hughes?
*Struck 😶 Happy Cake Day!
~~Jesus~~ Geesus, imagine having four guys hit 100 in one season? Nutzo.
That's how we solve the housing crisis!
I'm just giving a comparison that the largest hockey market will understand on how under the radar Nuge's season is. Get over yourself and your team
Ignore that clown. Marner is twice the player nuge is
I don’t think he ever said that Nuge was more talented then Marner… also, you should get your head out of your ass
Cool. Where'd all the defence get you? Holding onto the last wildcard slot by 1 point?
Touché!
High draft pedigree/large contracts are usually a big part of it. If Fabbro wasn’t a 1st round pick no one would have an issue with him. Likewise with Nurse’s contract I imagine.  Last year when Matt Duchene score 42g 42a, his haters were still saying that he wasn’t playing up to his $8M contract.
Absolutely, but he's still the 3rd best offensive player on the team. But you're definitely right that the team is more defensive focused now.  Leafs 40 point pace player by year-  18-19-Ten  19-20-Ten  20-21-Nine  21-22-Nine  22-23-Seven
yeah, that 2019 draft looks better and better every day that passes lots of studs coming out of it, look forward to seeing all those guys continue to just get better and better.
Add Caufield, Boldy, Seider, Byram and Dach to that list. Looking like one of the best drafts in recent years.
Crazy to me cause watching cozens play this year he’s a much better player.
Hughes’ best season before this one was 56 points
Believe it or not, it's happened before  Boston 1970-71  Edmonton 1981-82, 1982-83, 1985-86  Pittsburgh 1992-93
I'm just giving a comparison how often the oilers fans bring up the leafs. get over yourself and our team.
Good thing I didn’t respond to u.
It gets u far in the playoffs.
Sure but he’s probably gunna set the actual points record tomorrow. I don’t understand stretching for that when the defenseman points record for the Devils comps him against slam dunk hall of famers anyways
You almost Tiramissed it. 🤭
I figured it must have with the 80’s Oilers and the 90’s Pens, but if that were to happen in this era of hockey it would be absolutely mind boggling.
I don’t think I ever said that Nuge was more talented than Marner… also, you should get your head out of your ass
The Islanders haven’t gone far in the playoffs since 1984
Ohhh my last sentence, I meant for Dougie to reach Patty’s points from 2012 (78) and get the all time single season dman scoring record
Boooo
A full season of healthy Kane might do it imo
Really u sure about that?
Hell, I’d be happy if he had a season where he scored ✌️😏🤚x 10
The entire article has great information, but here's the key point:  >The Tampa Bay Lightning spent at least $41 million more than the Arizona Coyotes in total player wage expenditure this season, which is the widest gap ever. Prior to this season, the biggest difference between the top spending team and the lowest spending team was $34.1 million – and the average difference over the previous three seasons was $32.9 million.
i understand why some fans have a massive boner for the cap  but here's what i don't understand   why is there not nearly the same outrage for a team like arizona who technically spend to the cap floor via LTIR than there is for a team who may or may not be holding an injured player out until playoffs for cap reasons??? all teams should be spending close to the cap ceiling. if you can't afford to build a competitive team, you have no business owning an nhl team or any competitive team.
Is this the point where I'm supposed to call them a basement team that needs to move to Quebec or something? Feels like that's what some people are gonna do.
This is why the salary cap inducing "parity" is a falsehood. Teams that don't want to spend money simply won't. The rich teams will always have more money to play with, but at least with a luxury tax, those larger teams are able to put more money into the league
The other reply is correct in that the salary cap has a midpoint(from which the cap floor and ceiling is set) and all the teams aren't supposed to be spending close to the cap ceiling.  But I agree with you that sports teams are supposed to be a rich person's toy, and I don't like sports teams being treated like a business and limiting how much money an owner can spend. Should be more of a free market, but I understand the cap provides more stability and potential for future growth of the league.
Why would other teams' fans be outraged by a team making it itself less competitive? That complaining is always self-interested. Nobody cares if someone bends the rules to make itself worse.
> all teams should be spending close to the cap ceiling  The cap calculation was actually designed in a way that assumed that wouldn't be the case. It's actually really stupid. But the players would probably cause a work stoppage if the owners tried, and since there's an escrow system anyway, there's no point in the owners trying to touch it  It's part of why escrow is so high to begin with. It would only get worse if all the teams did spend to the cap, leading to the players complaining about it even more. And I already want to melt my brain when they do talk about it
It doesn’t have to be Quebec, just please stop throwing money down the drain, and move the team.
Wait until you hear about how shitty finances for teams in decently-sized markets like Pittsburgh and LA could be before the cap was introduced, and how absolutely fucked it was to be a small-market franchise watching all the big teams poach your best players because you literally could not afford to keep them while paying gargantuan salaries.  The luxury tax model doesn't exactly help with parity, either; big teams that can weather paying it will just swallow all the talent they can anyways because it's way more worth it to eat a bit of tax to snatch up a lot of skilled players from orgs that can't afford to pay them and win a title with a superteam than it is try to develop players yourself.  Everybody but Golden State fans fucking hated the Warriors for that exact practice. People also hate the Dodgers for it.
There's no way the lightning have become what they did in a no-cap world. Toronto would have made stamkos an offer he couldn't refuse.
Matthews would be a fantastic baseball player without the Coyotes, great idea.
I don’t even have the energy to care about it anymore. They’ve been this way for thirty years. Never once have they actually been run well. Never had any good owners. Can’t pay their taxes/rent. They actively aren’t even paying to the cap floor because they need to use injury insurance to “reach it”. They’re playing in a barn half the size of CHL teams. And they will be there *at least* another 3 years. What’s another thirty once the arena gets built?  If it works then thank fucking god, the saga is over and they’re a real franchise. If not bettman saddles the league with an anchor for another three decades with his no relocation promise. But he didn’t relocate them in the first three decades so why would we expect him to now?  The org has been such a clown car for so long it’s hard to be mad about it anymore. It’s just a thing that is and must be accepted.   But I don’t want to fucking hear bettman ever threaten a Canadian franchise with relocation again, like he did constantly when the jets returned to winnipeg.
Yea the cap is good for the league, it’d be fun for Leafs Habs Rags fans for a bit but eventually it would get boring without parity
>to be a small-market franchise watching all the big teams poach your best players because you literally could not afford to keep them while paying gargantuan salaries  if you own a pro team you can afford to keep players. greedy owners choose not to.
What’s the little town in Sweden that’s been owed an NHL team for the 30 years then?
Settle down, he not even that good at hockey.
For sure! :) Broken clock right twice a day type deal…
Bettman isn't the dictator of the NHL, he represents the owners.
I got into soccer this year and I'm still trying to wrap my mind around how European sports fans find their domestic leagues exciting. The big 5 leagues in Europe:  German Bundesliga - Bayern Munich has won NINE consecutive titles. They're in a tight race this season but are the betting favourites to win a 10th. That's nuts to me.  Ligue 1 - PSG has won 8 of the last 10 titles. They out spend their second biggest rival by over €100 million. They don't even consider their domestic title that important anymore. They're owners only care about the Champions League.  Serie A - Has bee dominated by 3 teams - Juventus, Inter, AC Milan. Napoli though is genuinely a good story this year and will be the first time since 2000 that one of this three teams did not win a title.  Premier League - Widely considered the best league. Dominated by 6 teams but not to the degree that the other leagues are.  La Liga - Dominated by Barcelona and Real Madrid and it looks like Barcalona was paying off refs for a few of their title seasons.
Yankees have had the highest payroll for years and havent won since 2009. This belief about richest teams automatically winning in the NHL if there wasn’t a cap simply isn’t true.
How could I have forgotten about the north american sunbelt swedish town smdh
My bad I'll calm down 🫡
I mean, technically yes, but also no. The Yankees may not have won a world series in an eternity (by NYY standards at least), but when was the last time they were bad? They've only missed the playoffs 4 times since the work stoppage in '94 and their worst recod was 84-78. They've been competitive for 30 years straight since they have the ability to spend freely.  Quick Google search shows [an article](https://www.baseballamerica.com/stories/world-series-champion-opening-day-payroll-ranks-in-the-wild-card-era/) from Oct 2019, so missing the last couple years, that every world series winner from the previous 25 years save one (the 2003 Marlins) were in the top half of Opening Day payroll.  So spending doesn't guarantee winning, as more than one team can spend and there is ultimately only one winner, but the winners spend.  Now, I imagine it's much the same in the NHL (can't quickly find an article breaking down cap hit of winners though to be 100% sure). Tampa has definitely spent the last couple of years and other cup winners have had some serious talent on serious contracts (Toews & Kane & Keith & Seabrook. Crosby Malkin Letang Fleury. Kopitar Doughty Quick Brown. Ovi Backstrom Carlson Oshie Holtby. You get the picture). What the cap does is allow more teams to be "big spenders". The Canes, Devils, Wild, Jets, Kraken look like good teams but I doubt their odds at the Cup would be as good if the Leafs, Bruins, Rangers, Kings, Golden Knights were throwing 125, 150 million dollar rosters together.
Halifax, NS has made two 1OA’s in the last 20 years. Should Halifax get a hockey team? Yotes are a failed experiment, Mathews or not
Sure, maybe when Halifax's metro grows about 10x in size
Would sell out 5000 seats all the same
It's almost as if the NHL values growth potential
They value the potential more than the growth. Keep hoping man. Maybe when Phoenix is a 6 million person metro you can find 12000 hockey fans. Any year now
Good Friday, Bad Scheduling
Meanwhile, all teams play tomorrow.
Because Jesus forgot to bring a tv with him today and there’s no sports bars on Golgotha
McJesus hasn’t risen yet
NHL usually builds in full off days to the schedule https://www.sportingnews.com/us/amp/nhl/news/why-no-nhl-games-today-league-break-friday/ajgult4rzcaxb8zoymimxud4
Its jesus day, so watching guys get nailed into the boards might be distasteful.
We had 14 yesterday and 16 tomorrow, what more do you want?   /s
Because there are none scheduled
Fwiw every team is playing tomorrow.
Wanted to celebrate the kraken clinch
Dumb scheduling. 14 yesterday and 16 tomorrow.
Cause Jesus died.
Might be because of Good Friday?
No good Friday jerseys available.
Jesus died bro
It’s Good Friday and there’s 16 tomorrow.
April 4 - 11  5th-  3  6th- 14  7th- 0  8th- 16  9th- 2  10th - 10  11th-  10  12th- 3  13th- 15 (original last day of schedule)  14th- 2 (rescheduled due to water break for NSH, storm fir BUF)  Looks like they tried to schedule the last stretch run to have as many games on the same days as they could so that media drama (and competitive 'blindness' like in the soccer world cup group games) could be higher.
WHY ARE YOU CLOSED?????
Respect Christian Pride day.
Less viewership/money on holidays which are popular in North America.
Games. You’re missing games.
Players get paid 1.5x when they work on a stat, which messes with cap calculations too much, so there aren't games scheduled on statutory holidays. /s
Yeah should be no games on Sunday when its the holiest of days.  Chocolate Bunny Day  I won't be able to watch Sunday night as im gonna eat too much chocolate
There are 4 WHL games to watch tonight.
Because Jesus apparently
Christian pride day.
Christian pride day?
Took a nap after I made this post. Woke up to some of the most hilarious comments ever. Keep em coming.
I just got a message from the reddit crisis hotline. I'm dying hahahaha. Whoever referred them to check up on me, thank you
Good Friday.  which makes no sense.  Hockey is good so naturally all the hockey should be played.  all 32 teams should play.  And at the end of each game we'll crucify the refs at center ice.
We live in a part of the word where Christianity is dominant and everyone else has to use sick days or vacation days or make up the time to get their holidays off.
So all of the “religious” players can enjoy Good Friday at home and read their bibles and eat seafood
Bad Friday, Bad Bad Friday
Baseball, everyone is at a baseball game ;)
Because white Christians run the league. It’s Good Friday.
They take the day off in remembrance of the [Good Friday Massacre](https://youtu.be/6B1-c3y_Vng)
The Masters
Because Bettman hates Jesus
A holiday being today.
They gotta get down on Good Friday
Masters tournament taking up that sweet ESPN time.
Bettman
I think the NHLs poor scheduling is a big hurdle in growing the sport.
Because God is dead... at least for now
Arena availability
Easter.
Same reason my coworker ate fish at work
The NHL is god fearing, unlike those heathens in the NBA
Jesus day is for watching McJesus highlights only.
how good can the friday be if there are no hockey games
Coach Montgomery implored Bergeron to take a day off, but Bergie refused unless the whole league took one. The league complied.
what happened to separation of church and skate
Good Friday, Low ratings, worse attendance
I'm pretty sure it's in the CBA that nobody can play today
In the third period, he is risen.
I love that, clear the schedule
This is 1 half to the likely reason why. The other half is it guarantees there's a day that both teams would be off if a makeup game is required. Pretty much every year we see postponed games due to weather so leaving a day off prior to the end of the year is a smart play as a last resort to make sure the playoff start date doesn't get pushed back.
I think in this case it is appropriate to say   God dammit
“Jesus saves! Rebound, Pilate, they score!”  /Going to Hell for this
Our Lord n mascot would support hockey being played today...
We'll have another holiday in June when he does
Of all the reasons, I don't think this is it. Patrice Bergeron rose years ago.
I guess he's getting crucified by Calgarians rn but he'll be back Sunday.
Lol nice
2 today
Big if true
Also: They were all either yesterday or they are scheduled for tomorrow
Life of the party here
Holy fuck, 16 games.  ***16 GAMES.***
It's not dumb scheduling. They want every team to be playing on the last Saturday of the regular season, which is tomorrow.  Because these games are highly possible to have playoff implications, they want to avoid any of the teams involved being on the the back end of a back-to-back.
Dude. Fucking spoiler tag, please.  I haven't even read up to the new testament yet!
RIP in peace
A Friday without hockey doesn’t sound like a Good Friday to me
I saw a whole post claiming this… but there are games on (Easter) Sunday?
No - most years have games on Good Friday.   [Also, the NHL purposely builds in full off days for the schedule.](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/amp/nhl/news/why-no-nhl-games-today-league-break-friday/ajgult4rzcaxb8zoymimxud4). One of those days this year just happens to be Good Friday.
Fanatics fucked up the order.
I didn’t even know he was sick
And he's a lock for the Masterton when he inevitably comes back
I got that reference. 🤣
Not quite - most years have games on Good Friday.   [The NHL purposely builds in full off days for the schedule.](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/amp/nhl/news/why-no-nhl-games-today-league-break-friday/ajgult4rzcaxb8zoymimxud4). One of those days this year just happens to be Good Friday.
So why are there games scheduled on easter then? Good fridays not THAT big
No - most years have games on Good Friday.   [Also, the NHL purposely builds in full off days for the schedule](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/amp/nhl/news/why-no-nhl-games-today-league-break-friday/ajgult4rzcaxb8zoymimxud4)

Do you like basketball? Some bomb-ass games tonight.
Not even close to a Boston fan and would do unspeakable things for Bergeron
Surely hockey is the holiest sport for thoust literally glide on thine feet across water.
There were two games played on Good Friday last year. So unless there has been a change or there’s somebody about April 7 in particular, I don’t think I’m buying that.   I think it was a scheduling snafu. Been a few days this season with no games for no real reason, save for maybe broadcasting issues.
That’s odd considering the Bruins and Flyers face off literally on Easter.
Makes it very easy to commit to spending the day watching hockey. Get errands done today and relax tomorrow
That would be a good idea actually, but there’s two postponed games they already moved to the 14th, the day after the season was supposed to end
That was bullshit. Most obvious spearing penalty I’ve ever seen.
Patrice is a saint. McJesus is the prophet.
I'm no mathologist but usually each game has two teams competing against each other. That means if i multiply the number games tomorrow (16) times the number of teams playing in a game (2) that means all 32 teams are playing tomorrow. I'd show you the math I used but you guys wouldn't understand it.
Holy shit. So all 31 teams PLUS Anaheim are playing on the same day? That’s crazy.
THG is gonna love that I'm sure.
And for some godforsaken reason five of them all start at the same time (7pm ET) so if you are watching on TV every single game is going to be in intermission around the same time lol  I don’t understand why they can’t stagger games by even like 10-15 minutes each to avoid that issue, it’s such a buzzkill to not be able to just flip to the next game once one goes to intermission!
It's an all-play!
I think they try for that on the last Saturday of the regular season  I remember one year, I was at a hockey bar with my wife, and we watched pretty much all the games. After we get the tab, I saw that we had consumed a combined 16 Kokanees. I asked her how many she had. That answer was zero...
THG is going to have a blast
Far cry from the NHL's grand opening day where all of its teams were iced in order to play 2 games.
Is this the first time in Knights history that 32 NHL teams are playing in one day?
Have you gotten to the part where the Leafs win their most recent Stanley Cup?
I don't know if Jesus thought it was so good either
My guess is that when people have a Friday off they tend to use it to extend their weekend and are "out and about" more, are traveling,  or have a nighttime engagement to attend. Whereas Sundays are usually a morning or early afternoon family thing that take place at a house. Everyone eats then sits in front of a TV and lounges.
Jesus is the sickest bro
Shitload of church services tonight. Viewership would be wayy down
It's the 2nd or 3rd most important date of the Christian year and features an extremely disproportionate number of evening church services
Ffs how obvious does a joke have to be for you people to get it.

I love load management games!!!
i have literally no idea why you're getting downvoted. r/hockey's insecurity against the NBA strikes again i guess
That man has massacred my team multiple times, and I would also do unspeakable things for Bergeron.
>would do unspeakable things for Bergeron   Not only for him but to him 😏
For him or *to* him? 👀
Oh I absolutely could be wrong but there are some holidays in the CBA so I'm just assuming   But otherwise good Friday is a big church day so it makes sense to have no or few games and then lots on Saturday
It's not odd because I pulled ot out of my ass
Well played.
His sacrificed his career with zero Cups so future superstars can have theirs
Yeah you lost me at “multiply.”
Uhh, why don't you put down the spreadsheet and JUST WATCH THE GAMES
Real Steiner Math vibes
I’m going to need that converted to tip to tip dick jerking logic.
That's assuming each team is only playing in one game.
SHOW ME THE MATH
You have to show your work to get full credit
Thanks, luv u too babe
Hes still going to have precise details for every game and im going to spend way too long thinking how he follows several games at one time while he reminds me of things that happened in the 1 game that I watched that I forgot.
He'll have to use a small board for his previews .
If you are watching hockey then you're not watching the 14 intermission gambling ads
I feel like you're fucking with me.  Only thing less likely than the Leafs winning a cup is them killing off the main character in season 1 of Game of Thrones.
I dunno, he didn't seem to mind hanging out
That’s why he died
Perhaps 🤷🏼‍♀️ I’m inclined to believe it’s just how the scheduling cookie crumbled. Good Friday has not historically been a planned “off day” like the Christmas break — there were games last year.
Theres a shit ton of church services on sunday with more people spending time with their families on sunday as opposed to friday
I thought only Catholics did anything on Good Friday?
And i repeat. Sunday is a more important day where people are going to be with their families more than watching hockey
Well they’re impactful at least.
Ahh jeez dude I stubbed my toe today. Better put me on IR for two weeks
I have to admit I'm the most blessed hockey fan of all time. I'm a center, and the Bruins are my team. Bergeron is about two years older than me, and ever since his ~~college~~ Junior career I've literally modeled myself after him as a player both on and off the ice. And what a model he turned out to be. I remember going to see him during his rookie year and just being blown away by what a model of a player he was.  I sometimes wonder who the "Bergeron" is of other teams I'm not a fan of, and even though the league is full of amazing players who have incredibly ethics and personalities, I still find myself stumped trying to find another Bergeron. There just literally isn't. This dude deserves a place in the hockey HoF for every reason under the sun.
Same
Not possible. He never stops back-checking.
yes
So not the prophet but truly the saviour.   Edit: take it back 😡
I try to think of it as advanced adding.
Multiply? Man idek what "two" means.
Grew up in the grammatically wrong era of "times it by" did you?  Don't mind me, just an old yelling-at-clouds man who wants to slap that phrase out of my kids mouths.
Luv you too, until you draft Bedard
It happened at around the same time Canada became an independent country.
He seemed a bit cross to me
Might be.  I was just speculating
Yes, but that happens morning/afternoon. The whopping two NHL games going on for Easter are at night.
Right, but more people go to church for Good Friday services throughout the evening... not on Easter Sunday, which is generally in the late morning / early afternoon.
There are 2 games on Sunday and pretending that watching sporting events isn't part of a very large number of family gathering is a very interesting take Cotton
Going to church in the am and having an Easter dinner together at night... which is where the 2, again only 2, games are scheduled
Bergeron did not have a college career, he played junior… but yes, we are very lucky
There have been so many rookies that were qualified of "a younger Patrice Bergeron" and none did anything close to it at all.   Suzuki on the habs seems to be on a good way to become something like that though, the guy never missed a game yet and is starting to become a real threat on offense and he just scored a SH goal last game. Idk if he'll ever be as liked and respected as Bergeron though(probably not but hey).
Can tell you Spurgeon is the Wild's Bergeron. High class, elite composure, responsible both ways. VGK fans feel free to check me on this, but I'd say Mark Stone is the closest player to sharing Bergeron's effect.
You do not speak to Mr. Bergeron.
Ok well now you lost me at “advanced.” Or maybe “think.”
Repetitive adding
Don't you put that evil on me!
Don't you love this sub?Where would we be without the random fans who think they know better than the networks who track all kinds of metrics about viewership and have years and years of data
Make sure you don't eat meat today or else
Meant to say Junior but sometimes I drink on a Friday night, thanks bro 💕
Lost me at "try".
Oh piss off. MLB and NBA have no issue scheduling games tonight. I’m not acting like i know more than the networks. I’m simply questioning the logic. As anybody with a brain should do. I’m not making any declarative statements   Guess when you have to scrounge up every eye possible and are the fifth most viewed sport in NA you gotta do these things so people actually watch
That's not very Bergeron of you...
The logic is pretty obvious though. Based on the data the networks have, it's better to not have games at night today. Also "people with a brain" should try to understand logic first then question it if it doesn't make sense. Otherwise, you're basically down the "did my own research" or "just asking questions" rabbit hole  Your comments also do imply you think you know better. Considering you're trying to make the argument that religious events would interfere just as much on Sunday
It's in the CBA that there can't be games tonight. The players want the day off and got it in their contract.
It absolutely isn't. There were games on good Friday last year and the most recent change to the CBA took place in 2020.
That makes much more sense
Still got it
He's gonna suit up and end our season in game 82 isn't he
For anyone not familiar, here he is doing a similar thing in a real game:  https://youtu.be/fnVYDVhAQLc
Legend :') Have fond memories watching St. Louis, LeCavalier and Richards back in the day - glad to see Marty still has it
Put him in… coach!
Still play NHL 06 where the intro is of M. St Louis doing a little trick shootout play where he toes the puck before shooting it
Is there a rule that prevents the coach from sending himself in the shootout?
Having at Louis as a coach must be pretty amazing. I've always liked him as a player. He has great skill, he's a local guy, and just like all of his ideas and demeanour, and outlook on everything is just too notch.  Really awesome he is coach for the Canadiens. And those players are lucky to have him.   Suzuki, Caufield and st-louis, is a really great start.
He’s suiting up next game
Reggie Dunlop him!
Why does Marty, the skillist coach, not simply coach his team to be like him
this gave me [pstd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msZqA5skPsM)
If only he wasn't so small he might have been drafted. Who knows how good he might have been?
He has made the highlight reel more times this year than anyone else on the Canadiens.
Love our team Coach
This must get the guys going.
Is that one of their actual goalies or an ebug?
Is that Harvey in nets?
They still doing the strip shootout thing?
That was slick af.
https://youtu.be/oMRJSeBgmt4  Reminded me of this.
Games 3-3 with 5 minutes left in the game. All of a sudden Marty St Louis busts out of the bench steals the puck and puts it in the net with the dirtiest dangle ever put to film. Can't lie I know it would never happen but that would single handedly make my year.
That's be awesome haha, are there rules against a coach jumping in the lineup?
Nah, we need you in to keep Florida out
Straight line backhand five hole is such a flex.
16 years ago.  Fuck…
I haven't seen the tweet, and I haven't seen this video. Is this the shootout against the Penguins?  [watches]  Oh yeah.
I pronounced St. Louis and LeCavalier properly in my head reading this, and then I went "Reeshards"  fuck
Same, was a young hockey fan just getting into it. That team and the Broduer devils started my love for this game
I wouldn’t be surprised if he’s in better shape than a good number of players still getting regular minutes. The guys work ethic is epic.
Those 3 are why there is still hockey in TB. They brought that franchise to life.
He probably can't because he's not part of the lineup given to the officials prior to the game.
Aint no rule that says a dog can't play basketball
C'est quand même très fucking nice.
It seems he kinda did that with Caufield. I remember a clip of him showing him a move in practice and Cole doing it the next game and scoring.
"hey, in that situation I would have been faster than the other guy, try it next time."
Hard to make the highlights when you're on LTIR
From my understanding, it’s a practice goalie - but he did the exact same move to Price at the 2011 at all star game with the exact same result.
Contract would be the blocker.  No idea if he can sign a PTO bring a former pro/collecting "pension"?
There's clips of him running up and down the stairs at the bell centre before games. Guys still got god quads
I wonder how close we were to the Lightning being on the relocation block during the depths of the Koules & Barrie regime. They killed interest in the team during that time and this wasn't long before the Thrashers ended up moving to Winnipeg (I understand there were other factors that precipitated that move).   We could not have had a bigger disparity in quality of ownership from one to the next than what we got, moving from those two dipshits to Jeff Vinik.
What? His name is at the top.
https://i.imgur.com/cVw7slz.jpg  3rd suggested result… his legs
Haha
Checkmate Gary
"He's been progressing well and there have been no setbacks, so that's encouraging. I don't know if that's optimistic, it's just he's progressing well. No news is good news in terms of bad news... does that make any sense?"
Mark stone can have my back if he would like
I think it’s more you gotta hope he’s able to play again period. Back injuries in back to back years is really rough. Can’t bring him back early like last year either as if I recall correct he just didn’t look himself when he played late last season. Hope he’s able to recover 100 percent
His situation is pretty scary. I hope he makes the best decision for his health, regardless of whether he gets to play or not.
I'm worried that he does come back for the playoffs and someone is going to crosscheck him and he's going to be out again...
Schrödinger's Stone
I get the concern over back issues but an example is gronk. Dude had multiple back issues before he even got to the nfl and look at the career he had. This injury to stone looked like such a fluke. Wasn’t any particular hit or anything, maybe I’m too optimistic but the dude isn’t gonna come back unless he feels ready.
Back injuries are one of the worst. Degenerative back problems ended Zetterberg’s career and they certainly haven’t helped Lucic. I hope Stone can come back at all, and if he does, it’s far from a guarantee he’ll be the same
He was playing his best hockey before this last back injury. There is hope for him to return, but I heard if it happens again it’s likely career ending.
His salary dropping to 1 million dollars a year ended his career.
They're definitely talking about it during Sharks broadcasts. If there is any lack of coverage, it's because of who he plays for.
Hopefully he can get it tomorrow. Should be a bigger crowd and last home game.  *6-2 oilers win with two karlsson goals*
I've seen a lot of people talking about it. It's likely he'll hit it! Would love to be there for it, I'm going to the game on Saturday so fingers crossed!
I briefly lost faith when we traded Meier at the deadline. He'd have passed it already if we didn't - Meier is likely to be the Sharks leading goal scorer this year even after being traded.  At his current pace, though... 2 points in 4 games is very realistic for Karlsson. Calgary / Winnipeg will both be fighting for a wild card spot, and Edmonton is doing well this year, but I'm hoping he pulls it off.
I'm hoping he gets to 103 points. He'd have a top 10 season of all time, best since 88
Nobody’s talking about it because the rest of his team is AHL players
Yo thats actually crazy
Karlsson has more points this season than his previous 3 seasons combined.  98 points in his last 78 games. 77 points in the 158 games before that. Unreal.
How is he doing this well on a team as shit as the Sharks? Aren't they awful this year?
Whats even more insane is that he only has 25 power play pts. He is nearly point per game only including even strength tallies
Nah I don’t think anyone has talked about it at all
At first I thought he wouldn't do it because he doesn't have the supporting cast. Then I remembered he's Erik Karlsson, and he's dominated without a supporting cast before.
Karlsson hitting 100 will mean:  1. He'll be the only defenseman other than Bobby Orr to hit 100 points and lead his team in points.  2. He'll be the only defenseman other than Bobby Orr to hit 100 points without another 100-point player on the roster.  And this one doesn't really need him to hit 100 but, he should finish with the largest point discrepancy between himself and the team's second-leading scorer for any defenseman that has led their team in scoring in history. He's currently +32 over Couture and I can't find a single other defenseman above +25.
If only Babcock was still coaching.   He could bench him so he can’t hit the mark.
Maybe east coasters aren't talking about it.
He’s having a phenomenal year. It’s the only reason I check the Sharks box scores. I hope he can surpass the 102 points Leetch put up all those years ago. Great story for the NHL.   Sharks fans, do you think the EK resurgence is due to Burns no longer being around? Seems the last few years EK seemed out of place with Burns there. When he wasn’t injured, that is. I dunno - I maybe watched 5 sharks games in the past 3 years.
my goat is gonna get it just to remind everyone why he should never get slept on
Guy is an animal this year, hope he gets 100. Seems ridiculous that a dman is top 10 in league scoring in this day and age I love it.
Maybe Josi just got more attention because last years' preds were much better than the sharks this season. Just like how Keller is having a career year on the yotes with very little discussion about it, for example.
I feel like this season has just been insane in terms of stats. I mean McDavid will hit 150, Draisaitl has 31 pp goals, Ovi is getting closer and closer to Gretzky’s record, Bruins will have the new wins record. Karlsson will hit 100 but this season is so crazy that a defenseman on one of the worst teams in the league hitting 100 may not be the craziest thing to happen this season  EDIT: I think Karlsson hitting 100 is the most insane thing to happen in the last few years and I agree that the lack of coverage is very surprising
I know I'm gonna get a lot of heat for this, but: I think Karlsson getting 100 points is more impressive than McDavid getting 150.
I'm predicting no points in three games then a 4 point night in Game 82.
"Scratched, no personal achievements allowed"-Mike Keenan
It’s possible that both Karlsson and McDavid hit 100 and 150 in the same night during the same game… would be an awesome ticket to snag.
I know he's been injured past few years but how has he not broken 40 pts the past few years and now pushing 100 pts this year? What's changed?
Not many are talking about it. Shame, really. Karlsson is an amazing hockey player and deserves a lot more recognition than he is getting.
Offensively he was great last night he had two points on pretty much solo efforts. Defensively he was frankly a train wreck though. That said he’s for sure gonna win the Norris his offense is in a different stratosphere this season
Definitely thought he was just having a hot stint and that he would drop off after the first half of the season. Been awesome to see.
He had an absolutely atrocious couple of games against the avs
Unreal career turn around.
It is just you, how you think no one has been talking about this for the entire year is a little naive if you ask me.
Karlsson the "GOAT"
Crazy good offensive season but he’s still a -16…
When you don't have to worry about winning games, you can just push for personal glory, i guess.
Karlsson is over rated and was an idiot to sign with the Sharks.
Shame he plays for San Jose
🙄
I hope this doesn't sound too dismissive but my awareness was juiced recently by my Avs playing back-to-back games against the Sharks and I still don't really care that he's close to 100 points. So I'm in a good position to explain why I'm not interested.   Scoring has been trending up for a while now and we've seen so many huge numbers that 100 is less jaw dropping than it used to be. My boy MacKinnon already got his 100. If EK was the only dude chasing 100 in the league that would be impressive but he wasn't even the only one chasing it in the recent games against the Avs.   I also think it's a fluke. If he reaches even just 80 points next season I'll be more impressed with that production in back to back seasons because it'll look like he's back in form. As I said the 100 itself isn't newsworthy what's really interesting to me is, is EK's personal career trending up again? Won't know until he follows it up and/or his team can win scrimmage. I also just don't believe in him, so I'm waiting for him to shove that being wrong down my throat.   On the team being terrible, the best player on a bad team gets the ice time, they get the points.  I know there are counter points to this argument and it isn't absolute, but those are my reasons.  Tldr: Formerly great player still isn't as good as he used to be, other dudes already scored 100, his team has a tough season.  Edit: I regret nothing!!!! Hahaha
He'll probably make it unless they sit him to rest up for the playoffs. Oh, wait, they're not...
That would be pretty crazy for a defenseman to get. Credit to Karlsson for playing better than any coach or fan expected.
Every sharks game I've seen, the broadcast talks about it, even for opposing teams.
Nobody is talking about it because a) sharks are terrible and b) some folks don't want a player on a very shitty team in Norris contention, let alone the run away winner
Maybe not as many people are talking about it because 8 guys are over 100 this season and one of them has 148 points
Erik Karlsson is one of my all-time favorite players and this makes me so happy.  100 points as a defenseman is just insanely cool.  Also, a lot of the hockey writers are follow are talking about it so it’s weird to me that others aren’t seeing much about it.  It’s a frequent Puck Soup topic.
He’s in luck. The Oilers are always kind enough to help opposing players achieve milestones, and they play them twice to end the season.
Bless the mods for adding Erik to this post. Thought it was about William
I don’t care if he gets 1,000 points as Lindt as we don’t win any more games.
Amazing what a good offensive dman can accomplish when they are allowed to roam completely unchained and not play any actual defense  This isn’t as impressive as it seems. Yes he’s skilled but he’s only allowed to play that way because the team doesn’t care to install any structure, and they don’t care about winning games
Considering it’s the most points he’s had in a season by a good margin, I’d have to agree. I think it’s mostly because they’re so low in the standings that it doesn’t matter how well a single player does
i was watching the Avs broadcast last night and aside from Rantanen scoring his 50th, Karlsson was basically the only thing they were talking about lol
I honestly feel like there’s a big disconnect between the east and west like I rarely hear about western teams on a broadcast but regularly hear about east teams
> If there is any lack of coverage, it's because of who he plays for.  story of his career
Which makes it an even crazier storyline considering where the Sharks are at compared to the Preds last year. Talk about a missed opportunity by the NHL.
I'll take that
"I remember we were playing against Edmonton and we were down 2-5. Erik Karlsson hit 100pts and told us, 'If we are good as a team, let's prove it now. 2-5' Did we come back? Of course not. 2-6."
There’s actually a very good chance he gets his 100th point in the same game that McDavid gets his 150th
Sounds like a [Tungsten Arm O'Doyle](https://twitter.com/matttomic/status/1394498097254965249) moment
This is the way.
Man, I miss games in the Shark tank. Great atmosphere. I hope you get to witness it.
I'm going to the Calgary and the Edmonton game for my Bachelors party. Hoping he'll hit then lol!
He is the lone bright spot in a dismal season so i hope as well 🦈🦈🦈
I'm routing for him. What an incredible feat for a defenseman on a terrible team.
Going tomorrow too!  Fingers crossed.
I will be there too. Crossing fingers
I'm thinking he gets it against Edmonton. That game between us that went to OT was crazy fun, and I'm pretty sure he had a few points in that game
His current pace is still over a point per game tbh.  He has 13 in his last 10
He's definitely checked out a bit compared to the start of the season but I can't blame him. It's been a rough season but he's been great
100% he gets it against Winnipeg, lots of records are made/broken against us.
That makes it even more impressive tbh
Hey man, only like the bottom 9 fwds and bottom 4 def
Hey, don't talk about Hertl like that. lol.
Is it? Josi hit 96 last season with missing games.
Him and Meier were the only bright spots...hes finally the guy we thought we were getting and the team he thought he was coming to is all gone...sucks...we were a perennial playoff team, this is the shittiest the Sharks have been in QUITE some time.
Leading the league with 73 even strength points. Mackinnon is tied with him and McDavid has 72.
Only defenseman other than Orr (4 times) and Coffey (3 times) to pot 70+ ES points.
I think he is healthy enough that he took his supporting cast off, and that's why he's doing so good.
It’s pretty much his sweet spot
No. 2 is the really impressive part — he’s doing this with little comparative help
I can assure you Ottawa is.
I think he had some injury trouble and he lost his son. I’m sure that was tough. I think he’s feeling like himself again
Yes. I think previous coaching regimes saw Burns as the no 1, which really doesn't suit Karlsson. He's not the type of player your going to get 100% of if you log him minutes on the PK, and expect to play balanced 5v5 hockey. He wasn't even the clear no1 on the PP and they didn't really find a way to have it work with both of them being there. It just wasn't a good fit having both there filling the same type of role.
Also you have 3 Oilers w/100 points - that hasn’t happened since 95-96 Pens (Lemieux, Jagr, Francis)
McDavid is so impressive that he is no longer impressive.
Not really if you watch Karlsson he is essentially just another forward who takes big risks for points
Na, someone has to score and now with Burns gone Karlsson gets all of the offense thrown to him. McDavid is more impressive because of just how dominant he is. Karlsson I feel may have less points on a better team. Now if Karlsson was approaching say 120 then I think your argument wins
It definitely isn't because Karlsson is dog fucking it elsewhere and sacrificing defense to get offense. Watching games he completely gives up on plays unless theres a scoring chance for him involved. And have heard quotes from the team suggesting they are all basically playing to get him to 100. It cheapens the entire achievement imo.
Well yeah, because that’s dumb.
unsubscribe!  he will get 2 points each in all of the last 4 games, as is tradition.  he only needs 104 to set a crazy record iirc.
I think there are two aspects that go hand in hand discounting injuries. One is Burns, who was the no 1 dman in all years previously basically. Both DeBoer and Boughner rated Burns higher IMO. The other is that the previous coaching regimes didn't give him as free of a role as now. Right now, he's the one counted on to produce offense. He doesn't have the expectation to be there to block shots and grind out pucks from corners in the same way as other dman on the team. He's there to produce offense and hos minutes reflect that. That's how he should be played but he wasn't really in previous years.
>Defensively he was frankly a train wreck though  Almost a liablity.
If it was game 20, he probably wouldn't have made some of the gambles that led to goals against last night like on the Meyers goal and he might get his stick on the Rantanen goal. But he's not as keyed in now that we're at the end of a terrible season.
He straight up just doesn't give a shit about defense. This is the highest offensive season for a defenseman in 30 years, and I personally don't think he should win the Norris because of how absolutely terrible he is in his own end.
Why even play him at the defensive position anymore? They should just move him to forward and get someone better on defense. They are wasting a defensive spot in someone who can't play defense, and a forward spot on players who clearly aren't as good as him offensively. All this praise for a defenseman who gets 100pts when the dude is a defensive liability.
He got 3 points though and only went -2 in the two games.  That's kind of the season he's having. He's an offense creator with suspect defending
19 ENG's scored on him lol, +3 5on5
That -16 is well padded by being on the ice for ENG. How about it at 5v5?
Mfers still bringing up plus minus eh
Are you forgetting he's a defenseman?
Even if 100 points is less prestigious, the fact that Karlsson is doing something no defenseman has done in like 30 years is why it’s so impressive.   Karlsson getting 100 as a defenseman surrounded by a pretty bad team is the second most impressive story this season behind McDavid. He doesn’t have guys like Rantanen Makar Landeskog to help him like MacKinnon does so his point total isn’t simply another 100 point season like everyone else. Getting 100 points on a lottery team with no help is tough enough, doing it as a defenseman is just mind boggling
That's funny the Sharks broadcast was only talking about Rantanen and MacKinnon lol
It’s likely because Easterners are in  bed when Western teams play. Too bad, there are some good teams and players in the West. Another reason in Canada is all the media are HQed in Toronto and that’s what is covered.
McDavid with 6 goals.
Me too lol
Fucking love this pasta! I can read this in Taco's voice
It really is. They're a lot more fun when our team is good though lol
Was just there on Tuesday. Was maybe half full but they were pumped whenever the Sharks scored. Avs took it in OT.
Lol shark tank.   Love them this year and hope the rebuild goes well.
🌮🌮🌮🌮
150 for McDavid and 100 for EK would be cool.
They have two games against the oilers I think.  I hope he gets it tomorrow and can make a run at 105.
I don't know if he checked out or that with Meier gone, there are no consistent goal scorers on the team. He can make all the pretty passes and breakouts he wants, but if the rest of the team is incapable of burying the puck, it means nothing.
He's playing like one.
Josi got 96 pts in 80 games  Karlsson already has 98 pts in 78 games  what part of this confuses you?
>The last 100 point defenseman was Leetch in 91-92.  Yes, yes it is.
Yes
Yes. There's only been 5 others that have done it before. Ever. Anyone questioning the significance of breaking 100 points as a defenceman doesn't know hockey.
Yeah but Josi had actual NHL players on his team. The Sharks have like 2 outside of Karlsson
When was the last time he got to 100? The predators at that time are also a much better team than the sharks are today. This would be an incredible feat.
At least with all the call-ups we have a few other bright spots like Peterson, Gush, Thrun, Knyzhov coming back, Couture having a great year same w/ Barbs.  Not all of it is bleh
I'm glad to see Karlsson doing well.   It's too bad the rest of your team sucks.
Thanks for clarifying!
Excuse me? He's leading the ***entire league*** in EV points?  Ahead of McDavid who is having one of the top 20 best seasons in NHL history?  Karlsson deserves the Norris as much as McDavid does the Hart. Don't screw him out of this one, voters.
Wow I did not realize that. I just assumed McDavid had to have more
Yes, the one year Orr had 100+ points and no one else on the team did is only really a technicality - Esposito had 99 that year lol.
Bobby Orr only meets that criteria by the slimmest of margins because Esposito had 99 points in 1969-70, every other season he had a 100-point teammate.   for Karlsson it's not even close, Couture is second at 66 points.
Karlsson leading the league in even strength points (over McDavid) is pretty damn impressive
You're downplaying something incredibly rare. 150 point seasons are rare... now. They weren't as rare in previous eras. However, 100 point seasons for a defender is and always have been very rare. There's only ever been 5 guys to get 100 points as a defenceman. And Karlsson could do it on a godawful team.
Great commentary. Thanks!
He hasn't even been that bad lol, I thought he was solid against COL last night apart from a few plays that obviously stood out.  Guy is Top 10 in the NHL for Takeaways and the Sharks outscore teams when he's on the ice.
He’s stat padding at this point. He wants to hit the century mark and doesn’t care about defense
How do you not know what an offensive defensemen is
Totally agree
Can you blame people for forgetting when Karlsson forgets sometimes too?
He’s barely a defenceman. Especially this season.
More importantly, EK has forgotten he’s a defenceman .
Hey, don't shoot me for answering the question. :)  I just don't believe it's repeatable and that's important to me for some reason. I am being very sincere when I say if he follows it up next with 80 points, hell, 70 points, I'll give him the respect. I think it's a Taylor Hall wins the Hart situation.   Defense score a lot now. It's a big number I agree but like I said I'm Avs fan so I watch a lot of Makar and he was injured this year so his total is low but he's over a point per game all the time.  Again, just answering the question from my perspective; why isn't it being talked about more.
It’s actually the opposite. There’s fewer other players to steal points. He would have less points playing with better players and he wouldn’t have the puck as much.
Now kiss
I think teams tend to talk a lot about opposing players like that, because fans tend to know their teams well, but not the opponent's so much, so they are informed during the broadcast.
Sharks hate Karlsson. Their sub is full of it.
The only way he’s gonna get to 70 now. This is the way
I said he would hit 70 so I am fine with this
This is the way
Yup 2 against us still
No one gave a shit when Josi almost did it last season.
Iirc, wasnt last year when we played a bunch of AHLers/young dudes and it somehow worked?
Yes that's true I agree, gotta look for the bright spots but overall a brutal season. I think this young core won't round into form for a couple years though, I hope Grier works some magic like DW was always able to do...at least there's a vision...I just wish we didn't medicore ourselves out of a top 3 pick Bedard/Fantilli would change EVERYTHING, hoping for some lottery magic.
Looking at the even-strength point totals gives a different perspective when comparing all the top stars in the league. People argue over whether Drai or Nuge are products of McDavid but the data shows that all three of them are benefitting enormously from one of the most dominant PP1 lines the league has ever seen.  Mackinnon matching McDavid in even strength points with more than 10 games in hand shows how close the two really are. Karlsson matching both of them as a D-man on the ‘23 Sharks is insanity.
I’ll honestly be heartbroken if he doesn’t get it. I can’t think of a more fly-under-the-radar season  for someone. What a fuckin career arc
McDavid is an overrated power play merchant ^^/s
There have also only ever been 5 guys to get 150 points in a season ... it has never been nearly as commonplace as you are making it out to be.
I mean...he has a nose for the puck and can get it out, but if you look at the last few teams that won they all had Dmen that hit hard and blocked shots and pounded in the corner and if your head is down you'll pay. Sure the game is changing but you still need hitting to ensure the other team doesn't feel comfortable or have time to set up and do what they want.
I'm not glued to the teevee every night watching games, but the SJ/OTT games I've seen over the years I've never considered him a good defensive player - I don't really see him hitting that often or blocking that many shots the times I've watched him play. He is what he is, and I definitely enjoy watching him with the puck though.
Lol true.
The point is that it's not easily repeatable. It takes a generational talent player to hit something like that. Even with scoring being up over the last few decades, no defenseman has gotten to it.  AND he's doing it on a bad team.
Look at his even strength scoring. I'd say he could score much more with a competent powerplay. He has 73 even strength points. The next highest defenceman only has 49. That's an insane lead. Only 3 other d even crack 40 points at even strength. Also 19 goals at even is a 5 goal lead.
> I am being very sincere when I say if he follows it up next with 80 points, hell, 70 points, I'll give him the respect.  He's put up 70+ 4 times before. When scoring was lower. Maybe you should be giving some respect already if that's your metric?
Steal points lmao. That’s not how hockey works. If that were the case, garbage teams would have guys breaking records every year.
🫦
Makes sense.  It also would get pretty exhausting to talk about the same handful of players 82 times a year, so I'm sure the home commentators try to mix it up by talking about the other team as well
Probably because of the qualifier "almost" there...
... on a much much better Predators team.
Maybe, but what's that got to do with Karlsson? It's almost like it has everything to do with your own whining and nothing to do with anything else, you little prick.
No buddy, that's THIS year
That doesn't tell the whole story, though. The Oilers get more power plays than the Avalanche (267 to 241) and far more than the Sharks (211, second least in 22-23). In theory, if fewer penalties were committed against McDrai, they would score more at even strength. And although I'm biased, I don't think it's controversial to say that McDavid does not draw as many penalties as he should, despite being the league leader in penalties drawn.
I'll be out $140. I put $10 on him winning the Norris
Great, that's awesome, you agree with the historic significance of what could happen in the next week. I wonder why you feel the need to whine about McDavid not getting respect in a thread about Karlsson, you whiney little shit.
Ehh the Avs had guys that can hit but they weren't their top guys.   Makar and Toews dominated without playing a super physical game.
IIRC he was leading the league in blocked shots the season after he was robbed of the Norris. And finished the season high in that stat.
If you watched the sharks, you’d see that he is not a “good defensive player” like you said, he’s actually a liability. He’s definitely a negative defensively. He doesn’t even play pk
I’ve watched several  SJ games this year by proxy watching Van/Sea/Edm and he’s just out there looking for his cookie. The worship of him is a bit much, he’s not the best “defenseman” in the league. He basically goes out there to pad his stats on a terrible team. I don’t like that being rewarded by a Norris
It's ok that we disagree about this. I take your point it might be harder on a bad team because up free assists from a guy like McDavid scoring all the time. I actually see it the other way, on a team that isn't winning a good individual talent can just focus on their numbers. For example, I believe Makar could score more if he prioritized that more but when you're competing for Ws within a team concept he needs to play more defense.   I'm not saying this because I hate EK or the Sharks, I just honestly believe this is true about the sport of hockey.
I'm not arguing with you, also not saying you're wrong, just explaining myself.   The last time was in 2016-17. I think he was a good player in 2016-17. That's why it's my benchmark. My belief is he isn't as good of a player anymore and will regress again next year which would, to me, prove he isn't really this guy. You don't have to predict the same outcome and it doesn't have to be important to you even if you do predict the same outcome. I'm just saying it's relevant to me.   If you asked me why am I *more* impressed with McDavids 140+ than EK's 100, all my comments are just answering that question.   I suspect McDavid is going to be in the ballpark of 100 for 5+ more seasons. That's relevant to me.

Ok fine homie, but don't tell Reimer 💋
It's absolutely both.  That's a lot of time to fill, and you can't only talk about your players and betting lines!
Karlsson hitting 100 has been discussed every day since February.   Josi was never discussed.    Karlsson fans are relentless with marketing for their god.
Nah, thats the end of this year  I thought last year it seemed like a large part of it was new dudes
[uhh](https://youtu.be/rFeVfwDvTyM)
lmao there's only one person whining here buddy, and it ain't them
You're not making sens fans look good rn.
Karlsson is literally my favourite player of all time lmao. Just pointing out the mistake.
Again, I don't watch a lot of Sharks games but the ones I've seen I don't see the blocked shots or hits aspect of a Dman's game.
Wrong
>He doesn’t even play pk  I wonder if a way to separate Dmen - if they're not going to split the awards for 'best offense' (offence) and 'best defense' (defence) - is to put some weight on PK statistics so you can tell who actually plays D.
"focusing on their numbers" doesn't work when the team around you, who you rely on to set you up or to set up, is bad and can't finish. This isn't an individual sport.
So you don't factor in that Karlsson's had a bunch of injuries preventing him from getting there? You won't "respect" this season if it turns out that it's the end of his peak and he ages out from here?  Just seems like you're drawing a lot of arbitrary lines to be able to say it's not a big deal.
[removed]
lol I listen to Marek/Friedman podcast daily and Josi potentially getting to 100 was talked about daily for weeks
I don't know what you are talking about to be honest, I heard a lot about Josi potentially hitting 100 last year as well.
People were talking about if Josi would hit 100 every time there was a Josi v Makar post
Ur friends are really dumb
Someone’s in love with Josi
World famous. In Ottawa.
This is what Gretzky suggested last week. He wanted a Bobby Orr Award for the best offensive DMan and then a Norris for the best overall or defensive DMan.
I've basically shared my opinion on this already and I'm not trying to obligate anyone to agree with me so let me pivot a little and ask you a question.   OP basically said 1) EKs accomplishment is very impressive and 2) fewer people are talking about it than they would expect.   Given you agree with OP that the accomplishment is impressive, if it were true that people are less interested than they should be, why do *you* think that is?
Keep in mind OPs question was something to the effect of EK is doing something incredible and not enough people care, why? I'm almost the only person on this thread who has tried to answer that.   I'm not committed to hating EK I've been saying show me just one more season of 70 points and I'll be a believer. That's pretty fair isn't it?
Yeah...but people aren't talking about it now. What gives? /s
I don't think it's true that people aren't interested. You can see my comment near the top of the page. I've seen plenty people talking about him hitting 100. OP hasn't, could just be that I'm a sharks fan, or just have seen it where OP hasn't.  If it were true, the first thing I would blame is being a west coast team/bad team. The amount of coverage that northeastern teams get compared to ours is astounding. It's also just a much more popular sport out there than here.
>I'm not committed to hating EK I've been saying show me just one more season of 70 points and I'll be a believer.   "People don't care that he's doing this because he hasn't done it again next year" doesn't seem like a very fair take to me, no.
"EK is pretty close to a hundo, he might do it!"   "Yeah but what about Josi last year, he could've almost  might do'd it too! Why isn't anyone bringing *that* up?"
That's probably more correct than anything I said but I hope nobody sees me back peddle a little because this is hockey and I'm a man. :)
Hiirikoski, 400 games in the Finnish jersey. Respect.
Wait Theres some kind of hockey today??? I’ll take it
Absolute legend. Honestly should probably be the next European women's player in the HHOF  Well and Noora
Plenty of it (major junior playoffs are going on too). You just have to work to find it haha
Hard to have ill will for the last remaining Neanderthal, they are critically endangered
That's ok Kirill, I've got enough ill will for Logan Stanley for both of us.
r/hockey will not accept this
In Russian accent  “Is no problem… is no problem at all…”
Kirill said "is only game, why you heff to be mad?"
Kirill forgives. I do not.
He was Kirillin' time
All this happening a day after he discovered fire has been a real downer for him.
Nonsense, the Oilers fanbase is full of them
Stanley being able to make the entire Leafs fanbase hate him with a single gesture to the Winnipeg crowd has always fascinated me.
Can confirm, I’m not accepting it.
Kinda doubt it, wasn't a hubub in the game itself, plus while my petty ass is still angry at Stanley for pettiness sake, it didn't look particularly malicious to me either. If we throw down with the jets i'd imagine its just because our games get chippy af frequently rather than revenge. But maybe not, maybe we're out for blood
Well, that's on them at the end of the day.  Stanley didn't mean to hurt him and Kaprizov agrees.  Just a freak play.
shouldn't you be driving your freedom convoy truck to ottawa?
This time it's because Kaprizov's injury tanked my fantasy season but I don't like Stanley for that either.
No because muh freedumbz haven't been infringed on
Genuine question, why is it that him trying to pump up the home crowd made so many TO fans mad?  RIP to the fantasy struggles though, I feel that with some key players slacking down the stretch too.
ok so just coal rolling down the deerfoot yelling yee haw
I get was he was going for, and I get why Jets fans liked it, but it felt like he was claiming a victory in a fight that didn’t happen. I would have respected it if he’d won a fight, or maybe even put up a strong effort in a fight that had no clear winner, but the refs got right in there and broke it up before anything happened. Raising his arms like that for offsetting roughing minors just pissed people off in a game that had already given everyone reason to be pissed off.
I'm not even from Calgary m8 and I'm certainly not affiliated with those mouth breathing fucktards lol
I guess but I feel like the actual result of the fight was the last thing on his mind.  He wanted to inject some energy into the crowd and he got that.  I just find it amazing how that has somehow made him hated enough to be brought up every time we play each other haha.  That and the Wheeler locker room clip really got a lot of people going.
Like edmonton is so much different lol
Not to prove your point for you but that was Scheifele, not Wheeler.
Ah you're right haha.  Well I guess I'll thank you for proving it then, because I feel like the level to which that moment has been held onto by Leafs fans was way more than what most Jets fans anticipated.
Now hear me out. What if they put them on the store for the same period and a 50% contribution of each purchase went to the charity! Let’s go Flames!
This is one of the reasons I hope that what's happening with Pride jerseys doesn't lead the NHL to ban these kinds of warmup jerseys. Teams raise a lot of money for charity with these auctions.
That's awesome to read. That indigenous jersey was phenomenal.
Makes sense! Both jerseys looked fucking awesome.
I wish the rest of the league would put the same kind of effort into their event jerseys that the Flames obviously do. Those Pride jerseys are especially awesome, but I think every event jersey they've done in recent years has been amazing.
Are the owners who canceled their pride night's planning to make any donations?
Well done flames, class act, that is how you do it!
They’re beating two New Jersey Devils records? Kinda weird they aren’t looking at their own franchise records for this type of thing /s
NHL won't allow it, it's the reason why they're auction only
It would undercut the auctions to at least some extent, and it would create a logistical (and possibly contractual) nightmare because of the way that the accounts have to be set up.  And after a single occurrence, steps would undoubtedly be taken to ensure that it couldn’t happen again with anyone.
Agreed, pretty impressive how great both jerseys look. I'm a white dude from the south with limited knowledge of local indigenous groups let alone Canadian, but Blasty just really seems to be a perfect fit for the indigenous celebration. But that could just be from movies/tv
https://vanbase.ca/collections/pride-2023  Edit: I know the NHL has their stance as well but here all proceeds go to You Can Play. Wish we could support our teams initiatives a bit better even if it’s a fanattic produced item, quality aside.
Is there any reason they couldn't put those logos on t-shirts and sell them in the team store? I feel like that would be better approach anyways, more people are able to afford a $30 shirt than a $300 jersey.
What charities did the auction money go to?
It’s just a limited release. The sale lasts as long as the auction and the auction has the benefit of being Named and Signed. It may impact a bit of the auction but i guarantee you’d make more overall especially if half or a portion of the proceeds go towards the charity.   Look at Vancouvers. Their jersey is $750.00 still an incredible cost but 50% of that per sale, plus the auction would do better than just the auction numbers. I like the idea of the exclusivity, but the auction is too exclusive.
dam  I'm just parroting what the Flames facebook page said so idk then LOL, I would kill a man to get that chinese new year jersey
It’s infuriating how frustrating the jersey and fan gear industry is.  If it’s produced and worn on the ice no reason they can’t sell replicas to fans.  They’ll still make money auctioning the actual team worn sweaters and us fans can buy these awesome pride etc jerseys.  My other favorite surrounds getting any sort of gear from a retired or HoF player.  I recently bought a knock off Bob Gibson Cardinals Jersey because he’s my favorite player all time.  I would have happily paid fanatics stupid costs even extra if that meant money was going to his estate/family etc if that’s the issue.  But it’s not.  It’s Cooperstown being greedy fucks.  Got a damn nice fake jersey for 35$ though lol
Holy crap that's an expensive jersey
Typically they DO go on shirts and sweaters. The Habs did that, but the jerseys they can't sell as a "product"
I know Vegas typically sells t-shirt or sweatshirt version, which is really nice. It'd be great if they could have reasonably priced jersey replicas, too, like the AHL does.
It’s perplexing to me too as there would be demand for it. I bought the Canucks hoodie because I liked their design as well and couldn’t get a Flames Crest either as a jersey or hoodie.
The Jets do it with the WASAC logo. You can buy them in-store, on Gildan shirts for like, $25.  The Jets just did their Pride stuff through Fanatics and it's literally $40 for a shirt or $100 for a hoodie.
There are t-shirts!!! Went on sale this week!! :) https://www.flamesport.com/collections/new-arrivals/products/flames-floral-pride-t
The Kraken definitely do this!
Yeah Edmonton made a decent chunk of merch with the turtle Island logo
It doesn’t change the logistics.  Retail and hockey ops accounts are required to be separate, and Adidas does not actually produce these - they’re blank practice jerseys which end up having the unique cresting added by someone else.  (The HFC, St. Pat’s, and the military are all Adidas-produced.)  Vancouver, Vegas, Dallas, and a few others have been able to sell their handful of production overages after the auctions.  Do those actually affect auctions?  Probably not, because there’s no guarantee that they would be available afterward  at all.  But if the *possibility* of blanks being available later affects bidding, then it is in fact costing the foundations money.  That’s also not a one-year thing - something that raises an eyebrow and changes customer behavior can carry forward for years.
Bro, I'm still torn about buying the WASAC hoodie. 50USD and it's weird to rep a team that isn't mine, right? But awesome cause and sweet design. Absolutely love that the Jets make that stuff available.
Oh sick, thanks for the link! As cool as the jersey's are they're way too expensive for me and I still don't care for the "practice jersey" look of them. T shirt is way easier to just wear around as well, will for sure be grabbing one!
Except a damn toque! I WANT A TURTLE ISLAND TOQUE SO BADLY.
Ok traitor smh
He's a good person!!!! ;)
It's a cool logo and I'm from Calgary lol don't get your jimmies too rustled now.
let the record show that patrice bergeron's mother thinks they're all idiots for shit like this
Is this a reference to Bergeron playing in the Stanley Cup finals with a punctured lung?
I guess when you play with a punctured lung, cracked ribs, torn rib cartilage and a separated shoulder, players follow suit. What a legend. Really trying to appreciate his last year or 2.
His mom was a social worker who specialized in people with head trauma at one point, so definitely
I don’t know how he skates with that absolute hammer between his legs.
Last I checked cracked ribs weren't contagious but its been a while since I graduated, that might have changed
His wife would know the answer to that.

Good, being healthy is more important then the wins record, rest everybody that wants/needs it.
rest up kings
Krej in particular, let him rest the rest of the season if he wants to. A rejuvenated and healthy playoff Krejci is a fantastic weapon to have
The 16 wins record is the most important thing.
you should rest everyone saturday just to be extra sure since saturdays are traditionally the biggest injury risk days of the week due to the sun or something idk please
Nice try! Not today Satan.
It's really funny that our "grueling" early schedule we actually won the most on the road. and then Mullett magic happened.
So 1 win in 25 Western road games?
1 road win since Thanksgiving. That's horribly bad. Historically as well?
Mullet magic
Toronto just constantly catching strays in this sub.
We're pretty sick at home though!
Why are y’all a good home team? Is it because you know how the boards work? I feel like the puck deflects very strangely at the mul
Part of me wishes that they had been so good at Mullett this year that they were still in a playoff spot despite the terrible road record, like how Golden State is 6th in the West in the NBA right now at 42-38 despite being 9-30 on the road.
Need some more Mullet magic tomorrow. Please and thank you.
The 92-93 Ottawa Senators had a road record of 1-41-0. That will never be broken
I think that win was against us too wasn’t it 🫠
I mean how do you lose at home to the team who can't win on the road.
Whose 9 game losing streak will break first? The world is watching
I'm now curious about who the 1 road win that Sens team had was against
That's hard as hell to do.
It was the New York Islanders
Lol the Isles, of course.
The least surprising thing I’ve ever read in my entire life
That was the year the Isles knocked out the historically good Penguins so it wasn't an entirely bad year for them.
Didn't know this was happening....why didn't we play Canada?
That comes later in the group stage and, presumably, the final lol
Oh the thread title made me think this was the final
uh.
That goalie is quite the goalie
Image reference featured in this [article](https://www.nhl.com/news/mahovlich-recalls-sportsmanship-at-1972-summit-series/c-335739280)
It's not Tretiak's best pose, but he certainly is quite the goalie
He’s been absolutely bonkers. It’s like someone went back in time, grabbed prime Quick, dressed him in a Panthers jersey and brought him here and put him in net.
the lyon king cannot be stopped
Buddy earned it!
Damn that's so cool, couldn't be any more deserved! He has won us games single-handedly! I wish the Cats could extend him.
Ok, but can he not do that.
If we somehow make a deep run/win the cup with Lyon in net I’m getting his jersey. He’s been phenomenal.
If I said I really thought he could do that I would be Lyon.
Another Philly legend.
Sergei who
Lyon on the floor, I’ve come undone
That is a whole lot of shots to face. Granted they haven't all been good chances, but the Panthers should be better at keeping dudes from flinging pucks at the net.
Can attest. Not happy about it, but damn, good for him.
Lyon King fucked up Ottawa big time this part week.
Yeah it scares me. Don’t like seeing a goalie who isn’t my goalie get this hot right before the playoffs.   Especially with how close these things are in the standings rn.
Just what we need 🫠
Nah, he needs to keep going.
I'm all for it. But it feels weird to have a back-up for $12m/year.
Bringing out my round 1 2012 PTSD
Sunk cost fallacy friend, the 12 mil are already spent, that shouldn't affect future decisions. Play whoever's better at the time.
🤷‍♂️ if we win a cup that doesn’t matter. It’s not great but Bob has been coaching Lyon. Maybe that’s where we need him lol
Hence why I am all for it. Still feels weird.
The return of the King
The goose is (almost) loose!
Any time you need an empty netter scored goose will be thwre
When Gus scores, do us a favor and HONK HONK HONK HONK for us CBJ fans and keep the tradition alive.
I still miss posting Goose Is Loose gifs any time he scored for the Wings.
The response calling a guy who was a 5th round pick and has done nothing but break franchise records since he got to Minnesota "Kaprizbust" is certainly a choice...
Reaves breathes a sigh of relief not having to score weekly anymore. Weirdest point stretch I think ive ever seen for a player who normally can't score.
As a team invested in the Wild winning games coming up, I like this news
I just finished another rewatch of The Last Dance so I'm extra proud of the Wild media team for this one
Kaprizov is back and I am here for it.
I wouldn't expect a lot from a guy named 'Gummy'
Twitter sports discussion, regardless of sport, makes me wanna turn off my phone and go do something productive with my life. There’s no shot the majority of them are real people that actually believe what they say
Twitter is a cesspool of trolls.
That’s not even a clever pun either.
Apparently all it takes to start putting up points is to get shit talked by a 10 year old
His mustache looks so shitty too, like guy can’t even eek out a half decent lip duster and he’s out here chirping the best Russian since Ovi.
Twitter is a great space to yell epithets at the void, and nothing more
My favorite is when they say "who?"  Like great flex man, you don't know who players on your team are (Y)
Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, 4Chan...
Hope he goes back to those kids and shows them who's boss
That and whenever people sub a part of a phenomenal star player’s name with “mid” just elicit the fattest of eye rolls from me
I much prefer hockey discourse on Reddit to the others though.
The playoff team with the least center depth just lost their best center.
Well that’s ass for the wild
Still a geek for JEEK in my heart
I expected worse but this sucks.
Today I learned that the Wild’s AHL affiliate is in Iowa.  Do any Wild fans have an idea about who might get called up?  Edit: Why do the Predators have their AHL affiliate as Milwaukee?
Marco Rossi COME ON DOWN
This season has been a roller coaster. Before the season with the lackluster loss to the blues and losing Fiala I expected a firm drop off… which there was. Then we started playing good, and put together some wins. Then we cooled off and were basically Kaprizov and the shit gang. Then he got hurt. And I thought we would suuuucckkkkkkk. Then boldy gets hot, we go on a 15 game tear and take the central. We cooled off again, and now Eriksson Ek is hurt, and I don’t see us doing well w/o him. He is as important as spurgeon/Brodin imo. But I’ve been wrong every single time so far… and kappy is back.
Was this from the shot block?
That fucking sucks. He and Boldy were really electric, and he's such a cool player.   I despise the Wild, but I want them to be at full strength and nobody to be injured.
Brutal news for the Wild. Hope he recovers quickly
Bah Gawd, that’s Marco Rossi’s music! /s  In all reality, I wouldn’t put it past ole Deano to think the 11/7 is a good strategy for the playoffs. Elite 1C Alex Goligoski anyone?
Nah, we have plenty of center depth. It just all sucks.  We've got centers for daaaaaaays.
What’s that I hear?!?!?!?!? By God it’s Marco Rossi music!!!  Marco I know you’re only 21 and have been in the minors all year but please you’re our only hope :(
Straight up. His importance and role on our team is immense. He contributes on plays whether he gets the assist nod or not. Such a beast, and finally finding his next level with Mojo and Boldy. Thank god Kaprizov is back. Hopefully Rossi comes up and shines. That would really be bonerific.
Highly likely its Marco Rossi
The AHL is its own league, previously in bygone eras, there were a handful of AHL teams that had an NHL affiliate, and and handful of independent teams without a big league team. I believe a lot of, but not all, team locations have echoes of these eras. So Nashville may not have thrown a dart on a map, but rather picked the existing Milwaukee Admirals. Just looked, and the Admirals are actually older than the Preds.
Our affiliate used to be the Houston Aeros — players who got called up had to fly from Texas to Minnesota. Now they can fly if needed, but it’s only about a 3.5 hour drive, so not a big deal to call someone up the day of a home game.
Boldy getting hot also had everything to do with Mojo and Ek being added to his line, and much less to do with Kap going down. Losing Ek takes out a crucial piece of chemistry from our suddenly filthy second line.
Yeah, caught him between the top of the skate and the shin pad IIRC
You’re pretty cool 😎
I think there are more aves and wild fans that are similar in that regard.  Mackinnon and Makar are just insanely fun to watch.  However, fuck you guys.
We've been acquiring a collection of the greatest 4th liners the world has ever seen.
Oh. Looks like he should be good for you. Thanks!
Oh, that's interesting. I didn't know that. Thanks for the information.  Just feels a little strange that a team in Tennessee would have an affiliate in Wisconsin.
Huh. I guess I never thought about teams going out of state for their minor league affiliates. In Ohio, the Blue Jackets have their AHL team in Cleveland. The Guardians have their AAA team in Columbus and the AA team in Akron. So it's a little weird to see teams have their minor league affiliates so far away for me.
Hopefully some of his old chemistry with Rossi will prevent skipping a beat
That sucks, hope he comes back soon
Cant forget about Rantanen.   Actually, i really like the avs.
Greatest first round busts as well!
The comets used to be the canucks affiliate. Utica to Vancouver. Ours used to be in Houston. As long as both cities have airports it isn't THAT big of a deal, but closer is def easier for frequent call ups.
Shhhhh no we definitely hate them and don't secretly enjoy watching them when the Wild aren't playing
Love Weeksey! The broadcast last night def needed some work but glad they're giving it a shot.
An important thing to keep in mind during all this pride night drama - representation really does matter.
Great hockey guys. Glad they both passed through New Jersey in their careers.
That's awesome!
white skates comeback incoming
So cool! Kevin's aging really well, too. He and PK look around the same age in the last photo.
Wholesome af
PK HAS had a huge impact on the next generation! I mean imagine using your NHL superstar platform to falsely brand a kid a racist and then never apologize for it! Fuck PK Subban.
Yeah, you never know when you'll get a chance to tarnish a young player's reputation by falsely and publicly accusing him of racism! Jacob Panetta has a lot to thank you for, PK!
Remember the time PK Subban falsely accused a hockey player of being racist then never apologized?
[PK Subban] Representation is very important, unless you're a fucking fa-
Better than Hextall at least.
I think the biggest problem was that neither are good at play by play. They are both good color guys/analysts but you need to have a good play by play commentator for a good broadcast.
his call on the 2nd goal tho 😂. guy straight up tried to salvage the surprise of the goal and called it as if the goal had just gone in even though the goal horn was half way done.
Who was the third guy on the broadcast team last night? Heard his name briefly and forgot it.
Wish PK felt the same way about Pride as he does this, he was defending the players not wearing the jerseys.
And does one Russian guy sitting out a pride warmup really affect the representation for any LGBTQ+ fans? If the media would just shut up about it, nobody would know it was happening, but they feed on controversy. People need to understand that the coverage is the problem, not some dude following whatever his beliefs are.
It’s so crazy but sadly not surprising the story was dropped the moment it was apparent the Subbans were in the wrong.  He greatly damaged a players career and future yet is still somehow seen as this good guy by the media and a ton of fans
Ryan Callahan.
Something I've noticed is a lot of athletes or public figures will push for a cause under the guise of a moral necessity and then remain shockingly quiet or even vocally against another deserving cause when it doesn't pertain to them. PK is no different here.
How are these even comparable?
Well I mean it's not just one Russian guy not wearing it. Teams are cancelling these nights and or just refusing to wear pride jerseys all together.  I'm gay, and I went to the Jets pride night. I had a great time, talked with some other Jets fans that were just like me that I had never had the opportunity to meet before this, and I got to hear videos from the players who were 100% supportive and excited to participate with special warmup jerseys. I know in the end it's just marketing and a way to make more money, but I'm just glad my team did that, and I'm bummed that other fans don't get that opportunity, or have it spoiled by the players not wanting to acknowledge their existence with the smallest gesture. Just my opinion.
This is the same logic used by people who say racism will go away if we just stop talking about it.
One guy sitting out was Povorov. And since him there’s been more guys and entire teams sitting out.  So yeah. One guy sitting out matters.
Thank you!
That's kind of just human nature though. A lot of students that have experienced racism first hand are a lot more interested in learning about and discussing issues of race and gay and trans students seem more invested in lgbtq topics. It requires effort to help them understand the intersectionality of these movements.
You don’t choose to be a minority
How does that question float around in your head and not come to its own conclusion?
Teams are cancelling the nights because of how much everyone decided to focus on the handful of guys that sat out. Could've ignored em, or at least not put 110% of the focus on the negativity and they'd still be having the pride nights. Talk about shooting yourselves in the foot. Pride night was ruined by folks only focusing on the 1% of non participants and completely ignoring the 99% who *did* participate and support the cause. For fucks sake when will anyone learn what's really important. Got noone to blame but yourselves but surely this is gonna be twisted into some more 'hockey culture as a whole hates gays, every single hockey player and person involved!'  Downvote away instead of reading this, and mods will delete it despite making a solid point and not breaking any rules while allowing personal attacks galore just because they're still in the positive. This sub is so back asswards these days. Buncha jabronis i tell you hwat
Who the hell says that?
Teams are sitting out because it’s causing controversy and they don’t want their players to be singled out by the media. The media is the problem.
some would argue you also do not choose your sexual preference or gender identity
How is it any different?
Morgan freeman!!   https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GeixtYS-P3s
No they’re not. People using religion as a scape goat for bigotry are the problem.
I don’t know who Colorado’s two fastest wings are but I like their chances with Mackinnon and Makar as the center and D.
I think instead of two wings it should be one wing and one goalie
Ours would probably be Larkin, Kubalik, Erne, and Walman which... I don't love our odds.
At first I really liked our odds with Hintz and Heiskanen but I'm not exactly sure where to go with the wingers for Dallas.      Also I'm having flashbacks of Miro wiping out in the fastest skater at the all star game so he has to skate with bubble wrap!
For the Oilers McDavid and Nurse would be locks for C and D, they are both among the best skaters at their position, but we don't have a ton of speed on the wing. Kane is probably our fastest pure winger. If we count McLeod as a winger I like the our chances but otherwise Foegele would probably be the next best option.
For the devils I’d go J. Hughes / Bratt / Wood / L. Hughes since he just joined the team
Center- Jack Hughes  Winger- Miles Wood  Winger- Jesper Bratt  Defenseman- Luke Hughes (ask this question in 2-3 days and this will be the answer)
Center: Kupari  Wings: kempe, Fiala  Defense: walker
I don't know but I'd love to see the NHL incorporate Olympic-style events into All-Star Weekend, and take a page from the NBA's All-Star playbook by bringing more players in for such events and not just the named All-Stars.  Using this relay race as an example, each team holds their own preliminary races, at their own pace, and after January 1st they may submit video time trials to the League to be ranked against all other teams.  Two weeks before the ASG is the cutoff time for teams to qualify, and the top four teams send their four relay-team players to compete in the Skills competition.
O’Connor,Poehling,…………, PO Joseph.  I don’t know who that third forward would be…Zucker?
If you switch it to 2F-2D, Toews is incredibly fast, especially straight line.
O’Connor and Cogliano, that’d be a pretty solid group
Can Wood make the turns though?
He’ll make up time in the straights lol
Who's in net for the other team? The Senators' goalies?
Kings RHD and forward prospects is immaculate front of horse drawing. Kings LHD prospects is 1st grader scribble back of horse.
Wild that 14 in 4 games is mainly because in one game, he got kicked out early in the 2nd for a major penalty and "only" got one point that game.
only argument- he plays many shifts where he never plays d.  he dominates with his skating and vision...but he is a pure Rover
Is that good? It sounds good.
I keep getting down voted in my own sub for my take on his performance in the OHL this year but shouldn't he be absolutely destroying it as a d+2 20 year old? 30 in 10 I'll admit is insane but yeah he should be destroying his competition based on his draft year and age. Just my two cents
I was so high on Clarke in his draft year. Really wanted him if we couldn't get Hughes, good to see him doing well.
Can't wait till he comes up to the Kings. I was sad that they sent him back to juniors, he's clearly too good for that league.
There's still time to trade him for Chychrun.
This after he got booted in OHL playoff game 3 for 5 + a game for kneeing, after getting 1 assist.  Source: was there.
Wasn't this the guy who sucked ass in the WJC?  I know that's a one off thing, but kinda surprising given these stats.
The title has left me disappointed that he's not a goalie
Kings and Ducks are gunna be a fun rivalry again
Stupid Kings picked him in the draft where I wanted him the most. Sens fan here, but with our luck, even if he was available, Dorion would've prolly picked Boucher cuz he liked him so much
Something something awkward stride
I have a feeling he's going to be a special player
Really tried sneaking Hughes in there thinking we wouldn't notice
How tf did the Sens catch strays here of all places
Zing
Not going to lie, but despite the stat line, it is Hamilton's goalie keeping them within a sniff of a sniff of a chance in this series.  That and Clarke was suspended for game 4.
Maybe we can exchange some of our 30 LHD prospects for your RHD prospects
On the bright side, the right handed guys are more valuable
I've posted about this before, but I've done commentary work with the Colts, and I was the pre-game/intermission host a couple weeks ago when we won in overtime.  OT lasted 41 seconds and about 35 of those seconds consisted of Brandt skating laps around the offensive zone until he found his teammate for the GWG.  He's like Tyson fighting an infant.
That's basically the majority of modern elite NHL dmen
Counter point: Brent Burns is a rover and he's awesome
Let me get my guy who's an expert on good things
Since 2000, his 1.98ppg in the regular season is the best of any D+2 defenseman. Some notable D+2 players he beat out include  Ryan Ellis, 1.72ppg  PK Subban, 1.36ppg  Dougie Hamilton, 1.28ppg  Alex Pietrangelo, 1.16ppg  If we expand the list to include any U20, since some players have better D+1 seasons and then regress or go to the NHL, we add in:  Tony DeAngelo(U20 D+1), 1.62ppg  Evan Bouchard(U19 DY), 1.30 ppg  John Carlson, 1.29ppg  Evan Bouchard(U20 D+1), 1.18ppg  No OHL defenseman has destroyed the league like Clarke has, it's legitimately a historically great season  Edit: I should add that only one defenseman in the history of the OHL has had a higher ppg than Clarke, but that player didn't lead his team in ppg while Clarke has a 0.4ppg lead on his next highest teammate
Yes i’d say he’s an nhl calibre dman playin in the OHL
Pftt, he's not putting up the D+2 forward numbers that Tyler Boucher put up in the OHL
I think for a defenseman, even 1.75-2.00 ppg is destroying the league for a d+2. 3.00 ppg is nearly unheard of for defensemen
Kinda sounds like he is. Not sure why you're trying to temper excitement for an exciting prospect, that's a losing battle.
For me it's the fact that it's the OHL, high points I expect, physicality and good 200 ft play I dont expect
He's also not been "fine, I'll do it myself" nearly as often as other overagers do.  Lots of times I've seen him have a clear chance to create and he tries instead to set his teammates up, and when those teammates are 16-17, they don't convert all the time.
These junior rules are so fucking anoying. There has been soooo many  players that just are too good for Juniors but not good enough for NHL. And it will hurt their devolepment.
Those rumors killed me
Me too! I was kind of upset he was kicked out he's so fun to watch weaving all over the place.
He was very good at the WJC from what I watched. The story around him was that he was cut from the 2022 team, probably for concerns around his defensive play.  He did have an underwhelming U18s in his DY, being outshined by Olen Zellweger
did he suck ass at the WJC? I'm looking at this stats and he had 7 pts in 7 games in WJC-18 2021 and 8 pts in 7 games in WJC-20 2023. pt per game is pretty solid
If you guys get Bedard I am going to hurl.
I like the sens but I feel like Talbot deserves all the strays regardless of the collateral
At least the 67’s are doing good
Sens goalie so bad even the strays go in the net
I really wish we could've got Thurn from Anaheim. Didn't even know he was available. That was a great deal for you guys.
in the OHL - he is able to play as an exaggerated version.  there are times there are battles in front of the barrie net, and he is at the far blue line.
I don't mean it as a negative!  just to the point of him being a dman specifically.  he is a treat to be able to watch.
Damn. I'm only an expert in decent things.  I need to call in my supervisor.
I think it's fair to acknowledge that there isn't a 1 to 1 correlation for future NHL results, but there's no doubt that he's having an all-timer junior season.
I think that's a pretty good list, but since there's a lot of nhl talent there, I'm going to call him a bust and assume I'm wrong/hope to god I'm wrong
He is an NHL caliber defenseman, and he should be playing on the Kings right now. So should Jordan Spence.   Unfortunately, we have a coach and GM who insist on trotting out Durzi and Sean fucking Walker every night to, at best, break even in game impact.
Good thing he’s not at 3.00 ppg
You going Monday? Think they'll still be booing him? Haha.     I agree he is super fun to watch. An obvious head above everyone else out there.
There's a lot more to the game than points and he was playing on team canada there's usually a few blowouts. Not saying he's gonna be a bad player but he was a turnover machine that tournament and I was really frustrated watching him
Talbot also lets the strays in.
Talbot wasn't even in last game and they got lit up lol
He’s looked SOLID in his first few games too. Dude plays like a 30 year old vet
Fair enough, but it's easier to reign in the unnecessary risks than it is to teach someone the skills and instincts that he has
No worries, I just hope/fear Clarke becomes a great player in the future.
I'm the supervisor here, but vastly overqualified as I specialize in great things. I need to call the regional manager who knows good things.
No hes shit, he should be sent via waivers. Ignore flair.
Absolutely, I'm not trying to say he's guaranteed to be a star because of this. But this might legitimately be the best season, albeit shortened by the WJC and an NHL stint, by a dman in the history of the league
Yeah this right here. I guess this is the point I'm ultimately trying to make in my own sub
LA has 100 points this year. Maybe the coach and GM of the LA kings have some idea of what they're doing. If Brandt Clarke was going to help the team win I can guarantee he would be on the roster.
I thought Durzi was really solid, no?
I'll always remember when durzi stood behind the net for 30 seconds, makes a stretch pass that gets picked off and they lose with 10 seconds left.  I'm pretty sure every single person who was hyping him up collectively cringed and no one has hyped him up to me since.
He's at 3.5 ppg in the OHL playoffs so far.
smartest canucks fan
I'd even go as far as to say he's feeding them
that has been a point of interest for me watching him this season - how much freedom is he granted at the next level.  he definitely has the instincts, and he can take physical play as he is targeted almost every game.
Didn’t Shakir have a 4 point night the other night in the AHL? Seems like a future top pairing for you guys
I'd be worried :)
You can absolutely say that this doesn't guarantee NHL success, there's still some real question marks around Clarke's game. But there's legitimately no precedent for the way he's producing, trying to write it off as something he "should be doing because of his age" undermines how far above the rest of the OHL he is, and places unrealistic expectations on other OHL defensemen.   Plain and simple, it's one of the best OHL seasons of all time, and he deserves recognition for that
>If Brandt Clarke was going to help the team win I can guarantee he would be on the roster.  This is just an incredibly dumb statement to make on multiple levels.
Get back to me when the Kings actually win a playoff round. Blake has done absolutely nothing with this franchise besides rearrange the deck chairs around Doughty and Kopitar and call it a contender. He has failed at every opportunity to clear logjams at positions of strength and address deficiencies at positions of weakness, which is beginning to cost the team valuable picks and prospects.   100 points in the regular season. Whoopty doo. How’s Byfield developing? What about Turcotte? Will Clarke even have a spot on the team next year despite being - at worst - the fifth best defenseman on the depth chart by every metric of hockey? Who is ready to take over for Kopitar? How is our long term center depth?
Walker and Durzi are both fine but ofc have their own problems.  I don't think it's realistic that Clarke should've played all year, Spence could've but there is no room and he can be sent back and forth from the AHL.  Durzi and Walker cannot.
Durzi overthinks the defensive side of his game but his offensive instincts are perfect.
There are things I like about Durzi, his acumen in his own zone is not among them.
Let’s hold on there, goal from behind the blue line
Why? This is like year 4 or 5 of LA's retool/rebuild with Blake. Obviously he wasn't good enough to help the team win with his  huge total of 2 career NHL assists~18pts pace. Ryan Reaves numbers as an offensive dman doesn't sound good enough for the NHL to me.
So funny to see fans lash out on development of prospects when Vilardi and Kempe took a while both to develop and are now both huge parts of this team.
I find it funny that your username is “droppinkn0wledge” when the only thing you’re droppin’ is a hot steamy shit on the individuals that have worked so hard over the last few years to improve your favorite team.  I’m guessing you’re just upset about the Kings recent losses but relax, the Kings have only gotten better each season and we still have a lot to look forward to. Be patient, watch and enjoy every game. Rob Blake and the Kings are doing just fine.
i kind of want Durzi on the first powerplay squad. Doughty's good and all but Durzi seems to have that offensive edge now that Doughty's getting older
1) your guarantee doesn’t matter at all  2) LA management doesn’t know for a fact that he can’t help. He may very well make the team better even though he is in the AHL   3) the second reason contradicts your non-credible guarantee
Smartest guy in Calgary ^
WATCHING THE SENS GET ELIMINATED YESTERDAY AFTER ALL THE SHIT THEIR FANS SPOUTED IN THE OFFSEASON WAS HILARIOUS   BEST TOP 6 IN HOCKEY, AM I RIGHT?
WANTED TO SEND MY REGARDS TO THE 2022 OFF-SEASON CHAMPIONS, THE OTTAWA SENATORS! THIS SQUAD WOULD HAVE BEEN A PLAYOFF TEAM IF THEY PUT A CARDBOARD CUTOUT IN NET

CONGRATULATIONS TO THE OTTAWA SENATORS. YOUR DESERVE-TO-MAKE-THE-PLAYOFFS METER WAS OFF THE CHARTS.
TRASH TALK FRIDAY AND NOT A SINGLE GAME TONIGHT, WHAT BULLSHIT IS THIS!!!!

SUMMER OF PIERRE, SPRING OF DESPAIR
POOR GIROUX. PASSED ON THE AVS TO GO TO FLORDIA THAN OTTAWA.
TRADING GUSTAVSSON FOR TALBOT TOTALLY WASN'T A MISTAKE THE MOMENT IT WAS ANNOUNCED
IMAGINE HAVING MORE THAN HALF YOUR TEAM IN THE PRESS BOX AND ICING A FULL AHL ROSTER
YOU ARE MOST LIKELY GONNA GET DUMMIED IN THE FIRST ROUND, AND YEAH HAW HAW BIG TALK COMING FROM A FLAMES FAN
I AM ROOTING FOR YOU BOYS!
What I don’t understand is why the ice isn’t painted with a pride logo and a flag hanging in the rink.  A nice NHL logo in multi-colour strips. Or is it?    My point is if the NHL is going to support pride night then step up.  Wearing a warm jersey helps but that’s not really league support in my mind.  Seems more like a team  and an individual decision, not even an NHLPA thing.
THEY DESERVE NOTHING
COLUMBUS IS A NICE CITY FOR EVERYONE WHO HAS NEVER BEEN OUTSIDE OF OHIO!
I AGREE! WHEN THEY ELIMINATE COLORADO IT WILL BE GLORIOUS!
HISTORIC
AND THEN THE OTHER TWO LOOK AT EACH OTHER, NOD, AND START PEEING ON BINNINGTON
WE NEED BINNINGTON TO BE THE LEAGUE HEEL THOUGH, BECAUSE OTHERWISE THAT WOULD DEFAULT TO OVI, AND THAT GETS REALLY GEOPOLITICALLY AWKWARD.    INSTEAD WE GET A CARTOON VILLAIN. SIMPLE, EASY, NO... OLIGARCHS
WRONG - JORDAN BINNINGTON SITS DOWN TO PEE - THIS IS A KNOWN FACT
AND GENTLY LAY A HAND ON EACH OF THEIR CHEEKS
DONT WORRY THERES 16 GAMES ON TOMORROW AND YOULL BE FORCED TO VPN YOUR HOME TEAM
YEAH.   FUCK THAT GUY, HE'S RUINING OUR PICK
IF IT GIVES YOU ANY SOLACE THOSE GUYS ARE WANNABES AND NOBODY TAKES THEM SERIOUSLY. THEIR “RAPIDLY GROWING NETWORK” IS A YOUTUBE CHANNEL THAT HAS BEEN SITTING AT 75K SUBS FOR LIKE 2 YEARS. REAL HOCKEY FANS WANT TEAMS AND THEREFORE THE SPORT TO SUCCEED. GO YOTES!!!
THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING. I THOUGHT YOU WERE SAYING YOU'D RATHER BE IN HAMILTON THE MUSICAL
WE HIT YOUR MOM 100 TIMES IN 77 DAYS WHICH IS JUST AS GOOD
FORGOT YOUR CAPS LOCK, BUD?
C-A-P... CAP!
 CAP UP. YOURE EMBARRASSING US
HEY JABRONI, CAPS ON

*JAGOFF
NOT EVEN THE BEST TOP 6 IN ONTARIO
I HAD MY RESERVATIONS AROUND MOVING TALBOT BUT GUS HAS DRIVEN THE BUS TO ANOTHER RESERVATION FOR THE PLAYOFFS
LEGIT THO HOPE YOUR TEAM GETS HEALTHY NEXT YEAR. THERE'S SO MUCH UNTAPPED POTENTIAL WITH A HEALTHY HABS ROSTER. ALL HAIL KIRBY DACH

BUT AS A FLAMES FAN, THAT IS EXPERIENCE TALKING, SOMETHING SEATTLE FANS DON'T HAVE.
HEY! LISTEN! CAPS ON!
THERE'S ONLY TWO RULES FOR TRASH TALK FRIDAY AND YOU'RE IN VIOLATION OF THEM BOTH!
I'M OKAY WITH EITHER SCENARIO!
CLEARLY BOTH CENTRAL DIVISION FANS.
NOTHING WRONG WITH SITTING DOWN TO PEE, AS LONG AS IT'S ON A TOILET AND NOT AT A URINAL!

SON OF A BITCH
OOF TOUGH WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THAT SERIES BETWEEN THE AVS AND FLAMES A FEW YEARS BACK
WHO HAS TWO THUMBS AND TELLS PEOPLE TO USE ALL CAPS? THIS GUY 👍🤠👍
I don't know what's more impressive ullmarks numbers on the bruins, or saros dragging the preds close to a wildcard
Juuse Saros has put an AHL squad on his back and seems pretty determined to carry them into the NHL playoffs.
The heat map of the Panthers offense with and without Matthew Tkachuk is the most insane thing. If he doesn’t come second in voting, the voters have failed.
I fucking hate him, but Mathew Tkachuk has been invaluable for the panthers.
Juuse Saros, especially if the Preds make the playoffs.
In no particular order because it doesn't matter after McDavid:  * Ullmark  * Robo  * Rantanen  * Tkachuk
M. Tkachuk or Robertson probably.
Tage Thompson for giving the BUF fan base their best hope in years.  Honourable Mention: Matt Tkachuk
Ilya Sorokin. Who knows where the Islanders would be without him.
Erik Karlsson has contributed to almost half of San Jose's goals. If they were closer to a playoff team he would probably get some votes. Unreal season.
M. Tkachuk  Pastranak. I’d move him up if he hits 60.   Rantanen
Matthew Tkachuk without a doubt
Mikko Rantanen fully willed the Avalanche into winning when the team was 90 percent an AHL squad.
Tage Thompson
Homer take but Mikko Rantanen. There was a long stretch where he was the only top-6 forward in the lineup, and without him we might be fighting for WC2 at best. Dude's been a beast this season, just hit 50 goals last night (actually 52, got the hatty) and should hit 100 points.
Its Ullmark for me. 38-6-1 with a .937 1.90  is absolutely absurd
either tkachuk or rantanen. I’d love for it to be robo, but with what rantanen did when literally everyone was injured during the season is insane, and what tkachuk has done in his first season as a panther is crazy too.  Think the voting h should be 1. Mcjesus 2.Rantanen 3.Tkachuk then a mix of pasta/ullmark/tage/robo/marner maybe? idk
Jack Hughes
Matty T (Florida), Jack Hughes, Sorokin in that order
Draisaitl
Cam McDavid
Jason Robertson
Ullmark or Pastrnak
Surprised Hughes hasn’t been said yet. Clear cut 1C superstar that helped carry the Devils to 3rd in the league after missing the playoffs last year.
Ullmark.Dude is having an amazing season. Going to lead the league in wins, GAA and save %. 38-6-1, 1.90 GAA and a .937 save %. Those are video game numbers. He's won 5 or 6 games by himself with 40+ saves only surrending 1 goal. And he scored a goal as well.
Tkachuk, Saros, Ullmark, Rantanen in that order.
Sorokin. Dude is carrying his team to the playoffs.
Matthew Tkachuk has been absolutely insane this year.
Jack Hughes. The Devils went from being a bottom feeder last year to a contender this year and he's been the driving force.
Jusse Saros
Tkachuk or Rantanen for me.   Robertson has also been great, 28 more points than his 2 linemates.. but I think removing one of the other 2 would have altered their team's season more.
\- Jack Hughes  \- Matt Tkachuk  \- Dave Pastrnak  I'm a rangers fan, those three stand out the most as the MVP of their teams.
Sorokin or Saros if either of their teams make the playoffs. M Tkachuk if Florida makes playoffs. Robertsons a good pick and of course biasedly Jack hughes
Tkachuk for me
The Avs have had a lot of injuries to a lot of their top guys. Mikko Rantanen has been amazing this year and really held the team together through some tough runs.
Tkachuck or Pastrnak
I hate to admit it, but Jack Hughes. He has been absolutely tearing it up this year
Have people forgotten how Rantanen kept the Avs alive for the first half of the season? I’m not saying the Avs wouldn’t be in the playoffs without him, but I think they would be fighting for a wildcard spot right now if not for his performance.
Ronnor McRavid.
Drai
Pastrnak. Nearing 60 goals for the team that's currently the best in the NHL by 18 points.
Robertson or Rantanen
Saros & Tkachuk.
Linus Ullmark
Sorokin. The Isles would be so much worse without him.
Tough to pick between Ullmark or Pasta because the bruins have just been insane
Linus Ullmark
Mcdavid
The Refs, seeing as how they seem to determine the outcome of way more games than is expected from a non player.
Panarin, because he got us Kane and Tarasenko and somehow manages to not be hated by our fans despite his absolute dogshit defensive play.
Rantanen. Colorado been dealing with injuries all year, they would have been toast without him.
Mikko Rantanen. Dude carried the avs/eagles for like 6 weeks and now they've climbed all the way back into first, on his back.
Saros - especially if they make the playoffs.
Ryan Nugent-Hopkins 100+ pts and his 2 way game 3rd(McDrai) constant member on the best powerplay ever
Sorokin not getting enough love here.  He's been the only goalie who has been on the save level as Ullmark, and is dragging the islanders into the playoffs.
Sidney Crosby. He's had one of the finest performances of his career on a shit team and the Penguins would not be anywhere near the wildcard and in the Bedard race without his single-handed effort. They've had major injuries all over the team but especially to Letang and Jarry. His contributions despite that have been incredible.   Also he's fucking 35-years-old and his body has been beat to hell in this league for 2 decades already as the #1 target of all teams.  Everyone else can basically just get in line behind him. There has been no performance more amazing this season than his with all those variables.
I’m biased to say Pettersson since he has nearly 100 on the Canucks team, same goes for EK65 as a defenseman  Besides that, I’d say:  Loui Eriksson the 🐐
Pastrnak. While his team is all kind of balanced, i still cant stand other bruins fans thinking hes somewhere around the marchand-bergeron level. guy is way ahead anyone in that team bar maybe ullmark
I would say Linus Ullmark. I don't doubt that the Bruins would still be a lethal playoff team especially with Swayman also a very good last couple months, but Ullmark has singlehandedly won some games that the Bruins should've lost.
Monnor CcDavid
Linus Ullmark
Uh… Leon Draisitl.
If your answer isn’t Ullmark, what exactly does a goaltender have to do in this league to win MVP?  You can pick any other player on the Bs this year and wipe their record and impact, and still say that we could be where we are today in the standings without that player. Can you say that about Ullmark?  Swayman is great but do we really think he alone could have carried this team, or him + any other goalie in our system?
Zbad. Dude is filthy. Should be a Selke finalist/winner.
Morgan Reilly.
McJesus
Robertson or Rantanen
Walman for rescuing MO from the clutches of daddy Chiarot
Petterson.  Look what he has done with the linemates and team around him.
Kirill Marchenko. He has loads of potential. If cbj loses him we’re in trouble… again
Pastranak is the only answer not even being biased. He’s on potentially the best team in history and leading everyone else on the team by 41 points
Sorokin
Draisaitl
Juuse Saros. Next question.
Saros, Matthew Tkachuk, Moose
M tkachuk
Juuse Saros all the way. The man’s a beast and we may be lucky enough to squeak into WC with him in net.
David McPastrnak  Not really, just wanted to say it
M. Tkachuk  M. Rantanen  J. Saros  J. Hughes  L. Ullmark  I. Sorokin  T. Thompson  J. Robertson  J. Hughes   Lots of great candidates this year!
So many guys having career years this season.
Everyone on the Bruins and Tkachuk
Ullmark and it’s not close
David Pastrnak  Has 57 goals on the season (with 4 games remaining)  Any other season that might win you a Hart or a Ted Lindsay, just because it is so rare in todays NHL for a player to get that many.  Pastrnak plays Selke level defense as well, despite not playing on the penalty kill or having any defensive zone starts.
The Drai disrespect in here and the media is the most cringe shit ever he’s the 2nd best player in the league by a mile. Best passer in the league by a mile and has the best pp one timer as well.
Drai, pasta, j hughs
Mikko has carried us through all our injuries this year and kept us in contention.
Sorokin dragging the NYI
Ullmark literally scored a goal. He's having one of the best goalie seasons in years, I'm picking him.
Now who wins blackhawks or Preds
If preds make the playoffs off after selling at the deadline it has to be Saros.
I said Mikko Rantanen for the same reason
I'm big sad
I would say Matthew Tkachuk, as well. I'm sure he's got plenty of help on the team, but man! As an outsider, it looks like he's singlehandedly carrying the Panthers into playoff contention.
I feel the same way lol. Glad he's out of our division 👍
I think this is the best answer.       Ullmark is a difficult one though, I'm on the edge with that given how super Boston has been throughout, and the fact that even Swayman is pulling 92.1%. So even with Swayman they'd probably win the presidents' trophy with a large margin.
You shouldn't make assumptions and then block the response.  Weaker than George Bush's reasons for war.
In my totally non biased opinion definitely without a doubt Robertson 😉
He's valuable to the team, but his value in bringing hope back into our lives is priceless.  Honestly, the whole Skinner-Thompson-Tuch line has been the most exciting thing in.... 15 years? 113 goals combined this season so far.  That said, as a goalie, what Saros is doing is ridiculous and he still gets my vote.
Dahlin is our most valuable player.   Tage is really fucking good and it’s been awesome, but dahlin is still better.
The draft lottery
All of that is undone though if it costs SJ Bedard lol.
Yea I see the argument. 52 goals and 98 points, will finish above 100. Carried the team for a couple months and kept them within striking distance of the playoffs.   Kuch, Pasta and tkachuk are all there too though. The top 3 will be a very interesting debate.
Cogs was on the top line and the guy still was at a PPG during that stretch.
Yeah he carried you guys with all the injuries you had this season. Mack still surpassed him in points mind you. He’s also had an insane season
Mikko also leads the league in even strength goals.
This is my vote as well.
The only issue with him is GP. If Saros drags the Preds into the playoffs id give him more Hart conversation than Ullmark. 14 GP is significant for a goalie and has played an effect in trophy voting before.   Id say Ullmark should still win the Vezina, id vote for him if I had a vote, but I don't think you can be the MVP playing in barely over half your teams games.
Him or Bergeron. I can't see a team having a season for the ages without their best player and leader also having one, stats be damned.
If he didn’t have his injury and slow-ish play following it for a couple weeks, I would be screaming this from the rooftops.  Won’t matter when he wins the conn smythe though
It's incredible that Drai is so overlooked.
Easily
I had a dream last night that Dallas won the cup and he got the Conn Smythe. So I'm going with him purely on vibes.
I’m surprised Pasternak didn’t show up until here
Great having him on our second line.  And Meier on the third. Really gives us depth
Ullmark is the only guy I can see actually get first place Hart votes to not make it unanimous.
Imagine legitimately thinking crosbaby has a target on his back by every team in the league. It's bad enough you guys treat him like the second coming of Jesus christ, don't add the persecution complex to the mix.
In their primes Marchand and Bergeron were just as good as Pastrnak now, just in different ways.   Obviously things have changed though. Marchand still has it fully, I think he’s just battling injuries   Bergeron has gone back to his 2016 self. Elite defense, 60 point guy, but not a PPG guy like he was from 2019 onward. Can’t complain at all for a 37 year old lmao  Respect to Pasta though, this is his team now (alongside McAvoy, Lindholm and Swayman)
But he hasn’t played many games, hard to give him league mvp
Y’all are to hardware conversations what people think Leaf fans are to hockey as a whole. We get it, you have generationally talented players
i keep forgetting the isles are in a playoff spot haha
Nashville but it’ll be a fluke.
Brandon Montour has had a year as well, supplanted Ekblad as the coordinator on the PP1 and has just been outstanding coming out of nowhere for a 70 point season
Almost.  Alex Lyon is doing his part now, too.
I still wonder to this day how epic tkachuk would’ve been with mcdavid if they selected him over puljujarvi
Did I miss something or is this just a random shit post?
You literally responded though
The committee likes players who “single-handedly” lifts their teams to another level. Stars have Benn and Heiskanen who are also good.
Since July 2007 for sure
I don't understand how anyone could not love Tage! He's fuckin dynamic af and is almost single handedly pumping life back into the Sabres and giving their fans something to get excited about! Plus the rest of the league getting to watch someone explode onto the scene is always really cool
Yeah dude you’re right EK should have retired. /s
It wouldn’t. They’re still tied up with garbage contracts like Vlasic. Bedard in SJ would be Bedard wasted.
Drai would be there. 123 points, 15 above the next highest. If you take out McDavid he clearly is the winner
It's been the same with Malkin standing in Crosby's shadow.  I root for Drai partly because of this... Being like the second best center in the league but clearly the second best center on the team is tough.
It's insane. He is such a special player.
What a fucking ride that would be with his early career struggles. Accolades and trophies notwithstanding it's been fantastic watching him adapt to the NHL and have fun finding that success :)
Subscribe
Ok fine. MacKinnon. Happy now?
One of those feel good stories, I am sure. How many saves did he make last night? 4000?
Feel like Tkachuk would be so underrated if he played with McDavid
Don't forget Hintz! Or Pavelski! Or Lindell!  I don't think anyone reaches their best without the team to be fair. Robertson does score a lot of solo effort goals though. Broke Modano's franchise points record too. He doesn't have the typical superstar makeup without godly speed though, which to me makes his success almost more impressive.  I honestly don't care too much about awards. As long as Robo's having fun I'm happy :)
I think what he’s trying to say is that right now it’s more important for the Sharks to lose games to better their chances at drafting a young difference maker over the individual (and it has been quite individual) success of Erik Karlsson.   Good on Karlsson for having a hell of a year but the Sharks need Bedard or any of the other top 3 players more than that.
It's really just Vlasic and Labanc. And we can buy out Vlasic whilst Labanc still contributes around 20 Goals.  We've got a good young core too, so no. He probably wouldn't be wasted.
Yea I didn’t include him in this scenario. If he had 123 points without Mcdavid he’d win, but without Mcdavid he wouldn’t have that many points. He’d probably be around 105 or so with the other top guys.
If you take out McDavid he doesn’t have 123 points lol
I like Drai’s game alot, he almost literally couldnt skate in the WCF last year but was still just turreting the puck where it needed to go. But if we were building a team and need a center (and McJesus isnt available) I think id rather have a more dynamic scorer like Mackinnon or a better shooter like Matthews. If they were the same age Id prolly even take a defensive star like Bergeron.   Id be curious once its said and done who has the better “in the shadow” career, Drai or Malkin.
56 saves last night. I think it's a franchise record for regulation saves since Luongo's 57 was partly OT saves.  In his past 5 games he's let in 7 goals on 179 shots.  Also our defense let in 58 shots last night, so there's that. But that game was more about fighting than playing anyway.
oh you would 100% hear people saying "tkachuk is only good because he's playing with mcdavid"
The 3-game win streak was great for team morale and gave some rookie call-ups quality NHL minutes, but has basically locked the Sharks into 29th place.  Even if they lose their remaining four games, I don't believe Chicago (vs SEA, MIN, PIT, PHI), Columbus (NYR, PHI, PIT, BUF), nor Anaheim (ARI, COL, VAN, LAK) will each gain 4+ points in the standings to surpass them.  The optimist in me is hoping they win the lottery and draft Bedard, or at least move up a few spots for Fantilli.
Maybe but if you use that logic Connor doesn't have as many points without Drai, Pasta shouldn't be considered because he is surrounded by the best overall team, etc.
So only players on shitty teams can have MVPs?
I mean everyone has their personal favorites for sure, as a non partial observer it's just my opinion on that. I don't know if there's a perfect answer on who is the second best. But out of those only Matthews have won a Lindsay, Hart and Art Ross like Drai has. Bergeron is a more complete player for sure. I know Mac just won the cup but that's a team thing and he didn't win the conn Smythe.   Malkin has another Art Ross, a Conn Smythe and a Calder on Drai, so he has a little catching up to do.
Drai has about a 3% higher career shooting percentage than Matthews. The man can shoot and score as well as any player in the league.
Literally every player on the Oilers get that lol
Good point. Pasta I do struggle with a bit because Boston would still be a wagon without him.   I agree with your point so I’ll say Drai, Tkachuk and Rantanen  as my 3 without Mcdavid,
>Pasta shouldn't be considered because he is surrounded by the best overall team, etc.  Playing in second line with Zacha and Bertuzzi ? Having twice as many points as anyone in the first line ?  You know why McDavid or Drai have more points than anyone else ? Because their PP unit is the best in the league
Literally didn’t say that but to pretend like a player’s team doesn’t impact their performance is stupid too.
Heres a fun way to look at it: if both Mackinnon and Draisaitl were on the SAME team, who would have more points? Im not sure which way it would go lol.
Do you know why the Oilers PP is the best in the league…?
McDavid wouldn't have as many points as he does without Drai. McKinnon wouldn't have as many points without Mikko. It is pointless to just remove good teammates because you can make that argument with every top player
Because it’s the HUGEST?
Because they have best and most productive players in that unit ? Hence reacting to:  >Pasta shouldn't be considered because he is surrounded by the best overall team, etc.  If Pasta production largely comes from playing with not as productive teammates, then why it should be taken as negative for rating Pastrnak MVP ?
That’s ridiculous.  Some players have better or worse supporting casts. If you can’t figure out who does then that’s on you. Stop playing dumb.
Id say thats true for the most part, thats why its impressive how well Rants has played without Landeskog all season, and Mack, Makar, Lehky, and Nuke all missed a bunch of games. We  havent seen Mcdavid miss any significant time recently so its hard to say how well Drai would play without him, probably still 100 player tho.
They have big PP energy for sure
I made no comments about Pastrnak’s game and have no criticisms for him whatsoever. I am strictly responding to:  >	You know why McDavid or Drai have more points than anyone else ? Because their PP unit is the best in the league  Why should McDavid and Draisaitl take a negative hit for being the best players on the best power play in NHL history? Do you think maybe it’s so good because they are the best and one of the best players in the league? The power play benefits from having them on it more than they benefit from being on the power play.
My whole point is that good teammates shouldn't be held against players like Drai and Pasta. Also, why are you acting like Drai is always a first liner. A lot of this year he was on the 2nd line that was missing Kane
Mack played 66 of 78 games. He didn't miss half the season or anything.   We have seen Drai play a lot of minutes with McDavid off the ice
Does it matter how much time they play together 5on5 if the major reason for their gaudy numbers is on the PP where they are always together?

damn no games today  i know it's a holiday but still  separate church and skate
Why the fuck is there no hockey today
Anyone know if there’s a particular reason there aren’t any games scheduled today?
Heey! Im very very new to hockey and I was wondering if anyone could tell me how drafting to the NHL works? Because I saw that, for example, a couple sophomores from the Umich hockey team were drafted and I was wondering if they will enter the NHL next year or if they’ll finish university first? It’s a bit of a stupid question but I’m not from North America so I’m unfamiliar with the concept of drafting. Thank you in advance :))
Can anyone explain how Windsor got swept by Kitchener
Defense in the game of hockey is such a badly defined aspect. Offense for comparison would be every action that results in goals being produced. Goals and assists then become very natural stats that predict if a player is good at offense.   For Defense however, the definition would probably be every action that prevents goals against. The problem is when you don't have a clear-cut stat that accurately predicts these actions for individuals. I guess someone realised that we need soke kind of "easy-to-understand" stat to look at so +/- was invented. The problem with that stat, as everyone who's ever thought about it realised, is that it is in no way an individual stat. It tells a story of how the team performed over in an instance.   If people are going to start actually discussing best defensive players, I hope they realise that the quantifiable actions are very indirectly related to what people mean by defense and present stronger arguments thatn"hE's A pLuS pLaYeR tHiS yEaR"
One of the few days of the regular season where I know the standings in the sidebar are actually up to date and including all played games!
Wait is that why there’s no games today? That’s ridiculous
I dunno if this would be an actual reason, but it's pretty cool to have all 32 teams play tomorrow all with a day off before. And right near the end of the season too.
It’s a holiday, at least in Canada.
College draftees get to decide if they’re going to finish their last year of college or leave to go pro. It feels like most players decide to stay and get their degree, but it’s definitely not super unusual for them to join the pro team right away.  If a player does choose to stay in college they technically haven’t signed their pro contract yet, which means they can technically choose not to sign with the team that drafted them and let their rights expire in which case they become a free agent. That’s what happened with Jimmy Vesey and the Preds.
I'll use this page to answer dinner questions: https://www.nhl.com/bluejackets/news/nhl-draft-101-rules-and-information/c-675546    Any North American between 18 and 20 years old who wants to join the NHL must join via the draft. After they turn 20, they are considered a UFA and can sign with any team. When a player is drafted by a team, that team holds the rights to that player for two years meaning only that team can sign the player and can do so at any point during that two year span. If that player is still 20 when their rights expire, they can re-enter the draft and get selected again, even by the same team.   For players who come up through the juniors, they usually develop early and want to enter the NHL as soon as possible because there is no reason to stay in the juniors. (Think of juniors like an apprenticeship.)    For players who come up through college, they typically are slower to develop and may want extra time to work on their game while working on an education. Also, when a player signs a contract they become a professional player and are no longer eligible to play in the NCAA, the college sports league, which means that they'll wait until the end of college hockey season to sign, whereas players in juniors don't have that restriction.
I mean you can use advanced stats instead of +/-, the technology is there lmao. "Defense is such a badly defined aspect, but im only going to use the worst stat to define that aspect" is basically the point youre making here.
We'll call it Puckapalooza
> but it's pretty cool to have all 32 teams play tomorrow  WHAT?! Eeeeeeeee!!!!
Do you guys celebrate Easter Sunday much?  In the U.S., Easter seems to take precedence over Good Friday as a holiday.
Good Friday in the US as well, not a bank holiday but still a holiday.
I make that point because it seems like a large portion of discussion around defensive prowess circle around +/-. I agree that the technology to rate defense is there, but it's much harder to get an overview when each team play different styles of defense which would lead to different stats.  Case in point: the Islanders undrr Trotz played great defensive hockey but most players still ended up with pretty bad advanced stats.
Good Friday is a thing, and then Easter Monday is less so but that's my birthday so it's a day off for me
Yeah but they have games on Easter so I didn’t think Good Friday would warrant it more.
Not a bank holiday? It's one of the reddest days in the year where I live, as red as Dec 25th.
Thats a fair point, might just be how the schedule worked out but it is weird to have no games on a Friday.
I know in Mexico, Easter's not really a big deal compared to the rest of Holy Week, especially Good Friday.  Canada may also be more focused on Good Friday.
I don't know what you mean by red but yeah businesses are still open today, its not a bank holiday.
Hopefully Good Friday falls on Monday next year
You could tell me that Hughes, Makar, Heiskanen, and Dahlin are all 14 years old and I'd believe you.
Heiskanen still somehow only 23
i just want miro to be close to the top in a finalist position. I know he probably won’t win but what he’s doing by himself is amazing to watch
Heiskanen cause I put money on it before the season.   Seriously it has to be Karlsson though, points aren't everything but the gap between him and everyone else is too big to ignore.
Dahlin fell off after the all star break due to injuries which is a bummer
Hamilton's been having an underrated season.
Nice
100% should be Karlsson and I would add that cap hit is totally irrelevant in the Norris discussion lol  Edit: Seeing a lot of the typical arguments about the Norris so I wanted to add a little more to this comment.  Defense does (and should) matter in these trophy discussions. Karlsson is verifiably bad defensively but that shouldn’t automatically exclude him from the Norris when his offense is so fucking dominant. If we are considering everything each defenseman provides, both offensively and defensively, I don’t see how Karlsson isn’t the favorite. He isn’t the runaway/unanimous favorite like his point production would imply because his defense is so horrid but I personally think overall he is the clear best choice, by whatever subjective margin that may be.  Similar to Makar/Josi last year, if someone like Fox would have been able to close the offensive gap to within 5-10 points, I think his vastly superior defense tips the scales in his favor but no one has been able to do that this year. Karlsson just ascended to a different planet, he’s literally one of the top offensive players in the entire league, not just for defenseman, and is undoubtedly a top three playmaker in the entire league this year. He’s unreal.
Karlsson deserves an award of some sort.  It'll probably be the Norris, but how about the Shutting People Up Award?  I know he's shut me up for sure.  I never thought in a million years he'd have a season like this at 32.  Good for him.
Karlsson HAS to win it yeah? He’s about to be the first dman in like 30 years to score 100 points in a season.
Been getting a ton of shit from Bruins fans for thinking this, because Jack Edwards has gone on some anti-EK for Norris tirades, but Karlsson should absolutely win the Norris. I typically get annoyed when the award just goes to the highest scorer, but his numbers this year are just undeniable. Probably gonna be the first D to break 100 points in 30 years. Aka, not an era when an 880 sv% is considered average. On the 22-23 Sharks. Could be one of three defensemen along with Orr and Coffey to score 103 or more points. Whatever you think of his defense, which, don’t get me wrong, is not good, it is nowhere near bad enough to negate this historic offensive season
You know what I realized just now? Dougie Hamilton and Adam Fox are all chin. Like 100% chin. Wouldn't want to be underneath either of them when they sneeze, you know what I mean?
Karlsson
Hampus Lindholm should be a finalist at least, he's been the best defenceman at actually playing defence since the start while also potting 51 points.
Karlsson with -16 on a trash team is impressive imo. He’s also top 10 in the league in takeaways. Slavin and Fox are the only other defenders on that list.  Edit: hard working trash team (unfortunately).
Updated the graphic to clean it up a bit, also added Brandon Montour and Vince Dunn for those asking about them.  Upvotes on this comment so more people see it would be helpful.  https://imgur.com/a/VnSOzhZ
I love how Karlsson looks like he spends his off days tying damsels across train tracks.
why is Makar on here? Not gonna have near enough games played
Worth mentioning: Erik Karlsson has scored the same number of even-strength goals as Leon Draisaitl.
It’s gotta be Karlsson, but I didn’t realize how many other D men were having great years. Especially Dougie Hamilton.
EK, but I don’t think Vince Dunn is getting enough appreciation: dude’s been an absolute stud for us
Karlsson and the only debate is who should finish 2nd.
Books have priced Karlsson in for 2 months now
Erik Karlsson
If EK was in 80s for points, we would have a discussion. Hard to give it to a guy who gets a few more points on an absolute shit team.  He will be high 90s or cross 100. It is his even though his defense is weaker conoared to other high scoring defensemen in race.Essentially he is just too far ahead in offense to give it to anyone else.
Criminal that lindholm isn't on this list
Its got to be EKs
Karlsson with Hamilton as runner up
DARNELL NURSE afk
You mean the trophy awarded for "defense player who demonstrates throughout the season the greatest **all-round ability** in the position", but we're not considering actual defensive stats at all.  Makes sense.
If Makar wasn’t ~~lost in Costco~~ injured all season I swear.   Karlsson gonna get it probably.
Fox and Hamilton the most consistent top to bottom of the table.
I honesty dont know who deserves it most, but Karlssons gunna win
Josh Morrissey is the Norris winner of my heart
I get so unreasonably annoyed with people who argue Karlsson shouldn't win it because of "bad defense". He is playing on one of the worst defensive teams this year and still posts better expected goals against than e.g. Morresey. He is also in the 100% percentile in both offense and transition in all of the sites who track stats like that. There hasn't been a defenseman doing what Karlsson is doing for 30 years.   Also, defense is such a loosely defined aspect of hockey. It's immensely more difficult to track for individuals that offense. +/- which people still use in 2023 may be the single worst stat in all of sports for rating individual players. Of course Hampus Lindholm is going to be a +50 player if he logs minutes on one of the best teams in the NHL. Likewise is every single player going to be a negative player on a bad team. It could paint a picture for certain lines and pairings but in no way does it say much for individuals.
The fact that Karlsson leads points by so much but isn’t anywhere near the top of powerplay points is crazy. When was the last time a defenseman was so deadly at 5 on 5?
Ah yes. A list of mostly offensive stats to decide the best defenseman.   Fuck that!!   Anyone else tire of the Norris being the Art Ross for Defenseman?
Karlsson. I’m torn between him and Fox on who should win.
Karlsson  Hamilton   Fox
Dang looking at this table makes me think Hamilton and Heiskanen should be front runners. Don't know if I would've picked either of them.   Personally I'd pick Karlsson for the Hart before I picked him for the Norris. (Not that I'd pick him before McDavid, just that he seems to exemplify more of what the Hart represents then the Norris - he hasn't been great as a defenseman, but as a hockey player he seems to contribute far and away more to his team relative to his team than most other players in the league could say)  Happy to see Quinn getting some respect and surprised that his defensive numbers are on par with his offense.
I think Karlson should win but my boy Hughes doesn't get enough love. Second in points as it stands with a plus 15.   Don't forget he plays for Vancouver.
fox is the best all around defensemen in the league but it’ll be karlsson
Gotta be Karlsson because 100 points for a defenceman is ridiculous but he’s definitely not the best “defender”
Nice
Karlsson, but Heiskanen should be a nominee along with Makar.
Heiskanen, they want the best D who makes the playoffs.
had no idea how good Dougie’s xGA stats were compared to the other top offensive producers in the league. You hear everyone say that Fox is head and shoulders above everyone else in the conference and I’m not so sure that’s fair.
Look it’s Karlsson but the real talking point is that you should be laughed out of the room for leaving Hampus Lindholm off the graphic
karlsson has more assists than anyone else as has total points….i’ve always believed him to be the best defenceman in the league so i’m on team karlsson.
If scoring starts were closer then it wouldn't be Karlsson.  But it's not close. He'll have 100+ points by the end of the seasons and pretty much drives his entire teams offense.  The other candidates are on much better teams with much better teammates.
Very nice graphic
I feel like Karlsson not getting traded at the deadline to Edmonton robbed hockey fans across the world of something special. This was the year I officially started despising the salary cap.
Nice
Quinn is on one of the worst teams in the league and has a +15
If Karlsson wins he will be the highest paid player ever to win the Norris.
It's 100% going to be EK65. Should it be? Not really, but he's going to win
Karlsson will win it. Even though he is not a top 10 defenseman. The Norris is all about the points.
Blocks and hits don’t mean anything?
There should be a statistic in which this and many other awards should be based on… oh wait there Are, but the voters don’t give a rip.
Karlsson will win, because I suspect enough voters will be swayed by a historic offensive season for a defenseman, even while on a bad team nowhere near the playoffs, with suspect defensive metrics relative to the other top players.  The other thing that works in his favour is there is no consensus around the who is the best all around defender this year, as this graphic shows a ton of excellent seasons, who will likely split the non-Karlsson vote among those who vote other players ahead of him.
EK65 on verge of first 100pt D-man season in 30 years and this is supposed to be a debate?
With the lead in points that Karlsson has it’s a no contest. If he were only leading by a few points then they’d factor in the +/- but as it is, discussion over.
Karlsson probably wins although I think it should be Fox or Morrisey.
I find this graph’s lack of Hampus disturbing.
Part of me wants it to be Karlsson. Just for the story and the comeback year he’s had offensively. At the same time, I know that he sucks defensively so logically he shouldn’t win and also everyone would never shut up about how he didn’t deserve it. I don’t actually think he should but it’s what I wish would happen.  I hope he continues to be this good offensively next year but is traded to a different better team so that his defensive dumpster fire is covered up more.
How is Brandon montour not on here?
Hopefully the people who actually vote on these awards know what they’re doing. Idk how you can give the Norris to someone who pretty pathetic in their own end.
Gonna have to say dougie Hamilton gets it, 2nd best +/-, lowest GA/60 shows he's been sound both offensively and defensively.
Fox , makar and karlsson, karlsson is the more offenssif, but i feel like fox and makar should have an advantage for their +/- and the impact they had on their team
Karlsson with the most points and least PP points is very impressive.
Karlsson should and will win it.
Karlsson
Karlsson
I think Karlsson’s numbers are undeniable here. It’s almost too bad because if you exclude him, it would be a really tight race this year
The fact EK is the old head here and is 5 years my junior makes me feel so old.    Give it to the old man!
EK65. Followed by Hamilton, then Fox.
It should be Adam Fox. His stats and advanced stats all back it up
Karlsson, Fox, Lindholm are my top 3.
The fact that Dougie will likely hardly even be mentioned in the actual voting is a crime
Karlsson, Makar, Fox.
Karlsson will win it based on offense alone. If it were for actually being good at playing defense someone else would win it.
McAvoy not being on this list just means that availability is the best kind of ability.  He missed the first few months of the season, but I think he's the best 2 way defenseman in the league, and probably overall best defenseman behind only Makar.
Karlson. Not because of his points. Just the facial hair. But Hamilton looks like the best on ice performance. Good D and good O.
Morrissey and Karlsson are out based on plus/minus for me. Makar is out for not playing enough games. Without having watched any of them play enough games really, I'd give it to Hughes based solely off numbers.
Give it to the old man
I’m feeling Dougie or Karlsson
Give it to EK, great comeback year for this man!
Even though it moves him past Keith for career Norris trophies, it has to be Karlsson.  His highlight reel for this season is about 3 hours long
I tend to lean toward guys on playoff teams, but it's hard to argue against Karlsson. A case could be made for Makar despite the missed games, he's that good, and Heiskanen, Fox and Hamilton have all had excellent seasons on quality playoff teams. I wouldn't have a problem with any of those 5, and it sure makes the voting for the two all-star teams pretty interesting.  Lindholm from the Bruins is someone who's caught my eye from a defensive standpoint, extremely underrated.
Who plays the most TOI for the Bruins?  I vote for that guy.
MIRO! But I'm extremely biased
I'm not an advocate for always giving it to the top scoring d-man, but how could it not be Karlsson? If you're putting up 100+ points & finishing nearly 30 ahead of the next guy it really doesn't matter how you play in your own end
I'm a fan of Hampus Lindholm.   I'll be he gets the 1st place vote from Boston voter(s); and he gets 3rd & 4th place from many others.  I'm not a fan of Karlsson getting it. He's defense does not warrant it.
you're smoking something laced if Lindholm isn't even in the conversation
Call me a homer but no Lindholm nor McAvoy is a snub.
If Makar didn't miss 17+ games, he wins easily. Since he did, though, my heart is with Quinn. I feel how good he's been this year has gotten overshadowed so much by how much if a disaster the Canucks have been... unfortunately it will probably be  Karlsson who wins the vote despite him just being a 4th forward and not really a defenseman.
This is the most underwhelming Norris class I've seen in a long time.  Karlsson gets it because of the sheer points totals, but he's basically a 4th forward out there, and 99% of their total offensive output.  There's a reason they're one of the worst teams in the league, and his lack of defensive skills are part of that.  That said, its hard to argue with a 100 point season, even if you are minus double digits.
Nice
If Karlsson wins, that’s further proof that Josi got absolutely fucked out of the award last year
It's Karlsson because the Norris has turned into the best offensive defenseman
I know +/- is a very flawed stat but Karlsson being a -16 with 73 even strength points is insane for someone in the ‘best defenseman’ conversation
AKSHUALLY Brandon Montour has the most single season assists by a defenceman so he has my vote ☝️🤓
Karlsson because the award has turned into the defenceman’s version of the selke. It just goes to the best offensive defenceman
Lol @ no Lindholm love
The Norris is just the Art Ross for defensemen.
Seth Jones
No canes players up there so this is a joke
Well Karlsson is having a historic year for any defenseman, so... Cale Makar?
I think Karlsson might have it but it makes me so mad! If you watched his games, he has zero involvement in defense, individually or team D. EK only thinks about EK. It makes me mad because there are plenty of good defensemen that are good for their team and sacrifice themselves while offering good offense but their numbers don’t match EK. Stats don’t tell the whole story for D-men.
This is why I feel like we should have two seperate awards for top scoring d man and best d man defensively
I believe there should be an award for the best offensive defenseman and a separate one for best defensive defensemen. We do it for forwards and it's not like they are incapable of having a defensive game.  In the spirit of that, it's Karlsson's until the league addresses what the award actually rewards...
If Josi didn’t win with a 96 point regular season on a better team (Makar deserved it and was obviously the best d man last year) I feel like we shouldn’t be surprised if EK doesn’t win. The thing is there isn’t another super obvious choice but I hope he does though because I really thought his career was over
dougie
The guy with the most points, so EK
EK65 should be recognized as the best and most valuable player on his team BY FAR and doing it as a defenseman.  This is the exciting attack NHL style we love to watch.  Promote it.
Karlsson, Hamilton, Fox, Heiskanen, Morrisey, Hughes, Makar, Dahlin in that order. Dahlin and Makar couldn't stay healthy and shouldn't be top 5 in votes
Man if only Cale didn’t miss a good chunk of games… he’s absolutely the best in the game. I still would give him my 1st place vote if I had one, but I don’t think he’ll win because of the time missed  Karlsson because of his points I assume will win… but I think it should be Dougie (I’ve unfortunately witnessed him brutalize my team so yknow lol)  Heiskanen is unreal though too, I love him/Hughes/Dahlin - all young studs. Would kill for any one of these guys alongside Letang… pain lol
The thing hurting Karlsson the most is his +/-. I know he’s on the sharks but -16 is not good
Karlsson will win it but he definitely shouldn't. His offensive numbers are boosted because he can play however he wants when he's on the ice. He doesn't have to play any defence because it's not like the Sharka are trying to win games or anything. I'm fine with giving the award to a guy who is proficient in the offensive zone but there still has to be at least some defensive capability in that players game. Karlsson would not be having the offensive season he is having this year if he was playing for a team that was trying to win.
Usually has nothing to do with defense right? Whoever has the most points usually wins?
Soon we will give vezina to goalie who makes most points.
If it wasn’t for Karlsson scoring a ridiculous amount of points I think Hamilton would be the clear winner, followed by Fox.   I would love to give EK some type of like “comeback player” award for this season and have Hamilton, Fox, and like Morrissey battle out the Norris voting but that won’t happen lol
One of the tightest races for Norris I think I've ever seen. Dougie or Miro would be my first two picks, followed by Erik.
Karlsson winning the Norris would be a farce. The guy does not give a fuck about playing defense
Dougie is the man
Lindholm deserves to be on this list. His 51 points in 76 games is still very solid, but more importantly is that his defensive game is better than any other player listed here. His positioning, gap control, transitional passing, and incredibly smart pinches don't show up on score sheets but are very apparent when you watch him. He is a student of Scott Niedermayer from his time at Anaheim, and it really shows. He doesn't have the raw skill as some of the guys here, but his defensive IQ would be the highest.  If I was protecting a lead, needed to kill a penalty, or needed to pick a defenseman for an important defensive zone start, I'd pick Lindholm before any of the guys on your post.
It's Karlsson, Fox, Makar for me, in that order.  Honorable mentions to Vince Dunn, Jaccob Slavin, Jared Spurgeon, Hampus Lindholm, Brent Burns, Charlie McAvoy, Jonas Brodin, Adam Pelech, Jonas Siegenthaler, Mattias Ekholm, Roman Josi, Brandon Montour, Mikhail Sergachev, Mark Giordano, Jusso Valimaki, Rasmus Andersson, Brady Skjei, T.J. Brodie, Noah Hanifin and Drew Doughty for all also having great seasons.
I don't think most points should be the determining factor for best d-man, it should be "best at defending" first.   Seems like that's rarely the #1 factor though.
I just want my boy Morrissey to win it. One of the rare, better stories coming out of the Jets this year.
After Karlsson who 100% deserves and should win it, this table tells me Dougie is having a helluva season. Points total, XGF and XGA are all very impressive.
Erik Karlsson
Karlsson and it isn’t close
EK. That is all.
Dahlin is a bargain at 6 million, having a good season.
Ek65
If Karlsson doesn’t win I’m going to be very upset because it is quite literally the only highlight of our season. Can’t even highlight the worst record because he keeps getting points to win us games
EK65 for the vibes is good enough for me
EK
Erik Karlsson or Dougie Hamilton
Althought pts arent everything the fact that Karlsson is almost even strength points per game is ridiculous. He has the most points (by far) and least of them being powerplay out of everyone there
It should be Karlsson. He’s literally the only reason this dogshit team can score (besides Meier pre-trade)
Karlsson
Karlsson
Gotta be Karlsson
Karlsson should win it just for that mustache. Maybe the NHL needs a new trophy for Best Facial Hair.
If Karlsson hits a 100 points, he's a surefire lock.  He's already the bookies' favorite by a wide margin.
I think ek65. he’s been scoring like crazy, and has been a consistently good defenseman this year as well as goals
At this point if karlsson doesn’t this league is a joke.  There’s really no argument.
Wish I could say or give you my honest opinion, but I cannot. I’ve barely watched any games this year since I never renewed my VPN. The blackouts are getting out of hand. Illegal streaming is seriously the best option. I don’t understand how the NHL thinks they’re growing an audience. Hockey is the only sport I freaking care about and I don’t even have the time or energy to figure out how the hell to find/watch a freaking game. WHEW I needed to get that out.   Ughhh Erik Karlsson??? Only because it seems like a comeback year and I remember him a few years back.
Karlsson and it's not close imo. He is just so astronomically outpacing the field AND HIS TEAM offensively, and it's completely unexpected, in his mid-30s on a shit team AND most of his points are fucking even strength for Pete's sake (idk if he's leading the league at even strength but was at one point which is ludicrous).  Sure, his defense ain't great, but surely that is made worse by the shit team he is on. Like I am astounded his plus/minus isn't much worse. Heck, look at the rest of the shakes roster and they're competing for the masters with heavy minus.  The dude has been absolutely unreal, it's a snub if he doesn't win.
It's Karlsson and it's not even close, he's on the worst team producing the most by like 20% on the next closest.  Top 15 in scoring for a defenseman(season) all time, like bruh
I gotta say Makar, since he's our boy.  But Karlson stands to hit a century.  That's goddamn huge.
EK65 w/o a doubt. Next
Being a plus 15 on a dumpster fire team is pretty impressive honestly.
I think Erik Karlsson deserves it. He’s the only interesting player on the SJ Sharks at this point. Yes his defensive game isn’t always super strong but 75 assist with that team is impressive.
Karlsson for sure
the one who has more even strength points than mcdavid.
100 points is dominant offence in even from a top line forward. My vote would be for Karlsson and I’d be pumped to see him win it.
Dougie Hamilton by a landslide.  Karlsson wins the first annual Erik Karlsson award for best offensive defensemen. If you don’t want to call it the Bobby Orr award.
Dougie or Miro ? I’m gonna say dougie cause I’m a devils fan
As long as it isn’t Karlsson I’m fine with anybody. I’ll take Morrissey, Fox, Makar, Heiskanen. Any order.
The lack of Vince Dunn respect, smh
Someone who isn't -16.
Plus minus should play a bigger role here. If you are a minus… you are not the leagues best defenseman, you are just the fourth forward.
Feel bad for Dougie he would definitely win it this year if it wasn’t for karlsson absolutely poping off
Very off topic, but it's going to be nice to factor into the awards this year. We're likely going to have significant votes or even finalists for the Norris (Hamilton), Hart (Hughes), and Selke (Hischier) and possibly the front-runner for the Byng (Hughes).
Karlsson but I really like Hamilton and Fox this year. Makar is the best all around dman in the game IMO but too many injuries this season
Karlsson, but shoutout to Montour
Hamilton is the only real challenger for Karlsson IMO. As much as I don’t think you should just give it to the guy with the most points, it’s different when that guy is 25 points ahead of the next closest guy.
How is this competitive, Makar has these stats with ~15 games less than the rest. It's going to be a surprise if anyone takes it from him this decade.  /edit I'm mostly homer joking.
Probably Fox because he plays for the Rags.
Karlsson should win it,  but I have a feeling that Makar will win it because popularity, and because he won it over Josi last year who had the best point total last year and the best defensive year since Borque.
Karlsson is out because the shit heads that vote consider "making the playoffs" their number 1 criteria.     Probably Hamilton because he's in the East.
Looking for unbiased opinions here - how does Lindholm stack up with these guys? He’s been super impressive to watch pretty consistently this year
dougie criminally underrated season
Dougie!!
The disrespect being shown to Martin Marincin is astounding.
I love the layout of the graphic. Intuitive and easy to read, the headshots are a nice touch too!
foxyclean
I miss Dougie :(
I don’t watch a lot of Erik play, so I’m asking, not telling, help me out  Is Karlsson bad in his own zone?  I see him pinch, take chances and jump in plays a lot. When he stays at home is he a liability? Or is his suspect d just part of his always trying to offensive chances and being up in play?
What about Montour??
Now do the Selke.
Gotta be Karlsson, what a renaissance
I will continue to spout this until he gets a trophy but - Jonas Brodin deserves a trophy.
Plus minus is the most important stat here
If it’s not Jalen Chatfield, I riot.
🦊
Connor Murphy. To only be -9 on defense on possibly the worst hockey team I have ever seen assembled in the salary cap era has to be Norris worthy.
It really should be Karlsson but I'm scared that voters will either say he's not good enough defensively or he doesn't deserve it because his team sucks
Gotta think it comes down to Karlsson Fox and Morrissey. Although I think if EK hits 100 points it would be hard to not give it to him even though his team is terrible
Karlsson’s picture should put him over the top.
Lol might want to put Hampus Lindholm on this list.
Nice
I want to say Fox because he seems the most consistent top to bottom, but it's hard to ignore that Karlsson has a lot more points on a much worse team who undoubtedly make his life and stats hard to sustain.
Dougieeeee
I know they’re lacking points compared to everyone else here, but McAvoy and Lindholm deserve to be in the discussion. McAvoy has 50 points in 64 games with a +28, with 3.8GF/60 and 2.1GA/60.   Lindholm has 51 points in 76 games with a +46, 3.9GF/60 and 2.1GA/60  Personally I’ve never seen the Norris as being about the points, but how dominant and impactful you are at both ends of the ice
EK65 for the WIN!
I would like to see Karlson the loan bright spot on a dismal season 🏒🏒🏒
WPG "fringe playoffs" ouch
And Hampus Lindholm isn’t even in the discussion.
Karlsson. Come up with a new trophy for actual defensive value.
should be erik but i feel vince dunn has flown under the radar a bit.
Heart says Morrissey. Head says Makar.
Chuck Norris does he always wins
The original…Chuck
LINDHOLM.      that is all.  thank you have a nice evening
Im personally pulling for Dahlin, but I wouldnt be mad at any of the candidates.
Makar was making a push but all the games missed in the last month have taken it out of it. Karlsson 100%
Chuck Norris
What if Luke Hughes gets 46 points in the remaining three games left in the season? Would he be on the ballot?
Erik Norris
Wild that Calgary is connected to 4 of these players
I’m honestly curious about Dougie Hamilton. Wasn’t there a team that started rumours about him that he’s a little different (ie he preferred going to museums than team functions)? What other dirt is there?
No way Karlsson becomes the first defenseman in 30 years to get 100+ pts and not get the Norris.
EK65 one last time into a golden sunset ppc
EK65 for 100+ points in a season.  First defenceman in many years.  He'll likely finish with the second most points a Shark ever had!
I’m giving it to Douglas.
Jonas Brodin
Weber
I want Hughes, just because I'm a Canucks fan and he has been fantastic all around for the team this year. But reality, i think Karlsson.
Vince dunn
Seider
As an Avalanche fan, my answer has to be....Karlsson.  His defense is suspect at times, but to put up those numbers on that team is impressive.
Makar had it but then he kept getting injured. Then I would have said Morrisey but his production slowed down. Karlsson is probably going to win it. He's MVP on his team.
Montour wouldn't win but he's had a great season. In my opinion he's playing better hockey right now than Dahlin. Dahlin looks lost and Montour is helping his team push for the playoffs. Montour > Dahlin
I'd go with Hamilton personally. Makar and Karlsson would be next for me.  As a Canucks fan I like the nod to Hughes, he's had a good season in a defensive clusterfuck of a team, but yeah, not Norris worthy.
Heiskanen with a larger % of his points from the PP than Dahlin.
It has to be Karlsson, he’s going to single-handedly lose Bedard for San Jose.
I think only 3 out of these 8 are actual contenders for it - Dougie, Karlsson and Makar
Lidstrom
I think that +15 for Hughes on Vancouver really pops.   But it's Karlsson.
This isn’t even a question.
If offensive is the top determinate factor (which seems weird for a trophy for best D) obviously EK65.   Best 2-way Defensemen is Fox and Makar but 60 games just isn’t enough so Fox.
That 14 year old is probably going to be our next captain. Ceremonial faceoffs involving us are going to look like father and son.
Morrissey also looks 14, but with a painted on beard
Dudes been 23 for 3 years
I’m more surprised Adam Fox is the same age as Makar.
I just saw Heiskanens point totals and was blown away, he must’ve had an amazing end of the season!   Imo defensively he’s been one of the best young d-men for a while now, but this year he’s only clearly outpaced points wise by Karlsson and Makar, of all D-men in the league! Incredible player and should be top 3 for Norris IMO.
Miro has elevated his game to a new level recently and I love it. He is an absolute gem to watch
I think he'll win a Norris or two at some point in his career, he's one he'll of a young D man for you guys
Heiskanen because he's on my team.  Not Karlsson because he didn't score 10 goals against the Avs last night.  It's probably Karlsson though, so I'll settle for Miro winning the Hart trophy or whatever.
Also doing that on a crappy team is impressive (Karlsson)
I had put money on Heiskanen, and then Karlsson shortly after the season started. I should be happy either way :)
not to mention that xGF% is much better than I was expecting considering Karlsson's shitty defense rep
>Seriously it has to be Karlsson though, points aren't everything but the gap between him and everyone else is too big to ignore.  Yup. Points aren't everything, but he's going to hit 100 points and have a 25(ish) point lead on the 2nd place D man. The gap in points between him and 2nd place Hughes is larger than the gap between Hughes and 19th place Drew Doughty. Ridiculous. The 25 point gap is the same gap McDavid has on #2 Draisaitl.  Karlsson is tied for 9th in scoring league-wide and he's 3rd in assists. He's tied for 1st in even strength points.  Points aren't everything, but the amount he's put up are undeniable.
At minus 16? That’s horrible for an award of best defenseman.
Karlsson has nothing to show for he plays as a forward and other people have on his team have to play defense
Yeah he hasn’t been the offensive juggernaut since the concussion. Hopefully with a full offseason to recover and coming back to what should be an improved Sabres team leads him to a Norris next season!
He had half his total goals so far by game 11 and only 7 in the 62 games since.   Not knocking him (Hughes didn't score his first goal till the end of Dec lmao), more noting how hot he was to start the year.
I think Siegenthaler being so rock solid defensively next to him really unlocks Dougie's offensive creativity.  That and the Devils depth and speed up front.
He's been unreal. Breaking a lot of D records this year for the Devils which says a lot.
Imagin Calgary with Hamilton and Fox
I loved Hamilton on the hurricanes. Burns has been great but man it hurts letting dougie walk to a division competitor and do so well
I believe Hamilton faces easier competition than these other top guys, fwiw. I think Graves-Marino is NJD's primary shutdown pairing?
I think he should get the Norris over Karlsson. It’s not all points and Karlsson has a terrible +/-
That he has. Probably my number 4 this year.
How can you argue for anyone that doesn't have nice points?  It's clearly a 2 horse race.  The Finn or the Swede
Nice
For sure and a great point.   Interesting suggestion though: Gretzky recently wondered if there should be something like a “Bobby Orr” trophy for highest scoring defenseman to help emphasize that point and maybe allow the Norris Trophy to solely focus on defensive capabilities. I think I could get behind that idea
I put cap hit on the graphic more to show what a top defenseman in the NHL costs in 2023.  The spreadsheet settings from the other rows automatically added the color and I forgot to remove it.  I wasn't trying to push any narrative that cap hit affects the award, that's my bad.
Karlsson has a 53% gf% on a dogshit bad team    that alone gives him the Norris, especially when he's pushing 100 pts
I agree with pretty much everything but idk about “very bad” defensively. This season he’s been a little more “meh” defensively. But his offense is on such an insane level that it more than makes up for it
Isn’t Karlsson like 5th in the league in takeaways?
If EK scores 6 more points, he'll have had the 10th best single season ever by a defenseman in terms of offensive output, and the 9 seasons ahead of his would be literally just Orr and Coffey seasons. He'd be the third guy ever to put up 104+ points. We're watching history.
>Karlsson is verifiably bad defensively  While absolutely true and statistically supported, we can't pretend like it doesn't hurt his defensive metrics even further being on an absolutely horrid team, with horrid netminding, defense, and.... Everything lol.
He’s not “bad” defensively- he’s slightly below average at worst.  His relative gf% and xgf% is important - his team is bad and he has been brilliant
Norris is an offensive defensive award.
Anybody but Karlsson as he’s a defensive liability.
Karlsson is pretty bad defensively. He’s minus on the season and his team is trash. What’s the purpose of racking up all of those points if you’re not going to play solid defense?   Fox could put up pretty much same number of points as Karlsson, but it would be at the expense of defense. He’s also played a a chunk of the season without his D-partner and still holding it down with dudes who should be on the third pair or maybe even press box.
>I never thought in a million years he'd have a season like this at 32.  Good for him.  And you shouldn't have. No D man has *ever* had a season like this at 32 years old. He's at 98 points right now. No other D man has hit that number in a season after their 29th birthday. This is the best offensive season that a D man over 30 has ever had. And he's doing it on a team that doesn't have anyone else at the 70 point mark.  What he's doing is ludicrous. He's 16 points up on his previous career best that he hit at 25. Insane.
For the past 3 years I was saying "EK will pop off this year". Ahead of this season I finally started to doubt him, how foolish of me..
It sucks because this field def has some great names who could deserve a shot at it but you hit the nail on the head. 100 point defense dont happen often and he is doing it on a garbage team. That alone should tell you this 100 points is from him and not the classic "hes playing on a good team".
If he doesn’t it has to be one of the biggest snubs
I've seen a lot of hockey media members say that they would not vote for Karlsson because he's on a bad team/he's not good on defence. Sadly, they are the one who are voting, not the fans or the players. They usually give awards following a narrative they made, and this year, the narrative is Karlsson is only scoring points.  However, since they vote will be diluted a lot this year, I think he might win it, but it's gonna be close.
The meltdown over karlsson getting snubbed for a second time would be highly entertaining tho  But it's definitely his to lose
I mean this graphic shows he is above average defensively this year. That plus his points secures it in my mind. Also Avs just played the sharks back to back, when karlsson was not on the ice there was basically no fear the sharks would score. When he was they were a threat. They had 5 goals over those two games he had 4 points.
Edwards is a hack
MacInnis scored 103.
I've always noticed that about Fox, but this is the first time I've noticed Hamilton—it must be the beard.  Some people grow a beard to disguise their double chin, some people grow a beard to disguise their lack of chin, some people (Jay Leno) embrace their chin.
Agreed. Bostons missing piece. The biggest difference maker this season.
Charlie’s the better D and only a single point short.   They’ve both been very good, though Charlie has 12 fewer games.
I was shocked to not see him on here.  I thought I remember someone posting something a while back showing him and Grezlyck as the top shutdown pairing this year.
I agree because my 7 dollars would net me 1500 :)
I find it funny how this sub often talks about how the Norris tends to go to the Dman with highest offensive output like that's a negative, yet lots of folks in here saying it should go to Karlsson for that exact reason.
Absolutely no.
He is a +7 at 5v5, I’d like to know how many empty net goals he has been on the ice for.
Check out Hughes’ +15 on a separate trash team
And more even strength points than both Draisaitl and McDavid.
I'm a devils fan and If I'm being honest Dougie is amazing at scoring but probably average at D.  makes a lot of careless mistakes and often lacks tenacity
> If Makar wasn't ~~lost in Costco~~...  You ever got to Costco with a woman with grey hair in her 60s?  I'm not lost, but I sure as hell cannot find where the hell my mom is—because every other person is an older woman around 5'6 to 5'8 with medium length grey hair, and I can't pay for my shit because I need her membership card.  Sorry, I went to Costco with my mom yesterday and your comment triggered me.
If he played every game at the same pace, he'd still have 15 fewer points than Karlsson
Also played wayyyy to many minutes this year. Tough year for you guys. Good thing you just won the cup, I’m sure next season you guys will be a beast again
Why would Karlsson not deserve it most?
Its too bad the jets as a whole decided to stop playing after the all star break.  Morrissey would've been on a tear still if the team had kept an effort level of any substance.
+/- is a terrible standalone stat.  Breaking it down to individual situations (5v5, PP, PK, EN) provides needed context.  Off the top of my head, the most egregious situation is a player jumping on the ice during a change and logging 0:01 TOI prior to a goal being scored.
The last time a defenseman had more even strength points was in 1985. His 73 EVP is tied for 7th best all time among defensemen, if he finishes on a heater he could reach as high as 3rd all time (79 EVP). And when you consider the era of those other seasons it's even more impressive.
Exactly my thoughts as well. Kind of surprised reading the comments as well with people hyping Karlsson, yeah the offense is great but we are talking about a trophy given to the best defenseman. It's in the name, defense, of which Karlsson has none albeit he's playing with one leg.  But then again, offense is entertainment and NHL is entertainment business so with that in mind I also have to give the best odds for Karlsson, however much I dislike it. In my mind offense shouldn't come at the expense of defense, but good defense should enable good offense. Maybe having a separate award for the best offensive defenseman that could be given solely based on points which essentially is Norris at the moment, and Norris would be for the best overall?
So nice they memed it twice.
He’s on the updated graphic.  https://imgur.com/a/VnSOzhZ
Agreed. All-around excellence, which is what the award is for.
Karlsson seems like the obvious favorite.. But I know fox kills penalties and believe Lindholm does too. Does that count for anything? It should
Unfortunately we all know that playing the position correctly isn’t really considered when the Norris winner is selected.  That being said, I absolutely love Lindholm’s game.
Just wait until the playoffs you’ll see why
Makar missed too many games to really be considered as a finalist
> If it were for actually being good at playing defense someone else would win it.  Good thing that's not what the award is for lol.
Defensively speaking, Miro is second to none and it’s not even close, but that’s not the main determinant for this award and or even really one at all.
Both have been amazing but they have 50 and 51 points. The way the voting has been the past years you’ve gotta have 70 points minimum to win it even with elite defense.
Sick bias
Having 2 true top 6 forwards probably has a lot more to do with how bad we are
How is it underwhelming? These are all awesome defenseman and do amazing things on the ice night in night out
Not really?  Josi had a 10 point lead on Makar in 3 more games, while playing significantly worse defense. This year Karlsson is likely to have a ~25 point lead on the next player, which is what changes the discussion.   This would be more like if Makar had won while only putting up 70-75 points versus Josi’s 96. Yes there’s a team record component, and personally I lean Fox, but it’s disingenuous to compare this to Makar winning.
Karlsson's season is more impressive than Josi's last year, and he doesn't have the same level of competition that Josi had in Makar last year.
Last year would like a word
Not with Fox and Makar winning it recently
He's playing almost 26 minutes a night on a team with a -73 goal differential. Of course his +/- is bad.
Which is exactly why it has been given to the highest scoring defenseman zero times in the last five seasons lol
Slavin, Burns and Skjei all in my honorable mentions who didn't make the graphic.
98 points for a D man on a bad team is more impressive than 96 points for a D man on a good team.   But more importantly, he has a 25 point gap on the 2nd highest scoring D man while Josi only had a 10 point gap on the 2nd highest scoring D man.   Even more importantly, Josi was 21st league-wide in even strength scoring last year, finishing 31 points back of 1st place. Karlsson is currently ties for 1st. He is outscoring McDavid at even strength.   Karlsson has a much stronger Norris resume than Josi had last year and no other D man has been as good as Makar was last year. It will be a travesty if he doesn't win the Norris.
He put up 82 points on an Ottawa team that was competing for a playoff spot all year back in 2016. You don't know what you're talking about.
I'd be voting to give it to the first goalie to get 100 pts
That would be great
I agree with this 100%
Miro! Miro! Miro!   Thank you for a real, unbiased opinion here. Not kidding
You know he's already won it twice right...?
Montour is having such a good season. You should really include him in the table. To only honorable mention him is an insult, when you have Dahlin, Heiskinen Hughes and Morrisey in the table ahead of him.
Grow up
How do you rate defensive impacts? And why should best defenseman mean best defensive defenseman? Defense to me is a team effort and one player is probably going to have much smaller impact than dito for offense.
It's not the determining factor, but when a defenseman is having a historic season offensively and is outscoring every other player by a significant amount then it deserves to be acknowledged.
You say that, but your team's top defenceman won it last year because he was better defensively than the guy who scored the most points
Dude is a about to hit 100 points as a defenseman on one of the worst teams in the league
Imagine looking at +\- on a team with a -73 goal differential
It's a bad stat unless it shows extremes over a very large sample size. I could be the best Dman in the world, but if I've got a team of AHL forwards, we're going to have a bad time in our own zone when McDavid and company start to cycle.
Plus/Minus needs to just be abolished as a stat so we don’t need to keep having this same discussion every year lol
Lol plus minus
The only plus minus that seems to be a true factor here is your -10
But you are not wrong.
Makar is likely only going to play 60 games he has no chance to win it this year.
You could genuinely make a case for Lindholm being the best defensive defenseman in the league right now. I'd take him over any of the players OP listed in an extremely important defensive zone start or to penalty kill.   That being said, while his offensive game is still way better than average (51 points in 76 games is excellent), that still puts him 16th among defensemen in the league. His ultra reliable high IQ defensive game is the opposite of flashy, and his efforts tend to go unnoticed as a result. Kind of similar to Marc-Edouard Vlasic back when he was in the prime of his career.   If his point totals were in the top 10 among defensemen in the league he'd have a shot of being a finalist.
As a hockey player, he’s elite and right with these guys.  His point totals aren’t high enough to get him the Norris look he probably deserves.
Not as bad as people make him out to be. He excels in a lot of areas of defense. He's excellent at winning puck battles in corners and getting the puck out of danger and up the ice. He is one of the best in the league at disrupting passes. He's a very good shot blocker. He is one of the best in the league at zone exits.  The areas where he struggles are his defending off the rush (namely because he has trouble pivoting ever since the Cooke injury in 2013), and sometimes his coverage in front of the net can be loose (although a lot of modern dmen struggle with this, even elite ones).  People usually watch highlights of him making a risky play at the blueline and the puck getting turned over, but that's not really too much of an issue for him, and a lot of those times it's also on his teammates for not reading the play and dropping back for him when he tries to skate the puck in. He's played with Megna for almost the whole year who should probably be in the AHL, just a bad defender.
He is overall average in the dzone when they are trying to win games.  Hes good at breaking up passes, blocking shots.  He can dig a puck out of the corner well. Hes not big so hes not going to clear the net and hes not going muscle people off the puck.    The "bad at defense" crowd mostly surrounds him taking risky chances to push a play forward, a lot of the time its because the teams are behind so hes pushing offense.      People harp on his +/- this year but something like 20 empty net goals have been scored while hes on the ice at the end of the game.
He’s on the updated graphic.   https://imgur.com/a/VnSOzhZ
Routinely shuts down McDavid and people don’t even know who he is cause he doesn’t rack up a bunch of secondary assists
Also the most irrelevant
I'd bet petey will be. Hughes is 2nd in my prediction. As for who I'd rather have? Don't care,  both would be great. Just not JT please , lol
How will he be the captain of the Canucks if he's on the Devils?
Morrissey looks like a gray alien wearing a human skin mask.
Last month 23 points (3 + 20) in 15 games
Deboer should get a decent amount of credit as well. He gets his defensemen to push forward unlike Bowness and Miro’s elevated his game the same way Theodore did in Vegas under Deboer
You can thank the departure of Klinger for that. Huge boost in power play time and points
Yeah maybe if he stops getting saddled with the corpse of Ryan Suter and actually plays with a good partner
Hahahaha I love your totally honest, objective take on things
That’s what happens when you don’t PK.  Also after a full season there’s no need to use expected stats. You have 80 games, literally thousands of minutes of real data at that point.
On the ice for 20 ENG this year.
I kind of wonder if Dahlin and Power are going to start leeching Norris votes from each other. Besides the goal that went off of him last night, Power was incredible.
Dude was unstoppable. Most games to start the year with a goal for a defenseman, and I don’t recall what it is now..6? He was amazing at the start
They've actually been rotating a bit. Seigs hasn't been 100% a rock this year, and now they're trying Bahl with Dougie and it's gone well. I think he should absolutely be a finalist.
Siegenthaler’s kinda been low key mediocre for awhile and got healthy scratched again. Dougie’s still been fine regardless though
EK is going to get it but Hamilton would have my vote.
!Adam fox
Dougie and Siegs/Bahl have been the top pairing going against first lines most of the season.  Your point is true but it doesn't apply here since Hamilton is part of our top pair.  Marino Graves have feasted on the 2nd lines of opposing teams.
Marino and Graves are one of the best shut down pairings in the league, so Dougie doesnt need to be relied upon
Look at xGF and xGA. That shows Karlsson having a positive impact, right?   +/- could indicate having a sieve for a goaltender. One of the reasons it tends to be dismissed in discussions like this.
I’m definitely a biased Karlsson homer but this is a horrible take. Literally any top defenseman would have a terrible +/- on the sharks. His d partner has been Ahl/nhl bubble guys for 90% of the season and he plays in front of some of the worst goaltending in the league.
Bro, he's on the Sharks. Everyone has a bad +/- for us this season lol.
Hamilton might be the only player on this list with defense as bad as Karlsson
Personally I don’t dig this idea because it makes it super likely that the best overall d-man doesn’t actually win anything. Like Victor Hedman was neither the best offensive d-man or the best pure defender when he won, but his overall contribution on both ends of the ice made him the best. I’m cool with making a new trophy for the highest scoring d-man, but the Norris criteria should stay as is IMO.
I’m definitely for that, I think in general the league has outgrown the set of major trophies that have been largely unchanged for several decades now. I believe the most recent addition was the Rocket in 1999 and before that it was the Selke in 1978 lol  Personally, I would keep the Norris as is to still act as an MVP defenseman award while adding that Orr trophy/Art Ross equivalent and a Selke-equivalent (Harvey?) to acknowledge guys that shut everything down even if they don’t have the offense to be amongst the best defensemen overall. Having one trophy for defenseman when there are essentially 3-5 for forwards (Selke, Rocket, and Art Ross are pretty much guaranteed to be forwards while Hart/Lindsay can go to any position but favor forwards) is wild lol  I’d also definitely add a Gretzky trophy for the most assists in the league. We already have the Rocket and Art Ross, why not also acknowledge the playmakers lol   The league has so many more fucking players now compared to when most of the awards were introduced so I don’t see any reason to not add more. The MLB, for example, literally doubles their awards because they are each given out by conference lol
That makes sense, no worries at all! I just wasn’t sure if that was meant to be a big part of the discussion or not but definitely fair to be keeping tabs on market value haha
He has a 53% *expected* gf% while not playing on the PK. I wonder what his even strength GF% is.
From what I can find, Dom Luszczyszyn’s model has him at [the 15th percentile in the league](https://theathletic.com/3989347/2023/01/30/nhl-player-cards-san-jose-sharks-2/?source=user_shared_article), JFresh has him at [the 0th percentile](https://www.patreon.com/posts/2022-23-player-79150996), he gives up an assload of shots/chances and has a really high xGA/60 at 2.86 per [MoneyPuck](https://www.moneypuck.com/stats.htm), and in the few games I have watched this year he’s never really seemed like anything but bad in his own end lol  Maybe I needed to have watched him more this season but all the data suggests he is trash lol
Yep, and the Sharks have a positive +/- when he is on the ice.
To build on this - he is also on a team that has no one cracking 70 points (Couture 66, Hertl 60, Meier 52, Barabanov 47 - everyone else is below 35) playing 26 minutes on average whilst not missing a game this season.  EK is -16, being in for 19 empty net goals. Mario Ferraro, the only other Dman in SJS to put up 20 minutes a night on average, is -28.  He has 9 more points than the rest of the Sharks D has had this year.  His comments about feeling his injury in years prior and showing up like this after saying he's feeling primed up and ready to go again makes me wonder what that injury robbed the viewers of.
Look at his xGF% on the team he's playing on. He completely tilts the ice to the point where *San Jose* is the better team when he's out there.
Have you seen the team playing around him? I'm surprised he isn't lower than that
+7 5 v 5
You have to look at -+ relative to team goal differential and other players on the team.   The Sharks have a -73 goal differential this year. There are 7 other players on the team with the same or worse +- and their worst performer is Barbanov at -30. Karlsson has also played more games than all of them and his +-/60 is better than most other Sharks. No one who played more than 4 games with the Sharks this year has a positive +-. Their goalies have S% of 0.894 and 0.879.   Karlsson is #3 among defensemen in the league for takeaways. His xGA/60 and Shot Attempts Allowed are elite level while playing on the Sharks even though most of the others here slightly edge him out in xGA/60. He's a real 2 way defenseman and not a defensive liability.   This is a perfect case to show why -+ can be a misleading stat when taken out of context.
It’s like you didn’t read any of my comment lol again, yes Karlsson is bad defensively but that is more than outweighed by his offense. You can easily call him the best defenseman because he has the best total impact of anyone this season lol  Also, +/- is complete trash and is entirely dependent on a players team/goalie. OP already outlined a far superior stat that captures what your alluding to in xGF%, which for Karlsson is pretty damn good at ~54% despite playing for the fucking Sharks lol   Every single defenseman on this list would have a negative +/- if they played 25+ minutes a night for San Jose and wanted to put up any sort of point production.
You cannot be an elite defenseman in 2023 and not have an elite offensive game. Every team in the league activates their defense offensively. Even the shutdown defenders are expected to play aggressively in offensive scenarios.
Karlsson makes San Jose a better team, at even strength San Jose is a plus in goal differential, while without him on the ice they are a major minus, which clearly says his offense + defensive greatly improves San Jose's chances.
That was all he needed, apparently!
Like Karlsson in 2016 when he also had the most points compared to Doughty lol
Except if you watch a sharks game you’d see hes not above average defensively
> above average defensively this year.   is he though? His xGA/60 is the second worst here, albeit among really good defensemen. xGF% is great, but this is a clear case of his dominant offense outweighing his below average defensive play  I'd still say he deserves the Norris for that though.
I like Edwards but I can fully acknowledge that he’s not good at his job haha. Still, even tho I disagree with most of his takes, I find him entertaining and will always have a soft spot for him
I wouldn't want to rock a Montreal flair either
What a brave take.
He has been in the business for decades, calling all sorts of sporting events. The man is respected in the industry but not by butthurt fans who feel victimized when he makes jokes about their team. Give your balls a tug
Ah maybe the thing I read said “more than 103”? In any case, when you’re on a 3 or 4 person list with Orr, Coffey, and/or MacInnis, I think some type of award is in order haha
Hampus is one of those dmen where you just feel less anxious when he's on the ice. Incredibly reliable defenseman who makes very few mistakes.
Is McAvoy better defensively? I haven’t watched the Bruins enough.
If I needed to protect a lead, kill a penalty, or pick any defenseman to put in an important defensive zone start, I would go with Lindholm over anyone in OP's post, maybe any other defenseman in the league at this point. In terms of pure defense, I don't think there's anyone better than Lindholm is.   That being said, while Lindholm's 51 points in 76 games is excellent, it still leaves him in 16th in the league among defensemen. And while his very high IQ defensive awareness, world class positioning, transition passing and gap control is among the very best out there, it's not exactly flashy. Lindholm's play means he doesn't really stick out, but on the flip side, neither do the star players he's covering. Fantastic ability to have, but not one that earns a lot of Norris votes.
19 as of three weeks ago, I can't find a more updated number
He's not even average on D if we're being honest. He's so slow and has a tendency to give up on plays. His partner is the defensively responsible one, whether it be Siegs or more recently Bahl. Graves-Marino also take tougher assignments.    BUT it works because he scores enough to make up for it. He's broken every Devils dman scoring record this year.
My mom is hella short and will straight up run away in any store lmao, I feel your pain
I accompany my MIL, she's high 60s, and barely 5 foot tall...  There should be a support group.
While actually playing defense, or at least playing the role.  #1 dman on the team in toi/pg short handed last I looked.  That's a good chunk of time in a pure defensive role.
We're currently on track to win the central and are 8-2 in the last 10. Probably a little premature to be assuming our demise. If a couple more guys get healthy we'll be in decent shape for another deep run. If Makar and Landeskog come back we'll be stacked.
Head canon is Makar/Helm/Landeskog all come out to play come playoffs (pls God lol). Big time “bring out ya dead” year though for sure.
Karlsson is having a historic offensive year while maintaining top 10 offensive stats.  Fox is tied for 3rd amongst defensemen with significantly better defensive stats.   The argument becomes is Karlssons 27 point lead worth the drop in defense? Most will argue it is. Others will argue, like the argument surrounding the Hart every year, that being the highest scoring doesn't mean you're the best.
He doesn’t play defense
I agree. Another case in point: Karlsson (last time I checked) led the league in EN goals against (20+) which drowns his +/-. That's simply because the Sharks as a squad are bad, nit specifically because Karlsson is bad at defense
It counts for something. Unfortunately for fox and lindholm, not as much as scoring 100 points though
You genuinely believe Erik Karlsson doesn’t play his position correctly?
> Unfortunately we all know that playing the position correctly isn’t really considered when the Norris winner is selected  Playing the position correctly is by helping your team be better. That could be either scoring or preventing goals.
Everybody says that but Makar, Fox, Josi, Giordano, and Hedman absolutely deserved their trophies. They were the best overall defensemen which is what the trophy is for
Given that the award is for regular season performance I fail to see your point lmao
Last i checked a defenseman was supposed to be good at playing defense. So logically speaking you should have to be good at playing defense to be considered the best defenseman.   He's a great player and having a great offensive year don't get me wrong... but it's rather unfortunate that those who actually play defense very well aren't going to get considered because they don't put up 100 point seasons
For a defenseman to have as many points as Karlsson and still come out negative in plus/minus? Yeah, that says something. It's not the be all, end all, and it doesn't mean he sucks, but it certainly knocks him out of the top spot in my opinion.
Which is unfortunate, because in a situation where I'm protecting a lead, killing a powerplay, or taking an important defensive zone start, I'm taking Lindholm over every player OP originally listed, easily. Best defensive game in the league right now IMO.
Josi had the highest point total by a defenseman in 30 years, which is the exact same logic used to give Karlsson the award this year. But Josi actually plays defense. Plus there’s the whole part where Josi got more first place votes, but didn’t win because multiple voters left him off the ballot completely, which is asinine.
More points is the only thing better about Karlssons year
hughes plays that too on a team that isn't much better and is +15 so it's not impossible, he gets 0 respect though as shown in these comments
When everyone talks Norris, what it the first thing that is mentioned every single time? Points. Points, points, points
To make that stat even more insane, he was top 5 in league scoring and finished with the most assists by any player in the league that year. All on a team where the next highest player was Stone who finished in the 60s if I recall correctly  But Doughty *deserved* it more of course that year
He wasn't -15 despite having over 70 even strength points in either of those years
Montour and Dunn would be on the graphic if I made it 10 players.
dougie hamilton is on the graphic lol
He isn’t good at defense?
Especially a player with a positive 5v5 GF% on that team.
Imagine voting for best defenseman based on a chart full of offensive stats.
I’m still new-ish to the sport and it feels like +/- paints a bigger picture than seeing the goals/assists, so I want to know what you guys know that I haven’t gotten yet. Is it more of a stat to judge an overall teams performance rather than an individual?
Oh that I’m aware,he’s been injured as shit this season, I’m not knocking on Makar at all, I’m a huge fan of him, but it seemed like it was a popularity contest last season, Josi dominated on both the offensive and defensive and still lost the Norris to Makar, it just felt rigged to me. But I think this is no doubt Karlsson’s year
You misspelled everyone.  He shuts down everyone.  If I needed someone to stop a doomsday device.  I'm calling Jonas Brodin
Most people thought Petey, too. But apparently he says he doesn't want it now, and there is uncertainty with his contract.  Since Horvat left, Hughes has really stepped up, especially in the media.  I always thought it would be Petey, but the past few months have changed the opinion of me and a lot of others on r/Canucks about Hughes.  I know we're not representative of the entire fanbase, but it seems the general perception of Hughes as a leader is shifting.  Apparently a few people in the media seem to feel that the organization is leaning towards Hughes, too.  It really does depend on whether or not they want a captain next year or not. If they do, it will be Hughes. If they want to wait, that could change—especially if Petey signs an 8 year extension.
So are you saying Karlsson is a grey alien wearing a Guy Fawkes human skin mask? 🤣
Which we don’t really have at the moment
Dougie might have a new partner in crime with the Bahl-breaker. Totally different play style than Seigs, but when he plays smart he can keep Dougie out of trouble.
He's been fine, just not as good as earlier or last season. That last scratch was more man management with a sprinkle of Bahl playing like a madman
fuck adam fox
Right, and I don't have a problem with the Devils using Dougie in advantageous spots, but it's worth mentioning in a Norris conversation that his shiny 56 xGF% is coming in easier minutes than those played by Fox and Makar.
Yeah, I see that and agree he is certainly having a major impact, no doubt. He probably deserves the Norris. But Hamilton is the key in the Devils rise from also ran team last year to second this year (due respect to the improvement in Nico’s game this year too).
Or, he is all about offense and little about defense?
I totally agree.  Just like the Hart, Art Ross and Richard trophies.  Hart goes to the MVP, Ross to most points and Richard to the most goals.  Come to think of it, maybe there should be a ‘Gretzky’ Trophy given only to the player who had the most goals and assists in 1 year.  Not given out every year as the criteria needs to be fulfilled.
They actually have to weight the defensive play evenly.  That would drop Karlsson out of the picture for being objectively bad on defense.  So bad, that he isn't even on the PK because he is a liability.  I will give a Norris to a guy who isn't contending, I don't care about your cap hit and plus minus isn't everything. However, I do refuse to be stat sheet woo girl that rewards dogshit defense.  Miro, Hamilton and Fox are at least playing above average defense to go with that offense.
Simple solution is to have an offensive defenseman award (Bobby Orr) and a defensive defenseman award (Larry Robinson?), then combine their voting for the best overall defenseman award (Norris)  Example: player A is voted best offensive dman in the league, but unranked in defensive voting. Player B is 4th in offense, 1st in defense. Player C is 2nd in both. Player A wins the Bobby Orr award, player B wins the Larry Robinson award, player C wins the Norris.
You both had good points, the first thing I said when I saw the cap hit on there was “this is literally the norris winner. He should be the highest paid defenseman in the league”
eGF% is only 5v5 already, I thought?
he is, lol. and his offense is so amazing that he's still ridiculously good.
Oh dude we knew he would have just been insane had he never gotten injured
Conversely, he has 100 points and only 53% of the expected goals? That screams offensive dynamo with little regard for defense. The whole team is bad defensively, yes, but this is the award for the best defenseman in the league, and I would think the best defenseman in the league would be playing passable enough defense that they would have some insanely high xGF% while putting up 100 points.
hes so fucking bad at defense lol
I swear some people in this sub want Douglas Murray to win the Norris.
Lol, look at the sharks gf/ga against metrics when he’s on the ice versus off it. If you’re team number are significantly better when you’re on the ice rather than off it, then you are an incredibly important part of the team.  I mean for god sakes man the sharks have a .47 higher xGF than xGA when he’s on the ice, on the list above thats 3rd to only Makar and Hamilton who both play on cup contenders, and Karlsson plays on one of the worst teams in the league. Think about how bad they suck when he’s off the ice to still be 4th last when he’s putting up numbers like that.
I watch him play all the time and don’t get why people have this insane hate boner for his defense. People see a few bad clips and a bad plus minus and that’s it.  He’s by no means great defensively but he is not a walking liability on defense like people think.
I mean I just watched two back to back and he was fine. He broke up rushes and passes just fine and his ability to break the puck out was excellent.
>I find him entertaining  *That* is his job
Precisely. Jack has some brutal tales and I find myself shaking my head sometimes. But more often I find myself laughing at his comments, quirks, and quotes. He brings life to the games which I will gladly accept. Plus Brick as you said below has great analysis and insight. He’s always calm too so it makes for a great dynamic between the two.
He is a delight to watch while being shit at his job.
No one cares.
What a useless comment.
Learned from the best. There is Niedermayer training in his DNA.
I remember those types guys in front of me as a goalie. The mental relief is palpable and honestly makes you play better. Even when they're off the ice, just being able to like 'calibrate' to the game with those guys in front of you is so important.
Hard to say because they have such different styles, McAvoy is always all over the place and Lindholm is always in the right place. I would give a slight edge to Lindy - I’d rather have him on a must have PK but I want McAvoy on the ice in OT
In previous years, yes. This year, no. Lindholm is probably having the best year of his career and McAvoy had offseason shoulder surgery so he took a while to get fully into gear.
Even strength I’d take Charlie. It’s damn near splitting hairs. Hampus is probably slight better at transition passing for zone exit. DZone even strength I’ll take Charlie and his willingness to lean into the forwards and grind a bit on the boards more than Lindholm. Like both, but they play slightly different styles.    Hampus opened the year with an absolute bang, and he and Clifton are a super dynamic pair probably on par with McAvoy and Grzelyck when Matt’s playing at his best. But I’ll take Charlie’s physical style.   Charlie’s been one of the best even strength DMen in the league for a number of years for a reason. He’s really, really damned good in his zone and driving out of it.
Are those all empty net goals against? That’s crazy! Dude has been amazing all year. The Norris should be his!
Karlsson leads Makar in takeaways, on ice expected goal differential, shots blocked, and shot attempts against/60. Makar is great, but Karlsson is an elite defensive defender this season as well.   Karlsson plays almost as much time as Makar (42.4% possible vs 43.3% possible). Karlsson has also played in every game this season which is something Makar has never been able to do.
we've been 27-7-3 since January 14th. We're still a beast lol.
Fox is on a contender.  Karlsson is on one of the worst teams in the league.  Of course his D numbers are awful.
I agree. Karlsson has a lot of points but isn’t strong defensively. He’s a fourth forward out there and his team isn’t good. I’d rather see a defenseman on a playoff team who puts up 50-60 points and is better defensively win the award for best defenseman
The team has a positive even strength goal differential with him on the ice, and a differential worse than -60 with him off of it. His shot metrics, while not as lopsided, also having him on the ice to having him off, and outweigh his offensive strengths beyond his defensive weaknesses  At a certain point it doesn't matter as long as you get the differential
He's among the league best in several defensive categories. "He doesn't play defense" people need to get a grip.
Doesn’t really matter with his offense launching into a different stratosphere than the rest of the field lol no one has had a better overall impact than Karlsson.
[This clip/thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/11km22x/james_reimer_bails_erik_karlsson_out_with_a/) is the sort of things people think about when Karlsson and playing defense comes up.
"everybody says that but everyone except for Karlsson and Burns deserved their Norris wins! Karlsson is a small Swedish guy and a Toronto fan told me he's bad defensively so now I think he's undeserving of his accolades!"
The Norris is for the "best all around dman" not who's the best at playing defence. Defenceman haven't been expected to only play defence for over 60 years, and like forwards, have a variety of roles they can fill. Karlsson has been the best player that plays the defenseman position, so he deserves the Norris.
Josi is not better defensively than Karlsson, he just plays on a better team with much better goaltending.
That’s because points are the easiest/fastest way to judge someone’s individual impact on their team winning games, as has been the case for like 100 years in this league lol  Points are brought up in every single trophy discussion for all skaters for good reason. Being the point leader doesn’t automatically give you the Norris but it does automatically put you in the conversation (usually.. there’s always odd cases like Barrie in 2021) and why shouldn’t it?
Lol, +\-
And Morrissey is heaps better defensively? Put any of the guys you mentioned on the sharks and I guarantee they end the season with a negative +/-
You are on the right track already! Yes, +/- can be fine for evaluating an overall team (as in, the Bruins are obviously unreal at +121 this year while the Ducks obviously fucking suck at -124) but these stats are skewed by a ton of factors that one player or even a whole team simply cannot control, mainly how good your goaltender is and how well your skaters can finish/put the puck in the net (two things that are very volatile in hockey), and +/- has weird calculations like shorthanded goals against are a minus but powerplay goals aren’t a plus, empty net goals are a minus, etc. So it just really isn’t that useful now that so much better data is available across the league.  If we stick on the Karlsson debate and [look at the Sharks this year](https://www.nhl.com/stats/skaters?reportType=season&seasonFrom=20222023&seasonTo=20222023&gameType=2&playerPlayedFor=franchise.29&filter=gamesPlayed,gte,39&sort=plusMinus&page=0&pageSize=50 ), there is literally one skater with a meaningful number of games that is a plus player (Megna at +6, who was traded away over a month ago). The Sharks clearly suck as an entire team and their goaltending especially is sinking them by being well below average (.902 team average vs. .920 league average).  So if we dig further and get into more advanced stats, the current go-to for evaluating a players base impact on creating goals for the team is “expected goals for” (xGF) and on preventing goals against the team it’s “expected goals against” (xGA). The “expected” part is essentially just an estimate of how likely a player is to have a goal scored for/against them based the on number and location of shots taken, the closer a shot is taken from the net is given a higher “expected” value vs. a shot taken from further away as, historically, closer shots go in the net at a higher rate than shots from further away. Obviously more shot volume will also increase the likelihood of a goal being scored. Back to the Sharks, they have 295 actual goals against this year (3rd worst in NHL) but their xGA is only 260 (8th worst in NHL), which keys you in that their goaltending really does suck and is making them worse than their skaters’ defense would imply.  The net ratio of these two expected stats is xGF%, which has basically replaced +/- in most people’s eyes now since it is much more accurate in describing a players’ own personal impact on the team. For Karlsson, his minus -16 stat is bad but [his xGF% is ~56.5%](https://www.naturalstattrick.com/playerteams.php?fromseason=20222023&thruseason=20222023&stype=2&sit=all&score=all&stdoi=oi&rate=n&team=S.J&pos=S&loc=B&toi=0&gpfilt=none&fd=&td=&tgp=410&lines=single&draftteam=ALL) so overall, when he’s on the ice the Sharks are expecting to outscore their opponent by a good bit.  There is a lot more to this and how to evaluate players, such as situation strengths (5v5 play vs. powerplays, penalty kills, 4v4, etc), using these stats on a per game or per 60 minutes of play basis, “expected” stats not being perfect due to some data that isn’t publicly available, etc. but I feel like this comment is already too long to get into everything lol  Does that help as a basic (yet long) overview?
Yeah but McDavid is more impressive and I don’t really see anyone else doing it like Brodin has
I don't think there's any indication one way or the other. Hughes I always knew as a quiet locker room leader. He's definitely showing it publicly now, though. I think management is gonna let them decide between each other tbh. Both are obviously the captains, and it's not gonna matter who wears the C. And if hughes is more down with it, then I agree he should be the C.
Harley is awesome
Hopefully Harley or Nils can mature into a good parter. Keep Hakanpää and Suter away from him.
This is not all true. The Devils rise this year is a multitude of things. They include Jack, Nico, Dougie, Bratt, AND Mercer taking huge steps in development.   Getting Marino for practically nothing and letting Sevo play third pairing minutes has really allowed the D to lock down opponents.   Having V2 in net with league average goaltending is why they rose this year. Dougie is one part in the entire machine
There's an older article somewhere that does a detailed analysis of prior Norris winners, and what's needed on their resume. One of the strongest correlated pieces was the team making the playoffs.   Karlsson may very well break that trend this year, but that article supports what you're saying about Hamilton
I mean if that’s the argument then Dougie isn’t much further ahead in that regard. Dude is amazing but he barely plays defense.
The Art Ross is already given the person with the most goals and assists in a season, a Gretzky trophy should be given to whomever has the most assists every season
Also.  Quinn for the Norris.  + on a lottery team and close to 2nd in scoring
Your argument immediately loses merit when you say Karlsson is dogshit defensively, imo.
This ain’t a bad idea at all. I like it!
Given he italicized "expected" is that guy asking his actual GF%....which is to say his 5 on 5 goal differential. It's +7, no clue whether that's good or even meaningful, as it's such an odd stat.
> That screams offensive dynamo with little regard for defense  His team is playing at more or less a -1 goal differential per game. They are absolutely *terrible*. The fact that he can swing that back to positive when he's on the ice is ludicrous. Take a look at the team's relative expected goals % - the only player close to him is Hertl, there are only 3 other players above 3% (Karlsson is at 12.7%), and there are only 8 players on the roster coming out positive at all.  Seriously, go through and look at the performance of San Jose without Karlsson vs when he's on the ice. It's actually obscene how much better they are when he's out there, and it's frankly laughable that people are trying to use team-impacted stats to wave away how dominant he actually is.
>  SJ coaches are doing everything to put him in a situation to be on the ice in the offensive zone.   I wonder why they would do that with the clear best offensive D-man in the league.
Uh, yeah. If I had a defenseman as talented as him I would also do everything I could to put him out in offensive zone faceoffs. I watched the Sedins do it in 2010-2012, worked pretty good.
At least 30 points? You know he put up 78 points on a playoff team when he was 21 years old?  The ignorance in this thread is insane.
I disagree completely.   His defensive numbers are bad because the whole team is bad. Look at all the dudes in this pic and look at their teams. There are 4 legit cup contending teams,  3 bubbles (Canucks underperformed this year), and 1 team in the Bedard hunt. Hockey is a team game.   EK on a contending team has maybe 10-15 fewer points (still top in the NHL) but his defensive metrics are going to be better simply by being on a good team.   I’m not defending EK on defense but to say these other guys have massively better numbers (some are .2 lower xGA) is just a bad take.   EK on any of these teams has the same number of points and better defensive metrics.
Agreed. But these people just see big number/small number and don't look into it further than that.
Karlson plays good defense by driving offense, tilting the ice and preventing the other team from ever getting on offense. He’s not a shutdown defender, but he’s effective at driving possession and is fantastic at breakouts and transition play.
Same and I think right now his focus is reaching 100. Putting extra effort in defensively doesn’t help a team with a ton of holes and the team wants him to get 100 just as much as he does. Would be the only way to end the season on a high note.
It was the same when he was in Ottawa, people saw his insane numbers and decided that to get stats that good he must be bad defensively to be generating that much offense. Which is dumb.  Now I'm not saying I'd choose Karlsson to defend against McDavid on a breakaway in a game 7 overtime or anything, there are definitely defenders in the league better at handling that. But Karlsson would be a top 4 defenceman on any team in the league even if his offense was average.
EK can be a bit hit/miss sometimes, but that's just the kind of defensemen he is. He drives offensive play to such a strong degree that really 90% of the time he's on ice he's creating chances whatnot, rather than needing to defend.l  Kind of a don't need to defend if they never get to attack kind of deal. That and he's playing on an absolute stinnker of a team too. Pair him with a decent team and a solid shutdown defensemen and he'll look even more incredible.
I guess what I mean is if we’re going by technical game calling competency, he’s objectively bad. Which a lot of people prioritize over just pure entertainment factor, right or wrong. Also Brick is one of the best, if not the best, analysts in the game so I’d still be watching NESN even if I hated Jack  Also your Jack is probably my 2nd favorite play by play guy fwiw
It’s always good to self-reflect.
Not really sure you can compare them looking at Hampus's previous couple of seasons where he was playing on an Anaheim roster that was an absolute train wreck defensively. His first three seasons, in the NHL back when the Ducks were still contenders (one of which we allowed the fewest goals in the league), he was already far and away the best defensive defenseman on our roster, and arguably our best defenseman overall by the end of his sophomore season.  Overall, 5 on 5 I'd take Charlie by the tiniest margin, but on the PK, an important defensive zone start, or defending a lead in general, I'd take Lindholm.
Lindholm doesn’t play with Clifton. He’s played with Carlo more than anyone else
Yup! We've given up a crazy number of ENGs this season, and Karlsson's been on the ice for almost all (if not all) of them since he's also our best option to try and tie the game up haha
Yeah, story of the Sharks this season is being close in a lot of games, but falling apart in the 3rd Period.  Also OTL's and the worst goaltending I've seen. But that's all bc Karlsson has been so darn good
A lot of those non percentage stats get padded when you play on a team losing the possession game. How much short handed time has ek played?  Judging a defender by their defensive abilities is very tough by statistics, which is why the norris talk is supported primarily by offensive stats.  A lot of it is an eye test.  And if you're an elite defensive defender you'll be playing on the pk.
A contender who gave the Sharks their first win of the season...
The typical defenseman who puts up 50-60 points on a playoff team is probably going to have 30-40 % of his points on the PP, while having actual good players with him 5v5. I think it's incredibly backwards to rate a defenseman higher because the rest of the 17+ players are better.
Anyone who says Karlsson is a 4th forward immediately just shows how ignorant they are.
I lean towards that camp as well, however I also think that the evolution of the game needs to be considered.  We are increasingly seeing offensive defensemen dominate the conversation of "best" and the argument has to be made that at some point being okay or even poor defensively can be made up by being elite or great offensively.  Im just not sure where *that* line is
I agree with this how can you give some the best defenseman award when he's -16. Sure he puts up huge points but having almost 100 points and being that negative means your poor defensively which is the whole point of the position...
I wish stats graphics would more often show +/- relative to the whole team's goal differential
I think aside from whether he's a defensive stalwart I don't think people take into account how much a certain player might add some sort of "defensive" value with their puck possession skills and keeping the puck in the offensive zone.
He leads the league in giveaways by a defenseman.
There’s only one stratosphere. The stratosphere. If you want to go higher your choices are the thermoshpere and the ionosphere.
Josi had the best offensive numbers last year on a better Nashville team but Makar still won it because he was better at the defensive side of the game.
By that logic why not give the Selke to McDavid.
You could cherry pick any one bad play (while the guy is out of gas towards the end of a shift) from any defenseman in the league throughout an entire season and make them look like trash lol this means nothing.  Karlsson is bad defensively, yes, but offense is also just as important and his offense this year is other worldly,it more than makes up for his defensive issues.
I’m sorry that my arbitrary cut off of 5 years wasn’t good enough for you
Oh dang. I didn’t realize every goal wasn’t factored in! Thank you so much for laying all this out, and it really does help explain how while it’s a cursory glance, there’s so much more that can go into determining what needs to be broken down to get to the final answer of how strong or weak a player is. I really appreciate it and I hope this helps others understand it better too!!
Hughes is maturing as a player but both him and Pettersson are far from natural leaders.  How is Hughes going to be able to hold vets like Miller accountable?  You can’t force the issue.  A captain needs to naturally develop to be an effective leader in the room.    I see Hughes being able to wear a C in a few more seasons but I see Pettersson always as an alternate.  It just feels forced with this team’s fanbase wanting Petey or Hughes wearing the C.   I think it’s unhealthy to not have a natural captain named for the season but if you don’t have the right guy in the room it’s even worse forcing the issue IMO.    I’ll gladly eat my words but this team has consistently been critiqued for being too quiet on the ice and in the room.  These two guys are way too demure and soft spoken to be the alpha to the alphas.
That trend was broken two years ago by Adam Fox.
I think he means a season where a player leads in both categories. Like the Triple Crown in Baseball. It happens but only occasionally.
People that say this have seen him only in highlights and maybe once a year when he’s in town.
Yeah you got my meaning, expected vs actual. After 80 games expected stats is silly to me. If there’s a big difference between expected and actual after thousands of minutes, it’s more than likely not due to luck but rather that expected stats can’t capture the full complexity of the game.  +7 at even strength is pretty good on a shitty team even with favorable zone starts.
Karlsson does have a (slightly) worse xGA rate than the Sharks as a team. His offence is obviously overpowering, but SJS is conceding more against when he's out there.
Most people think he's terrible defensively while realistically he's average. Most of the examples people use for him being terrible are after he's been on the ice for 6 out of 8 minutes and he's absolutely gassed.
He did it for a time and it was very good. Almost 300 minutes. They’re like Charlie-Grze except the sizes are reversed. Lindy’s the finesse and Cliffy has the boom.    Might could be a playoff option depending on how the Orlov/Forbort/Grzelyck situation shakes out.
Makar averaged 1:24 shorthanded min/game ~~this season~~ last season.   Karlsson averaged 1:29 shorthanded min/game ~~this season~~ last season.   Toews plays more SH than Makar.  Edit: woops, those were 2021-22 numbers. Makar has way more time this year. See their reply.
Yeah, its a moronic view, that just tells me people don't watch the games.  I mean i get it, no one has time to watch 32 teams and study the defense on each, but why just make up stuff.  I guess it's an easy narrative.  Aside from Karlsson, the sharks have just two players above 50 points... and only 3 with over 40.... that is just insane this year. Compare that to some of the other players in consideration for the Norris and it's just inane what hes done.
It’s not ignorant. He’s never been the best defender but he makes things happen on offense. He was great when he was paired with Methot because Methot covered for him when he rushed the puck but I’ve watched most of his career and he’s never been the best in his own end. This sub acts like he’s the perfect defenseman but he’s not, he’s just a great offensive player
The league just needs to introduce a new trophy for the position. Have an Art Ross for defensemen and then the Norris can remain for those who are the best all round at their position. I don’t think Karlsson is the best defenseman but he should get credit for his season, I just don’t believe it should be the Norris when he’s on a non-playoff team and he’s weak in his own end.
Plus minus is iffy but just watching him play, he’s not good at defense. I agree with the rest of the point though, like it’s awesome he’s just chasing stats but he’s not changing his team’s success at all
+/- is just a goalie/shooter stat though so there's no point using it for anything. Just use xGA/xGF with/without the player if you want to know about their individual impact.
Lol you think giveaways is a defensive stat?  Your supposed pick for the Norris (Hamilton) is in the top 10 for giveaways as well. I guess he doesn't play defense either.  If you have the puck on your stick a lot, you will usually have a lot of giveaways.
He’s in the Martian stratosphere, he’s otherworldly lol
That’s because Josi wasn’t on a different planet offensively than Makar lol in that case where they were close enough on one end of the ice, Makar’s (much) superior defense did end up as the deciding factor.  But again, this year no one is close to Karlsson and what he’s doing with the puck. His defense is obviously terrible but he more than makes up for it with his offense.   Who would you say has been better all year long?
What..?   The Norris is for the best overall defenseman (Karlsson) and the Selke is for the best defensive forward (not McDavid). I’m not following your logic lol
I am not trying to minimize Karlsson's offensive success this year, and I don't have all the stats in front of me to strengthen my opinion on who should receive it, but the award is for the defensive player who exhibits the best '*all around play in the position*'. In my opinion, it should go to a defenseman who has great defensive **and** offensive stats and play. Karlsson certainly ticks the offensive side of the position, but I don't like the idea of a crazy offensive year making up for other areas that may be lacking. It is counter-intuitive to the 'all around play' part of the award description.
No worries! And yea, there is a fuck ton of things to consider, it’s wild how much information we now have access to compared to even like.. 10 years ago lol  I won’t be any more obnoxious trying to explain shit but if you want more resources to view advanced stats or explanations, I would recommend using any of these (some free and some are paid resources):  https://www.moneypuck.com/stats.htm  https://www.naturalstattrick.com/playerteams.php?fromseason=20222023&thruseason=20222023&stype=2&sit=5v5&score=all&stdoi=oi&rate=n&team=ALL&pos=S&loc=B&toi=0&gpfilt=none&fd=&td=&tgp=410&lines=single&draftteam=ALL  https://www.hockey-reference.com  https://theathletic.com/1019070/2019/06/14/improving-our-nhl-projection-model-ahead-of-the-2019-20-season/?source=user_shared_article  https://twitter.com/JFreshHockey/status/1631673879738368000/photo/2  When random advanced stats or graphs get posted on here, I would recommend just poking around these to see what the hell they’re talking about. That’s what helped me learn a lot more about advanced stats and player evaluation!
Based on the last several years for leading in both and assists:  2022-23: McDavid   1995-96: Lemieux   1988-89: Lemieux* (Tied on assists w Gretzky)  Gretzky last pulled it off in 1986-87 and pulled it off for 4 seasons from 81/82 through 84/85  Before Gretzky, it was Esposito in 72/73 who last pulled it off
I like the most assists in a season trophy idea for Gretzky, too. Not sure which I like more though.
Only sharks and sens fans know. Sad!
Expected stats are still better, even at 80 games, but I guess the same conclusion of "he's pretty good" is right. Hockey is mostly about generating chances and expected stats capture that better.   +7 is also a "volume" stat (meaning it is influenced by how much you play). For reference +7 puts him at a 12 way tie for 58th in the league. 5 on 5 on ice actual goal % is 51.9% which is tied for 89th best, which I'd say is not great but okay (of D with 400+ minutes of ice time, 218 qualify).  Edit: You were correct, he has very favorable zone starts, only 8.3% defensive zone.
> What would his xGF% be if his starts we just 50-50?   What would anyone's stats be if their coaches used them in ways that didn't fit their skills? He gets offensive starts because giving him offensive starts lets him dominate games. Other players would reward that usage less, because they aren't as good at that part of the game.  Trying to invalidate his performance because he'd do worse if he got dumped in for all of the D-zone draws instead of getting offensive chances is ridiculous.
most shifts start on the fly so the impact is pretty minimal actually and this can be seen in play-driving models. i’m not the biggest karlsson for norris guy but that argument doesn’t really hold for me
Yeah, Monty is good about mixing up pairs, especially in the last few months
NHL.com toi stats show, for sh toi/gp  Makar: 2.44  Ek: 0.23  Toews does have a higher time on ice at 3:10  https://www.nhl.com/stats/skaters?report=timeonice&reportType=season&seasonFrom=20222023&seasonTo=20222023&gameType=2&position=D&playerPlayedFor=franchise.27&filter=gamesPlayed,gte,1&sort=shTimeOnIcePerGame&page=0&pageSize=50  Not sure where we are mixing up our stats.
He gives the puck away more than he forces takeaways. I figured that would really matter to DEFENSE where your job is to hold on to the puck🤷‍♂️
I’d rather have a less offensively inclined defenseman who’s at least decent at defense win the Norris. It’s the best DEFENSEMAN award, there’s two facets to playing that position. I’d argue that even Dougie Hamilton earns probably the highest nods.
A lot of people miss this. As much as they yearn for the Norris to be about defensive play, by definition it is the best player who plays the position that is called "defenceman". You can be the worst defensive d-man in the league and still fulfill the requirements if you contribute in the aggregate
That’s fair but I honestly disagree. To me, “all around” is exactly what it sounds like - it’s just the greatest total impact of offense+defense but they don’t inherently have to be equal.   You could win while being great offensively/great defensively, amazing offensively/terrible defensively, maybe terrible offensively/amazing defensively, etc. As long as your total impact of all factors is the best, you should win the Norris.  I definitely see the arguments for guys like Fox, Lindholm, Makar (though lack of GP hurts him more than anything), etc. but in my opinion their strong two-way games this year don’t quite have a greater impact than Karlsson’s unreal offense, even with his horrid defense. What he has been doing with the puck all season is basically untouchable considering his gap over the field.
Oh man, thanks for sharing all this. Meanwhile I’ll be spending the weekend confirming the math makes sense on why the caps didn’t make the playoffs 😂😂 (lifelong Marylander here)
Yup. And pulling this off should earn someone the Wayne Gretzky award.  The NHL should also make a trophy that is unique and let the player keep it unlike the other awards where there is only one.
I'm ehh about that idea. Theres an assist leader every season. It would be super rare for someone to lead in both assists and goals. It would make the award more rare and prestigious, especially since you are tying it to Gretsky. The Gretsky award should be given for outlier exceptionalism considering theres already a MVP, points and outstanding player award.
Oh shit, you are right. My google search took me to the Hockey-reference page for 2021-22 which is the numbers I quoted.
Lmao your Norris favorite Hamilton has 71 giveaways to his 19 takeaways. You sure seem knowledgeable on this hockey thing.
It’s a best defenseMAN award, not best DEFENSE award. The goal of hockey is to win. Whichever defenseman gets you the most wins, wins.
Personally, I don’t think it really matters which end of the ice a defenseman gives the most on as long as their overall impact is the best lol   Hamilton also has pretty bad defensive metrics so he’s essentially just a worse Karlsson, I am not seeing how he is in the conversation if Karlsson is being glossed over.
Coming from a team that requires black magic to get a goal from our defence - I'd rather have a defensively serviceable guy who gets 80+ points and can clap rockets from the blue line any day of the week.
I guarantee you've watched maybe 2 Dougie Hamilton games this year.
I dunno man. Is it gonna be that rare ? Mcdavid looks poised to win that award this year, haha. I kid, I kid. You're right , Gretzky award should be this. There should be another ward for assists tho in that case. Who do we choose...
> My response is that coaching moves are the reason for such high xGF%, and he doesn't completely tilt the ice when he's out there.   So where are the other players ahead of him on offensive deployment? You said he's only 5th in that usage, right - if it's not because of his skills, there should be 4 other people at least *close* to his production, yeah?
Erik Karlsson is leading the league in even strength goals given up. 117. Negative goal differential. Even literally gave the Avs an OT game winner two nights ago.
So not Erik Karlsson. The argument I’m posing here is that Makar last year got less points than Josi but was a lot better, played PK time, while Josi did not play PK. He was the better overall rounded defenseman.
the crazy part is Lemieux pulled it off the season Gretzky went to LA
I get what you are saying but do we really need an award for that? The NHL is the only league that gives awards for leading in a statistical category whereas no other league does....given the NHL has way less statistical categories than other leagues. I don't see the value of an assists award honestly.
Oh so now the goalposts change because the metric you thought was most important didn't suit your narrative?  Yes, he plays #1 minutes on one of the worst teams in the league, with one of the worst goaltenders in the league. He's going to be on the ice for a lot of goals against. Now compare San Jose's goal differentials to when he's on the ice vs when he's not on.
The Sharks are positive when he’s on the ice and massively negative when he’s off. The fact that this dumpster fire team outscores anyone when he’s available shows how good he has been.
Is there anyone on the Devils that Luke Hughes knows well?  That would be especially valuable when it comes to "acclimating" himself with the team.
Hughes²
I fucking hate how the team breathing down our neck for the division has such a good prospect pool. Fucking hate everything about it.
I don’t foresee him playing any meaningful minutes this year unless they throw him in against Buffalo or Washington just to get him involved. But the playoffs will too important to just drop him in and try to acclimate to playoff hockey.
Now give Severson a box and help him move his shit out
Hopefully he gets over whatever was making him throw up last night before he gets into the locker room
Dougie, Marino, Siegenthaler, Graves (hopefully), Luke, Nemec, Bahl  Our potential defense next year is stupid good
This is getting out of hand, now there are two of them
Luke Hughes and Simon Nemec.   The Devil's have a pipeline of blue chip talent that can replace any depth they lose in the off season on the blueline. Let's say Graves and Severson leave in FA, the Devil's will be fine and I'm so fookin jealous
the disgusting brothers
2 OF 3 SET BONUS: +5 to shoot +10 to passing +30 gato  Y'all fucked when Quinn comes here in 4-5 years. You don't wanna know what that unlocks.
The Blue line in New Jersey is going to be stacked for years to come.
<3
:(
Jack just had a 4 point last night. He's sitting one point behind Patrick Elias for the most points in a single season and is 5 away from 100 on the year. Having Luke pass him the puck for both of those would be storybook for him
Who could've seen this coming.
😊
Congrats Devils’ fans  He’s going to be fun to watch.
Jeez I wonder what number he’s gonna wear
Devils living it up, I’m so ready for nhl playoffs
What is he going to do with all those 'W' on his transcript?
It would be sick to see him score in his first game like Makar did.
Hopefully he can play some defense
Quinn on the other coast in shambles right now
Maybe Lazar who played with his brother in Vancouver?
He played a game against the Swiss core of Sieg, Meier and Hischier at the World Championships. Maybe they'll adopt him as a brother, he could really use one.
Yeah I bet he wished Quinn Hughes was on the team so that he could have a brother to help acclimate himself with the team
Maybe that another kid who just happens to have the last name Hughes. They can bond over having the same last name
I read there's also another Hughes on Vancouver. I wonder if he'd be willing to sign with NJ just to play with more Hughes'
Is this a serious question?? Lol
This is getting out of hand…
*There is another.*
Twoghes.
I'm seeing double, here. Four Hughe's?!?
Hughes*2, not Hughes^2
I mean your prospect system is no joke either man.
Cale Makar? Cole Caufield?   They’re not going to throw him out there for 24 minutes a game, but a protected role as a 7th-D who gets o-zone starts and powerplay minutes would be fucking awesome.
If he's actually fine and the illness from last night is nothing then I'd have him in on Tuesday for sure. If not then at least Thursday. Get him into the morning skate tomorrow, full practice with the team Monday, morning skate Tuesday, and game Tuesday night. I imagine Jack's going to talk his ear off nonstop to teach him the system like Nico did with Timo.
They’d be silly not to play him against buffalo and/or Washington.  Just in case they have injuries in the playoffs
*looks at Makar with goal in his first game*
Oh, he will play meaningful minutes!  The remaining games are basically meaningless, so the team will rest its stars (except maybe Jack, to try and get him to 100pts), opening up minutes for the young guys.  Plus, they can play Luke all they want up to 9 games (and still not burn a year).  So he's going to get some action.  And if he does well, they might bite the bullet and exceed the 9 games (assuming they win at least the 1st round matchup).
>meaningful   >against Washington   Pick one
never fails to get me
That’s longest tenured New Jersey Devil Damon Severson to you
I love you man
#PACKYOURSHIT
As a long time Devils fan…. I’m going to miss Sevo. He stuck with us though some awful, awful teams and it’s an injustice that he will leave just as soon as the team gets good once again. Let’s go all the way for Sevo!
Username checks out
Maybe he was allergic to Portillo's terrible goaltending?
Wait, Luke was sick?
Another team will probably overpay for Graves tbh
I actually see our defense taking a bit of a step back next year. I don’t think we’ll be able to swing re-signing Graves as that will put us at a surplus of defensemen who NEED to be played, unless Graves is willing to sign a 1/2 year deal and we just keep Nemec marinating in the A. However, I think he’ll likely be wanting term. There are likely to be some growing pains with both Luke and Nemec and Graves+Sevo are simply better than they are due to experience. Luckily any regression should be short-lived. Our future is VERY bright, and Fitz/Shero have set us up for long-term success.
I don't want Nemec in the league until at least late next year unless he just blows you away in camp. I want him with another full AHL year. Then by that point I think he could be ready for playoff time. I'm also really not sure I want Graves back. I just don't think tying up money in him with term is the right move. I think Bahl could be able to fill his role decent enough. Then Luke replaces Sevo. You probably take a bit of a hit next year but I think they can do an adequate enough job and they're only going to get better. Luke-Nemec sheltered 3rd pair for the playoffs. 2 rookies together would be risky for sure but as a sheltered 3rd pair if Bahl can actually really handle a top 4 role it's something I'd love to see.
I think we could see Seigs get moved, eventually.  He's very good positionally and with his stick, but he's 6'3" and one of the least physical players on the team.  We dont know for sure but imo that's why he was sat that one game a couple months ago and has been working his way down the depth chart the last week or so. The emergence of Bahl looking like he's his clone but with a better shot and looking/playing tougher isnt helping his cause either.   I would definitely bring Graves back, him and Marino have formed one of the best shutdown pairs in the league this year. Sure Gravy has his mistakes but they're usually not catastrophic like Severson's.
Just wait until Quinn forces his way out of Vancouver and joins the Devils.
Seamus Casey is a pretty good D prospect also, not Hughes or Nemec level but he had a very good year at Michigan this year.
Now they just need some young stars on offense to pair with those two.
Jack "Tom Wambsgans" Hughes and Luke "Cousin Greg" Hughes
Hughes is a sturdy birdy
Quinn joins right around when Dougie expires. Its the perfect transition
Time is a circle!
😘
Luke assists on the most points, and Jack sets up Luke for his 1st goal on his 100th point. Mama Hughes has to do the ol’ split tape job on the puck to avoid a kitchen brawl.  Quinn sits alone in Vancouver and cries himself to sleep
Unlikely
Luke Hughes has a brother?
Wonder if he's related to the Canadiens' GM.
My favorite fun fact: Luke Hughes has played on the same team as Jack Hughes before. They were not related
Not on your life. He's our future Captain
Now, there are two of them.
The Hughes, they're here, they're there, they're every-fucking-where, the Hughes!
Always two there are
We’ve been shit for 10 years. Let us have this
Maybe, it will be interesting to see what happens with the Wolves
We have a ton of prospects, but Nikishin who is our best can't sign until 2025 (if he does)
They don’t even have their own future considerations wtf you talking about
lol Speaking of throwing a guy into the fire for 24 minutes a night, McAvoy had 4 games in Providence and then was thrown into the playoffs where he played 26 minutes a night. Now Luke isn't as responsible as McAvoy but we also aren't going to need Luke to play that much unless everyone goes down.   Please go 11-7 with Luke and fire Wood into the fucking sun. I know that won't happen because Lindy LOVES Wood but please just do it. Generally I'm against 11-7 but I don't want to take Bahl out and I want Luke in.
Could be interesting, maybe start off slow and then give him more minutes as your playoff run goes.      You don't want him to get hurt or lose confidence, but you don't want to fully sideline him. Makar got important minutes, and Caufield was pretty much the Habs offence in Vegas.
Yeah, I think the Rangers did this with Chris Kreider after BC won the NCAA championship.  It's not uncommon for guys to get a bit of a baptism by fire when they are that highly touted.  Idk about starting him tomorrow against a potentially historic Bruins team (with NJD fighting for the division) after heavy minutes last night and travel today, but I could absolutely see him starting against BUF and WAS and then playing in the playoffs.  Heck, even Owen Power came up to Buffalo last year after Michigan got beat in the tournament and Buffalo was clearly out of it then.
I would love it believe me. I’m just keeping expectations low. I don’t think the devils success this season should be riding on the hopes of a 20 year old d man in his first pro hockey games. But if he crushes it I’ll be giddy.
Also McAvoy for the Bruins!
I’m excited to see him play for sure. Him and nemec got me excited
He’s apparently been watching devils games all season to try to learn the systems before he gets here.
Makar is special though. Not saying Hughes isn’t, but Makar is Makar.
9 game slide isn’t an option. He will burn a year as soon as his ELC is signed
He fuckin boomed me
It’s a novelty troll account (check the user name), posts a few times per season over in /r/devils and times/words things so perfectly that it still gets you nearly every time. Top tier troll account.
Luke did him no favors. Whatever illness he had clearly affected him, aside from his setup on Fantilli's goal he was dreadful
I read he was puking on the bench, not sure if that’s true though
Luke-Nemec would get absolutely destroyed on their own zone  Gotta give them a Bahl or Marino partner
have you watched Nemec this year at all? He’s made tremendous strides with his game. Another off-season of training and another camp and he’ll be ready for the NHL.
That’s exactly how I have it. Then Nemec comes in when Smith’s contract is up.
He’s one of the least physical players you’ve ever seen?  What the fuck? Do you watch the games? He’s 2nd on the team in hits and plays pretty damn physical
This is an awful take. Graves isn’t coming back as Luke will be taking his spot. Siegenthaler is signed for the next 5 years on a steal of a contract and is better then graves
Gotta crack a few Luke’s to make a Jacklette
It would be glorious. Dougie'll have one more year left on his contract if Quinn decides to sign with us as a free agent.
Yes, Jack Hughes was a 2nd round pick by the LA Kings in 2021. Not sure why that would help Luke Hughes acclimate to the Devils though. He plays for Northeastern.
There’s a TJ Hughes at Michigan, but they’re not actually related
The funniest part is that the other Jack Hughes is his son.
There was also a T.J. Hughes on Michigan with him this year.  Also not related.
I like this one a lot, every year outside of his D+1 from his D-1 year and for the foreseeable future he'll have played with another Hughes. Jack with the NTDP, TJ with Michigan, Jack with the Devils.
I think the only scenario we see Quinn here is in ~10 years when he's past his prime just wanting to play with his brothers. It doesn't make sense for us to trade for him and give up a lot of assets when we already have a very deep D.
And we would never trade our Capt...
If you had a flair we'd know who you were referring too, but we will just have to assume it's the Capitals.
The canes were shit for 10 years too
I don’t think they lose access to their prospects that they already had contractual obligations with. That would be insane
Their prospects are their prospects regardless of what happens to the Wolves. They’d just be loaned under contract to other AHL teams.
Won't a guy like Wood be exactly the kind of player you'd want in the playoffs? Though the Devils have so many skilled and speedy forwards, no hitters will be able to catch up to them.
I don’t think there’s any solution other than 11-7. bahl has been solid, nobody else is coming out. miles wood is a totally useless hockey player.   hughes immediately helps with PP2 (either by playing on PP2 himself or pushing someone down to spread the wealth a bit). he’s fucking fantastic at getting pucks from the point through, that’s an underrated skill. he’d be helpful to this team already, no need to wait until next year.
Woods been decent recently. 11-7 isn’t the answer. Especially come playoff time we’ll want Wood for sure.
I'll always keep repeating this same old thing, but Makar averaged 17:44 in his 1st playoffs, and his game kept getting better & better that he was the #1 D in the last game we were wiped out, and was essentially doubleshifted for the last 10 mins of the game.      Not saying Hughes will repeat it either, but gosh Makar became my fav right from the getgo.      Hughes as a 7D would be perfect fit indeed, you're right.
I don’t think any of the hughes brothers will ever suffer from a lack of confidence. when jack was interviewed after his poor rookie season someone asked him if he believed he could still be a star (which was a dumb question in itself) and he replied “I think I can be the best player in the national hockey league.”
Sucks Casey is probably like 2 years away but I am over the moon excited for him. So high on him. Every time I watch him he generates so much offensively and is also so mistake free and great defensively. Now I’m not saying he ends up as this guy but he reminds me a ton of Fox
Those goals weren’t on Hughes imo. I can elaborate if you want from a goalie coach but if you disagree I’d love to hear your perspective.
I used to want Luke-Marino. I turned around on that. I want Marino in a heavy shutdown role like we've used him. If Bahl can handle that then go with Bahl. If he can't and Bahl-Dougie actually works then go Siegs-Marino (insanity). I think a Luke-Nemec pair could be able to work as a really sheltered pair.
I watch a lot of AHL games, he's already NHL-ready offensively/transition, but he still has issues with the timing of pressure and defending. Nothing big, just the usual for europpean players, but it could be exploited in the NHL much easier than the AHL does (the skill gap between him and the average AHL player is quite large)
He hasnt. Dude is a Jiricek fan boy. All his comments before the draft was that Jiricek is 100% the pick and there’s zero shot we pick Nemec over him. Been upset ever since. He’s always had a grudge with Nemec and has never once talked positively about him.
He's been good not great. Unless he blows you away in camp I don't see the sense in throwing him in and having both him and Luke. Let Nemec cook for another year and bring him up at the end of the year.
I mean if y’all do end up moving him I hope we can get a home-draft discount
You're mistaken. Jack Hughes is an article written by well known French author Émile Zola on the Dreyfus affair in 1898.
You have enough already. You won like 4 lottery picks in 10 years.
We're definitely not trading for him. I think UFA is an option. Quinn will be a UFA when Dougie has one year left. We'll see how things look then but I could see us moving the last year of Dougie and signing Quinn
I give it a 50/50 he signs with the Devils when he's on the last year of his current contract in 2027.  By then Quinn'll be 27, in the middle of his prime, and ready for a big 7 year contract to bring him to age 34.
Plus it wouldn’t be “a lot of assets” it would be “all of your assets”
Would that only be true as long as they had NHL contracts?  And then they would have to find another org to place them, right?  I have no idea how many of that will work.  Just an interesting situation
I’ve been saying this all year - you need guys like Wood in the playoffs. He’s big, he hits, he hustles, and generally plays a game geared toward the playoffs. And he does it on a team that is sorely lacking in that department.   If he continues to take dumb penalties and commits the same turnovers we see now then sure scratch him. But I have a feeling Wood is gonna play a big role come playoff time and it may not necessarily be on the scoresheet
No because he’s bad.
I do think there's a decent chance we go 11-7 but it probably won't be Wood coming out. Instead I think it'll be an actually useful player coming out.
He really hasn't. Wood's awful and shouldn't even be in a healthy lineup if we're running 12-6.
This has to be Wood’s burner account that he uses for crypto trading
I feel like Quinn doesn't care about what people say about him and Jack just has buckets of confidence and swagger. Granted I have nothing to back this up other than the vibe I get from them
Not the goals, no, but he gave up a lot of high danger chances
No take backs
Bien joué
Get it right. It was 11 years.
More like Smith plus future considerations.
Any player that Carolina owns the rights to won’t be affected. They can be loaned to play anywhere in the AHL. Only problem with that is Carolina would no longer have organizational control over how those players are being used/developed.
Good questions my friend
I’d rather have one less hitter than keep an absolute liability against a stacked Rangers offense. Their powerplay will be their strength in the series and Wood will hand them over on a silver platter
Shit are we going to sit Jack?
He’s basically the perfect fourth liner. Scores goals occasionally and isn’t afraid to throw punches. I don’t know why everybody hates him so much.
Yeah he's terrible and a total liability. Love him, but he's terrible. Exactly the guy you don't want in the playoffs. Sometimes you need a wrecking ball, but not one who can't control the puck, can't pass and takes the amount of dumb penalties he does. Especially if we're playing NYR, their PP is the best shot they have outside of Shesterkin imo.   Foote and Lazar can easily fill his spot on the 4th line. We'll need to roll 4 to win and 12-6 is definitely what I think we'll do. Luke can get practice time with a playoff winning team and get pumped for next year. Couldn't be more excited for him to join the team, just not yet.
I believe you mean Jon Bon Jovi
The Devils are always in the details
This is exactly how it works, I’ve watched my team change AHL affiliates twice. They also kept the head coach and general manager, so staff can move as well, it depends on the contracts.   It’s not going to be a big deal for the NHL club at all, but the AHL club is pretty screwed next season unless they replace with an affiliate.
Hugheslander. There can be only one.
His last goal was March 3rd, his last assist was March 11th, he takes a ton of offensive zone penalties, he’s king of breakaways where he somehow doesn’t get a shot on goal, and his “physicality” leads to even more penalties  He does nothing well, and the team has enough talent that he is replaceable in the lineup by the likes of Foote
Because we have better options. Sharangovich can PK, Bastian can play netfront on the PP and also is physical. Lazar when he's healthy can PK and be physical.  Wood just doesn't do much.
Sharangovich is almost as fast as wood and is shutdown defensively. I like Foote but Shango McLeod and Bastian is the best fourth line we can put together but it won’t happen
Lol, the Preds being carried to an eight seed by an amazing goalie. That’s been my entire life of hockey fandom.
Stud. Maybe Nashville can start stringing together a run of excellent goalies. Like Tomas Vokoun is terribly forgotten about, you got Rinne, and Saros. Pretty solid.
Ullmark gets the Vezina because most voters won’t be able to look past the .937 vs .918 save percentage  But if Preds make the playoffs, Saros should be top 3 for the Hart
I love Saros, he's so fucking good. To think that Nashville follows up a legendary goaltender with another one, like pulling rabbits from a hat.  As someone who didn't appreciate Hasek/Miller years enough, I hope all Preds fans cherish this man.
I could certainly be convinced that he is worthy of the Vezina.  Don't think he'll get a lot of 1st-place votes if Nashville misses the playoffs, but he should be top 3 IMO.
He’s so good he has become multiple goalies!
For all the whining and moaning I'm hearing from Leafs fans about Samsonov, seeing him in the top 10 is pretty cool.
If the preds make the playoffs (which they will IMO) he deserves a very big look at the Vezina. He is putting up these numbers on a very average, half sold-off and extremely broken team. Not to mention Saros has 14 more games played and faced nearly **600** more shots.  Now by no means am I saying Ullmark is only getting those numbers because of the team in front of him, but the Preds are a D tier team in the east at best and I don't think that fact should be ignored. He is on the weakest team of the top 5 goalies by far.
Something to keep in mind when folks argue that only 6'4" + goalies are a must have.  Saros is 5'11", or 1.8 meters for our Euro friends.
Suck it Ullmark! /s
With all the positive stories about him, sometimes I think that Saros controls the hockey media.    Yes, I am ashamed but no, I will not apologize
Top 3 goalie in the league right now.  Good for him.  No shot at Vezina, but that was locked up for Ullmark in February.
He's the reason we even have a shot at WC2
just as we all expected: Saros, Sorokin, Vasi, Shersterkin, Helly, and... Bruins??
Tank destroyer Monty 😒
Yeah and he’s making me lose my fantasy championship
Rinne mentoring Saros probably helped too. I gotta give it to Rinne for accepting that he is losing his touched so he just mentored Saros where he is right now. Happy for you Preds family
I think it was Marek that recently said he’s putting up hall of fame numbers with a goals saved above expected figure in line with that of Patrick Roy!  Incredible numbers for one of the shortest goalies in the league.
This makes me feel better about my preseason Saros to win the Vezina bet
Just here cause I'm happy to see Sam M on the list...
Is there a site that tracks save % on expected goals?   Like on this chart Soros saved 20% of the expected goals and Ulmark saved 30%. Would be cool to see how that compares to league average.
Looks like this is due to volume, his per. 60 is still well below Ullmark.
The 4 Kings goalies this year are split between top 20 and bottom 10 lol
He is the only reason I don't want to face them in the playoffs. We may have swept them this year, but nothing is scarier than a goalie that talented that is on a mission.
Love that one of the best goalies in the world is sub 6 foot, super cool that he’s still so successful in an era where massive dudes like helle can just let pucks hit them
Insane goalie + one Norris defenseman = the Nashville way
Saros in the early 2020s is living out Rinnes reality for the 2010s.
That string has already been started and theoretically if Asky pans out, which it looks like he will so far, that string could theoretically extend for another decade or more. Not bad for an expansion team that started with Mike Dunham
Nor should they look past it...
He should also be 3rd to 4th in vezina votes.
We really do, we love him so much.  And we're already getting excited about our next rabbit, Askarov.
He won’t get a lot of first place votes because Ullmark has a gaudy record. But honestly Saros has been ridiculous.
I love Saros and I think he should definitely have at least one vezina in the future, but this year it ain’t gonna happen. This year is all Ullmark
IMO there should be a crater in votes after the top 3. I could easily be convinced that Sorokin, Ullmark, or Saros deserve it (though Ullmark will win it, regardless of who deserves it). I think that the gap after those 3 is big enough (I’d consider Vasilevskiy and Gustavsson the next best contenders, and they’re a cut behind imo) that I’m not convinced someone can convince me the trio hasn’t been the 3 best.
Well if you did that to deny ullmark his then you're pretty stupid
It's a virtue signalings!
Definitely.  Currently, Nashville's forward corps almost entirely either started or spent some considerable time on their AHL team this season.  The D isn't much better with only McDonagh and Fabro being full-time NHLers.   Right now, the team is missing: Josi (D), Forsberg (F), Duchene (F), Johansen (F), Carrier (D), Lauzon (D), Parssinen (F), and Borowieki (D).   The team also no longer has Ekholm (D), Granlund (F), Niederreiter (F), and Jeannot (F).   The fact the Predators are even sniffing the playoffs right now is nothing short of incredible and Saros is central to that success.
Tbh if we make the playoffs he deserves Hart votes
The preds despite now consisting of mostly AHL players have the second best starter out of the three teams competing for the last playoff spot in the west. I think if their goaltending stays solid they will likely leapfrog the flames in the west in the end even if they don't make the playoffs.
If the Preds make the playoffs, 100% Vezina should go to Saros
Agree with a lot of this except the part about making the playoffs should be requisite for the trophy.
5’11 is a generous measurement for him too
That's pretty much what "goals saved above expected" is. The idea is that every shot has a chance of being a goal. If a shot has a 10% chance of being a goal, then you would expect the league average goalie to save it 9/10 times, and it would be worth 0.1 xG. If a goalie saw that shot 20 times and saved it 19 times, they would have a .05 goals saved above expected.
Boston only needs to let in like 60+ goals in th3 next 4 games along with like 10 other teams shitting the bed as well but yea sure there's a chance lol
Sorting by GA/G, the Bruins (2.10) are farther away from the second place Canes (2.53), than the Canes are from the 12^th place Preds (2.82)  It's absolutely insane, Ullmark and Swayman pretty much have the Jennings locked up
What do you mean "better win"? Nobody decides the Jennings, it's stats based.   Nashville is 12th overall for GA, they're nowhere close to winning the Jennings.
I wouldn’t be too concerned about facing the Preds in the playoffs this year. A goalie on a mission isn’t worth all that much if he has next to no goal support.
Indeed lol. I forgot about Asky truth be told
Started with Mike Dunham. Ellis is the post-vokoun/mason era
Also love the username! Chag Sameach to you mate.
Mike Dunham.
Ullmark has had a great year and deserves the Vezina. He’s been amazing.  Saros to this point is on a posible Hall of Fame career trajectory. Obviously, he has a long way still to go but he is still continuing to improve.  Every goalie has some variance to his game but his technical soundness and patience means there is not a lot of voodoo to his success.
Id put him 2nd at this rate
Only hesitation is how to manage having Saros and Askarov together. What a nice problem.
Wouldn’t be surprised if some voters hold Swayman playing so well against Ullmark
not that Ullmark is at all undeserving but goalie win/loss record is so dumb lol
Has Saros tried scoring more? /s
There is something funky about expected goals against Boston this year. Ullmark and Swayman are the top two in goals saved above average / 60. There’s no way those two are suddenly the two best goalies in the league and on the same team. They are both great for sure, but something is off.
Idk about that. Look at Swayman. Clearly, Boston's system and team is benefitting the goalies. Saros has played over 60 games and is absolutely carrying a team that should be in the lottery.   I agree that Ullmark should win it, but you could definitely make a reasonable argument.
Only one player deserves Hart votes this year
There’s a video out there of the Preds’ goalies doing drills. Saros is so quick, he makes the other guys look like old men.
I get that, but gsaa is a cumulative stat. I want it as a rate stat.
Bruins played this season on Rookie mode so I’m not shocked, would be nice to see at least ONE of our players win something
For me it's not that Swayman has also played well, it's just that Swayman has played a lot. Saros is probably going to finish with 65 games played to Ulmark's 49-ish, which is pretty nuts in today's NHL.  It's probably still Ulmark, but body of work is definitely part of it for me.
GMs mostly vote based on wins and the main stats. Ullmark should win easy. Especially, that he's on a east coast team to.
It’s the king felix discussion all over again
100%, and goalie record IS important, but also, Saros has been carrying an AHL team, at times
Something is off, as in the stats are wrong, or?  &#x200B;  Swayman had a rough start but he's been lights out since. Ullmark has been lights out from day 1.  &#x200B;  Just curious what you mean by "something".  &#x200B;  edit: only assholes downvote a genuine question. I really want to know what someone meant by off so I can see it myself. Stay salty though.
well, do you see how many points they have? it’s a really good team and the core has had a long time to gel together, makes sense that they play tight defense and control the puck a lot more than their opponents
Maybe a good argument sure. But not a winning argument
It is ranked voting each voter has 5 votes. Saros better get some.
What I'm saying is that an expected goal is calibrated to a league average goalie/shooter. The rate is baked in. An average goalie would allow one goal for each expected goal.
Money puck has a gsaa/60 stat
You get to play in the Central and you’re complaining that *we* played on “rookie mode”?
By that logic if Georgiev is a Vezina finalist a la 2020 Grubauer, the GMs aren’t serious
The explanation would be something like, the xG models systematically overrate the danger of certain kinds of shots Boston tends to give up more than the average team. If you couple that explanation with the goalies being prepared for and/or naturally being better at stopping those kind of shots, that would be your explanation for why the GSAA charts overrate the Boston goalies. I have to admit I am sympathetic to a version of this view, because for both goalies to go from pretty good to best-in-league seems more unlikely than the explanation I just outlined.
you can usually ignore anything using expected goals
Ullmark last season in Buffalo: 9-6 record, 2.69 goals against, .915 sv%  Ullmark first season in Boston: 26-10 record, 2.45 goals against, .915 sv%  Other than averaging 1 extra goal every 4 games in Buffalo vs Boston, tell me the difference please because .25 goals a game isn’t a difference 15-4 in record, it has to be something else... I just can’t put my finger on it
Shit your right. In that case, I agree.
Right. But one goalie might face 200 expected goals, and save 10% of them.   Another goalie might only face 100 expected goals, but he’ll save 20%.   Both those goalies will show as 20 gsaa, even though their performance is very different.
Closer, but that’s still skewed by who faces more shots.
I think they're saying that we make it look like rookie mode. I'm guessing they just worded it wrong
Grub had 30 wins.. you ignore the part where I said GM look at wins?
MoneyPuck's model gives a hige weight to rebound shots as well. Here's an example for Jeremy Swayman vs. CBJ on 12/17/22: https://moneypuck.com/g.htm?id=2022020484   BOS won 4-2, with MP's model saying that Swayman saved 4.36 goals above expected. CBJ's xG was 6.36, which is crazy high. But when you flurry-adjust it, the xG decreases to 3.64. They have Swayman's excpected rebounds given up at 2.6, but he actually gave up 5 rebounds. Of those 5 rebounds, 4 were on goal, but account for a whopping 2.3 xG. I think this is where the model contradicts itself a bit. e.g. Laine had a rebound shot that missed the net that accounted for 0.738 xG, which was then counted towards Swayman's GSAx, even though Laine's shot went wide.   Goalies who give up more rebounds accrue higher GSAx. Additionally situations are heavily weighted. Team who are trailing late in a game have increased xG per the models so goalies who play for teams who often have the lead might be favored in this stat.   All in all I really appreciate the models, but the outliers can become issues. And since it's a stat leaderboard, everyone always pays most attention to the outliers in these stats.
Thank you for the answer! That makes sense. Expected goals is such a weird stat. Do they update it throughout the season or is it set at the beginning and then whatever the difference is at the end determines the stat?
The Bruins goalie coach 'Goalie Bob' probably. He was around for Tim Thomas coming from Finland as a senior citizen and suddenly being otherworldly, he was around for Rask. Almost every backup the Bruins have had since then has also been rock solid.   This could also be systems related: the Bruins defensive system really hasn't changed too much since Julien. It wouldn't surprise me if Goalie Bob+scouting/coaching staff had a good handle on which goalies were undervalued/had fixable flaws/would work well in the Bruins system. The only real goalie misses I can think of in the past decade have been Subban and Vladar, but those were prospects.  Specifically to Ullmark and this season, he incorporated a lot more backwards movement into his positioning this season. Apparently that's the difference, I guess. Who knows, goalies are voodoo.
Some of you are trying so hard to find a reason why he doesn’t deserve it and it’s entertaining to watch unfold.   Carry on.
"Save % Above Expected" is a column on MoneyPuck's goalie page, which I think is what you're looking for. But note that MoneyPuck's GSAx for a goalie is based on the xG of the opponents "Unblocked Shot Attempts", so if a shot has an xG value and misses the net, the goalie still gets credited for that xG amount towards their GSAx. That's why the "Save % Above Expected" is the difference between "Save % on Unblocked Shots" minus "xSave % on Unblocked Shots". Ullmark, Swayman, and Saros are the top 3 in that metric. Should be what you're looking for anyway.   As an aside I don't really like the GSAx for goalies, I think it works a bit better for teams though.   https://moneypuck.com/goalies.htm
That’s exactly what I intended to say, you guys made it look so easy
I’m agreeing with you, I’m saying if Georgiev collecting wins like Grub did also gets him a Vezina nom over a more worthy candidate, the GMs lose credibility.
Expected goals have a ways to go to be perfect but definitely not useless. Different models update during the season, I’m pretty sure most public models don’t though.  When it comes to something being funky, there might be something about shot location data in Boston games (kind of like the famous Lunqdvist at MSG shot reporting) or Boston just does something defensively that makes it easier for goalies to save certain shots than they usually are.
Yes! That is what I was looking for thank you
They never had one
Okay that makes sense. Thanks for taking the time to explain it. I’m not usually a big stats person so it’s always interesting to hear.
I agree one advanced stat (and one that monitors what should have happened versus what did) is of limited use but looking at all the advanced stats paints a picture if a team pinned in their zone way too much.  One of the only area where Nashville is over 50 percent is high-danger goals for. Even though they are way underwater on HD attempts, Saros saves their ass often.
To show what I think of how good Saros has been playing lately, here’s what I commented in our GDT when we played you the other day:  “Fuck you Saros you fucking oversized tooth cat jersey wearing bastard”  This was after like his 5th ridiculous ass fucking save. Man put the team on his back. He deserves the credit.
quick opening goal  I think this goal shouldn't count, but who knows
This transfer portal thing is a lot less cool and mystical than it sounds.
He’s not even that good of a player. Dude is doing all this just to end up a healthy scratch on some ECHL team
Kicked out of 2 schools and will be 24 next season, exciting transfer target.
Can’t wait for him to get taken by a school immediately, said school to say they had talks with him about learning a lesson, he does absolutely nothing to prove he learned said lesson (actually probably does something else incredibly stupid), and a shocking amount of people on Reddit to be surprised this is how it works
Alaska Anchorage here he comes! At this point, getting dumped from Mercyhurst means he can only go to some independent team, drop down from D1, or go play FPHL or SPHL hockey if that is even an option for him next year
This is probably completely weird and nuts and probably a dick thing to say. But I swear the picture they've used of him is how I've also imagined spoiled rich kids who've never had to deal with anything look.
I just can't see too many teams being interested in dealing with the PR headache involved in picking up this guy who had 5 goals, 13 points and a -7 over 30 games for one of the worst teams in D1's worst Conference. Hopefully no team proves me wrong on that.
He should get into reffing so he can continue to piss us all off
Can we just not talk about this guy anymore?
What happened to the other kid/player who pushed the chair down? Carson didn’t do it alone
He's shown nothing resembling genuine remorse for his actions. Hopefully no other school takes him.
Damn, was hoping it was a portal straight to hell.  Better luck next time, I guess.
Might want to buckle down on the academic side, Carson.
Canadiens prospect 2024?
I hope a fly doesn’t sneak in there while he teleports.
I hope that dbag gets no offers.
Why is everyone still following this guy so closely? The story is over. Get on with your damn lives.
Probably not. He's not good enough to justify a headache and it wasn't like he got the boot from Minnesota or some top tier program, he started out at a smaller prigram (ASU being relatively newer to NCAA hockey) and went to Mercyhurst who was getting demolished this year and is a small program. Also the pool of teams is shrinking for him with D1 in NCAA also featuring a lot of schools who are lower in other sports (Ferris Stae, Northern Michigan l, and Michigan Tech for example are all D1 in hockey but D2 in nearly every other sport).
Any team would have to have a screw loose to pick this kid up. He’s been in the portal twice now. 🙄
I can’t unsee it…is he wearing eyeliner? Or am I crazy
At least it sounds sexier than "waiver wire"
Not nearly as cool as stargate
“Off to Alaska with you!”  *VOOOooooommmm*
Yeah I was hoping a court of wizards were sending him to that maze from Goblet of Fire or something.
You’re a healthy scratch, on a last place team in the SPHL, shut the fuck up Briere.
His dad was running the Maine Mariners before he got his NHL job. If Danny's even talking to him right now, maybe he could get him in there.
Sigunett you’re a healthy scratch in the NOSHO go for a soda.
If Danny could get him on an ECHL roster, he'd already be there. His problem with alcohol is well known. How does he have any eligibility left? Wasn't there a short stint in the minors between schools? You lose a year for each minor season you play.
I don't think he is nearly good enough as a hockey player for that to happen.   He was a below average player for a team that went .319 against all opponents and finished 8th out of 10 teams in arguably the worst Conference in D1 college hockey. 5 goals and 13 points in 30 games against almost exclusively mediocre-or-worse competition. What on-ice value does he bring to an NCAA team?  This is now the 2nd time he has been dismissed from an NCAA hockey program. He only has 2 years of eligibility left and the NCAA may or may not issue their own suspension if another team picks him up.   I just don't see his talent level being enough to justify the huge PR hit and potential culture issues that bringing him in would create.
You forgot the part where it is a middling school and they also get a new sizeable donation from an undisclosed party.
Oh, I agree someone will take him. I just wonder the quality of team at this point. Mercyhurst was already a jump down from ASU IMO; Who’s taking him now?
Beer league, preferably an unselective one...
As a resident of Anchorage and UAA alumnus I’m wondering if you’re using my alma mater as the butt of a joke or seriously think they’d take him on?
I think your idea makes the most sense, however, I believe it says he entered the portal explicitly for D1 teams. Which seems a fools errand though schools will do anything for “name power” and money
The media does this constantly lol. The photo selection for headlines is very strategic.
Best answer! Please accept my humble award! 🏆
But he's Brieres son so apparently not.
I believe also dismissed from their team (lacrosse?) and also entered the transfer portal
Carson did push it down alone.  Watching a drunk person do something stupid doesn’t make you a criminal
Living in Erie? Not much major news.  Working in Higher Ed? Not much major news.   A D1 athlete in Erie actually being punished for their behavior? Fairly big news for those two niches
He's not even close to good enough for the KHL lol
"Please don't stick your dick in the transfer portal... we don't know where it goes."
Indeed!
Doubt even UAA would take him.
Don’t do Alaska dirty like that. They are a decent school!
I grew up on SPHL hockey, RIP Columbus Cottonmouths
Fuck you Shoresy
I don’t think Carson Briere is that quality of player. The Mariners have Conner Bleackley on their roster and he barely plays. That’s a former 1st AND 5th rounder!
So like, you got on an airplane. Then ya landed and you didn't call your parents to let em know you got here safe?
Give yer balls a tug
Well said, also important to point out that he's 23 years old.  He's playing against 18, 19, 20 year olds and is still absolutely nothing to write home about.
I saw him play against RIT and he was just not good at all. I had to look him up because I didn't believe he could actually be Danny Briere's son.
It pretty much depends on whether his dad decides its worth spending the money on a big enough donation to get his rotten crotch spawn into a school somewhere, anywhere
Are you sure it's 2 years? Wasn't there a minor league stint between schools? You lose a year for every season
The University of Novosibirsk
Probably gonna end up playing D2, D3, or ACHA.  Due to the bad press, I highly doubt any D1 squad will take a chance on him.
Oh, such a punchable face would be great in the beer league I used to play in
There’s a few factors which would make the school a fit for him (not necessarily the other way around): a relatively newly revived D1 program, not tied to any conference which would suspend him, in a remote location which doesn’t get much media attention so his participation can go relatively under the radar
It says in the article he is suspended and still on the lacrosse team
This is actually useful information for this kid, he's done enough dumb already.
Indeed.
Even UAF has standards
Oh man the SPHL. Fayetteville Fireantz, always fun.
Fuck you, Reilly. I made your mum so wet, Trudeau deployed a 24-hour infantry unit to stack sand bags around my bed.
Fer what?
They used to have Sean Day as well. I remember seeing that he was clearly the best player on the ice but it was like... barely.
Must be big shots getting in airplanes every no calling their parents when they land.  Sooo Dumb.
Tabarnak
Too busy get jerk-offs down stream from an aqua-dump.
18, 19, and 20 year olds are the minority in NCAA hockey. The average freshman NCAA hockey player is 20. You get a handful of 18 and 19 year old NHL prospects/picks who play college at 18, a few more that play at 19, but for the most part NCAA freshman play out their junior A eligibility and then start college.   He's mostly playing against guys in their 20s.
23 in NCAA isn’t weird at all
AFAIK, he is not excluded of the college, just the sport team.  If his family have anything like a conscience  they would just let him finish his degree in that college and thats that.  Hockey obviously aint a real pro option for him anyway.
One of the years he played was a COVID season where the NCAA gave all active players an extra year of eligibility.   He was kicked off ASU during his redshirt freshman season which doesn't burn a year of eligibility. So he's burned 3 years of eligibility and gained 1 year back due to COVID.
Mitchell Miller's beer league team.
There is no such thing as D2 hockey
That’s a fair way to look at it. As it is, UAA has four non-goalies graduating and six recruits coming in so I doubt  they’re interested in taking him in. From a purely theoretical standpoint I suppose the program does make sense but knowing the coaching staff, booster club and new leadership of the team (you’re correct, this past year was their first active season back) I’d be personally shocked and saddened if he became a Seawolf
No, you’re right my bad; it was later on that other folks not-related transferred - good catch
Puck head signed my cast in 3rd grade
He had his day in the sun.
Hmm not sure that’s true. There are lots of teams with very young players. Gophers, Michigan and many more.
> 18, 19, and 20 year olds are the minority in NCAA hockey.   Not for great programs, and not for people that will make the play pro. Being 23 is not bad for NCAA hockey.  But being 23 with very public baggage and mediocre talent is really bad.
Not weird but at that point if you aren't already drafted you probably aren't going anywhere in pro hockey except maybe ECHL.
It is definitely true. Only 7 players on Michigan are 20 or younger. And they’re the youngest team in the NCAA this year.
There is not a single program where 18-20 year olds are the majority
Eh some will still go AHL or some of the better Euro leagues. Now with his stat line he’s definitely not going anywhere
That isn't how the draft works. You are only eligible at ages 18 and 19, there are players who bloom into NHL talent undrafted all the time.   That being said, this dude sucks and shouldn't play anywhere else at D1
No California Golden Seals though, what a scrub
Ovi in shambles.
Tarasenko scored, Blues win. Perfect game.
And good for him!  We miss him in StL but it was awesome to see him back last night.
Didn't know Vladimir had such a prolific goal-scoring brother
Did the Rangers consider winning though?
Never been pumped to see an old player score on us before I was on my feet!
I'm sad.
Is there anyone else who has done this?
I still can’t believe the Sens traded the Tarasenko draft pick for David Rundblad.
Or the Hamilton Tigers. What a fraud
Hasn’t even scored against Stanley Cup champions Vancouver Millionaires.
Who has Ovi not scored against?
Ehh when we are out of the running I would rather lose
There was about a 4-5 year stretch or so where only Ovi had more goals during that period.
Can’t even score against the Cleveland Barons, what a hack.
What is the connection between Hamilton and tigers?
The Caps.
They're out of the Bedard sweepstakes at this point, so I'm back to rooting for winning. If they can shore up the defense, this year should hopefully be a one off, because the offense looks great right now.
Icymi, the title
Tarasenko's the Wanderers' bitch
The Atlanta Flames haven't been scored on in decades.
I’m embarrassed… that… makes sense.  I just assumed there was another team that has somehow avoided the wrath of The Ovi Office for two decades…
Even Matthews, obviously an elite goal scorer but much younger than Ovi, has scored against every team but his own. If Ovi hadn't scored against a team in two decades I'd be shocked.  Pastrnak has also scored against every team but one, with one goal in nine games vs the Blues.   So has McDavid, Draisaitl, Kucherov, Stamkos, Kane, Kane, Toews, Kopitar, Nylander, Marner, and Crosby of course. Tavares also scored against all 32 teams.
Why are so many teams out there warming up at once?!?   Just kidding  Neato
Crosby staring you tf down
I was a season ticket holder for ~6 years and after a season, I started going down to the ice for all of the away teams warmups. was fun to see different guys pregame rituals / it was always much quieter than the devils side, obviously.
I always go for warmups regardless of the team or the league. Interesting things for me have always been  - You gain a new appreciation for how good they are. When the game is flowing, NHL hockey can often look fairly simple overall, because everyone is so good that you have to keep it simple 90% of the time or you get burned. Warmups? You REALLY see how good everyone on the ice is. Casually ripping pucks bar and in like it's the most simple thing in the world is crazy. Watching Kane stickhandling casually really makes you understand why they are who they are.  - The difference in warmups between NHL and AHL is BIG. During the Wolves warmups in the AHL finals, some guys could shoot pretty hard, they did some good stuff, but you look at the NHL and 4th line guys are just sniping pucks on the goalies. I remember Marcus Kruger blowing one by Crawfords blocker one time and my buddy and I were shocked because he has never had a shot like that in his entire actual playing career.  - Some of the skating things they do in warmups make you really appreciate these guys. Oduya on his right leg only went from goal line to the neutral zone, transitioned, and did c cuts coming back down to the goal line, without ever even moving his left leg back towards the ice. He's always been a good skater but the fluidity he did it with was remarkable.   I usually don't go down low enough to hunt for pucks or anything but I went with my ex's son and he got one from Dach, Fleury, Hardman, and Murphy in one game. We handed a couple of them out because we felt bad haha
Eakin's flow 👌
Wish I could add videos on here but I have video of Marchand just tossing pucks over the ice to kids in Chicago. Last one off the ice every time I’ve seen them warm up.
We got glass seats a few weeks ago and I caught a puck that a capitals player tossed over the glass. Gave it to a kid that was a capitals fan. It was pretty cool to see Ovechkin up close, he makes everyone else on the ice look like little boys
I wish I could. I’m a wheelchair user so that hasn’t been a possibility for over a decade, unless the arena has front row wheelchair seats and I have a ticket for one.
We did recently and Debrincat threw a puck over the glass to my kid who was wearing a Draisaitl jersey over a McDavid jersey lol Also recommend.
I got a puck that flew over the ice during warmies, so that's pretty cool
Yeah I usually do, especially if I bring my kids or a buddy who's never been before.  I took my son down there before game 2 of the scf and Frankie launched the puck off the glass from behind the net, rang around out of play and somehow smacked the photographer in the media pit square in the forehead.  Lots of blood, but he got the puck for it
I do it every time the Avs are in town. One year with my little brother-in-law we got on the Avs social media for our poster and Makar gave him a puck and first bump.
Thats such a sick shot of Sid
Best photo in the roll by far
> Watching Kane stickhandling casually really makes you understand why they are who they are.  I really appreciated this video for that particular skill: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REAqCB9vfbU  I had just gotten into hockey less than a year previous.  > I remember Marcus Kruger blowing one by Crawfords blocker one time and my buddy and I were shocked because he has never had a shot like that in his entire actual playing career.  I sometimes wonder how much a player may give up in power to gain accuracy. If your 85-mph wrist shot consistently gives you a better chance of scoring than a 100-mph slapshot, why take the slapper? I wonder if there's players in the league that have absolutely phenomenal power, but don't use it because it's more effective for the team for them to do something else.
Not the best picture I took all year but had to include the ginger mullet!
I wonder if you could ask for your birthday or something to watch from the zam entrance area or wherever the ice girls congregate at some rinks. That would be kind of cool if it's just pre-game to start a club for the differently abled fans to see warmups a bit better ice level. Maybe reach out to your team's social media or front ticketing office with the idea?
I've seen so many cool interactions between players and fans. They're not quite as locked in so they're willing to engage a little. Have a "conversation" (usually some hand signals)
Big plus! Have gotten a couple freebies
That Kane shot is pretty nice too. If only he had an actual camera, these'd be pretty stunning (pretty sure they're not allowed without a media pass though?)
I really loved this followup to that video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3B8v_ZHA10  Had me cackling.
With NHL goalies it’s about deception so with unscreened shots you absolutely give up power in some way to trick the goalie. James Neal wrote an article talking about that when he came to the stars from junior he was a big goal scorer and he came right down the slot and just ripped it as hard as he could on turco… who made a glove save with almost zero effort. He then turned around and watched Jason Arnott beat him clean from the wall basically at the top of the circle. It continued for the whole first day and had him fucked up until he realized you had to shoot differently to beat an NHL goalie who’s perfectly on his angle. My uncle was an AHL goalie and I can confirm that if you didn’t change the angle or deceive him with your eyes/upper body in some way you may as well just dump it in the corner because it wasn’t getting by him.
Would be nice, except a) my birthday is in late June and b) my local arena is Rogers Arena and the home team warms up at the zamboni entrance end (where you can get front row wheelchair seats) – but I root for the away team (usually Ducks).  Otherwise, it'd be an idea.  Although once, I did have those seats and had the opportunity to troll the Canucks pregame warmup with a smiling Ryan Kesler Ducks cutout behind the net.
Three races to watch with 2-4 games left is great.  One of Florida, NYI, or Pittsburgh will miss the playoffs.  Two of Winnipeg, Nashville, and Calgary will miss the playoffs.  There's also three teams with 56 points for last place, which seems like the race I've been watching closest.
but what happens when you add kurt angle into the mix?
It will be a fun end to the season.
Maybe Friedman and LeBrun will shut the fuck up about the play in games now.
And there's still a race for the top of the Central for additional 'jockeying' drama. Could still go to any of the 3 teams.
It's honestly an illusion. The Sabres have like a 1% chance
Jets legit went from 31-16-1 to 12-16-2 that sucks.   Calgary is still in but they have nearly 20 overtime losses, and while OTL grants you a point you don't want that many losses there.   Nashville I haven't watched them as much.   I'd rather have Calgary in because I still like hubey ! but, as long as my cats get in, I'll be happy. If not, well at least I still got a while of Playoff hockey!
I like how the West race really picked up quick with Winnipeg falling so hard.
If not Montréal, I hope Bedard ends up I'm SJ. Make the Sharks great again and win a cup.
Sabres can still surprise everybody which would put two of those 3 East teams you listed as missing the playoffs.
Our chances drastic go down
What do you mean what happens? What do you  fuckin think happens? HE WILL WIN AND HOST THE STANLEY CUP WITH A BROKEN NECK. HE HAS THE ANKLE LOCK READY FOR ANY FUCKER THAT TRIES HIM
They'd probably say that a race this close is exactly why we need play-in games. Not that I agree.
So a counter point to this though is the flames have more RW than the predators and only 3 less then the Jets. Before the shootout the majority of overtime games resulted in ties. I prefer 3 on 3 because I dislike shootout and 3 on 3 is great for viewership. But it’s a pretty bad indicator of whether or not a team deserves to be in the playoffs more. Your OT and shootout records are irrelevant when thinking about the playoffs.   But the majority of OTLs prior to the rule adaptation were just shootout losses. Just like the majority of overtime games resulted in ties prior to implementation of the shootout. Being great at 3 on 3 doesn’t suggest to me that the Jets are more deserving of a spot then the flames.  30/37 flames wins are RW 33/43 jets wins are RW. The jets have won 9 games during 3 on 3 overtime, Statistically speaking the flames are playing more game’s competitively then the jets. Hence why 22 of their games have gone to OT, while only 13 of the jets games have gone to  OT
I thought the tank was on when Preds sold at the deadline and everyone got injured, but by god these kids are fighting. It’s been fun to watch.
The sabres have to play the Canes, Rangers and Devil's in 4 nights before playing the Sens and Blue Jackets, even if they lose 1 of those games they max out at 91 points.  That would mean the Islanders and Panthers only need 2 of a possible 6 points, while the Pens would only need 3 of a possible 6 points.
I'm pretty sure you mean  You know they say that all men are created equal, but you look at me and you look at Samoa Joe and you can see that statement is not true. See, normally if you go one on one with another wrestler, you got a 50/50 chance of winning. But I'm a genetic freak and I'm not normal! So you got a 25%, AT BEST, at beat me. Then you add Kurt Angle to the mix, your chances of winning drastic go down. See the 3 way at Sacrifice, you got a 33 1/3 chance of winning, but I, I got a 66 and 2/3 chance of winning, because Kurt Angle KNOWS he can't beat me and he's not even gonna try! So Samoa Joe, you take your 33 1/3 chance, minus my 25% chance and you got an 8 1/3 chance of winning at Sacrifice. But then you take my 75% chance of winning, if we was to go one on one, and then add 66 2/3 per cents, I got 141 2/3 chance of winning at Sacrifice. See Joe, the numbers don't lie, and they spell disaster for you at Sacrifice.
Your goaltending is playing unreal!
It is a very unlikely scenario where the Sabers shock us, but a stretch of everything going their way could send them to the playoffs. They do not control their destiny but can still mathematically make the playoffs.
NOTHING MEANS NOTHING. Nothing means nothing. I'm talkin all the way to top yeah, UNJUSTIFIBLY IN A POSITION ID RATHER NOT BE IN BUT THE CREAM RISES TO THE TOP. IN MY MOMENT OF GLORY, now im living in a nightmare yeah, and I am the cream, the cream of the crop, and THERE IS NO ONE THAT DOES IT BETTER THAN THE MACHO MAN RANDY SAVAGE ON balance, off balance it doesn't matter i am better than you are yeah.
🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨
Listen. You did really really good here. But it's  SACKERFICE
I'm still amazed Scott Steiner got all the numbers right...
Also, doesn’t he pronounce it “s’more joe” at one point? 😂 I might be remembering wrong
Lol he calls him Smo Joe and Senor Joe at one point lmfao   For those who haven't seen it  https://youtu.be/msDuNZyYAIQ
98 points on the season. 25 more than the 2nd most by a defenseman.
Vintage
That pass was filthy
Karlsson haters in denial this year.
Untank commander EK.
this play was great, but don't look at Colorado's goals.  even the shark announcers were blaming Karlsson for poor defense on 2 (at least one for sure).
More assists than the 2nd defenseman has points. And Karlsson also has the most goals.   Gretzky-esque.  Other amazing stats:  * Karlsson leads the league in ES points (tied with MacKinnon, one point ahead of McDavid)  * Karlsson is only the third defenseman after Orr (four times) and Coffey (three times) to reach 70 ES points
The pass was good, the skating was completely filthy.
>Karlsson haters  Who tf can hate Karlsson??
Noooo but his +/- is bad which means he's trash!!!
Imagine if the Sharks PP didn't suck complete ass and he actually got some more points there lol
There's a fair few Sharks fans who blame our current woes all on Karlsson. Even thought the issues we have all stem from Doug Wilsons last few years in charge.
I do from a hockey perspective. I know nothing about his personality though
In fairness games like this likely don’t change anyone’s opinions of him on either side lol   I saw a bit of why anyone thinks anything about him. Very active offensively and made an amazing plays, and he was pretty not great on the three Avalanche goals he was present for.    I choose to believe it was great sacrifice for his team, like a shot block when you’re trying to win, but he’s trying to help them lose and get him a superstar center.
Goalie for the Giants Jesper Vikman (VGK - 2020 #125) made twice as many saves (62) as Blazers goalie Dylan Ernst (31)... helluva game with a weak blue line in front of him.
All of the teams I was cheering for got swept in the CHL.
Zelley frickin celly!!!
I was at the game, Giants played their best hockey of the season in the third (Ty Thorpe with a hatty!) but Kamloops is and was too good. 1.5s left on the winner and the 3rd goal in the first period too. Honzek and Vikman had great games as well for the Giants, can't wait to see where Honzek goes in the draft!  Shoutout to the Blazers fan with the big flag who had to be escorted to his seat by security because he was blocking a t-shirt toss. Guy was downing beers like they were water and waved the flag the whole time, gotta admire the dedication.
im so fucking excited for zellweger next year
Let's go Lööps!!!
I'm a jalifax fan but live on Cape Breton so was conflicted with that series but obviously halifax swept cape breton lol
Congratulations expansion bros, welcome to the playoffs!!!!
Seattle and Arizona clearly don’t like each other
#[SUPREME VICTORY!  THE KRAKEN ARE IN THE PLAYOFFS!!  H I S T O R I C ! ! !](https://youtu.be/nycHrytF7LU)
#FOR THE FIRST TIME IN VEGAS GOLDEN KNIGHTS HISTORY, THE KRAKEN ARE GOING TO THE PLAYOFFS!!
What did we do to deserve that broadcast crew on our first playoff clinching game?!
HEY HEY WHADDYA SAY
Stanley Cup Playoffs!!!!! Here We Come!!!!
..for those of you who doubted we'd get here this year :   # EAT MY ENTIRE HAIRY IRISH ASS!!!
The drought is over!😭
PLAYOFFS BABY
Experience Kraken playoffs, baby!
SEATTLE IS PEAKING AT THE RIGHT TIME
Thats Kraken Hockey Baby!!!
All is right in the Seattle sports world!
HISTORIC
Congrats Kraken Bros! 👏
Imagine if Seattle wins out these last few games and overtakes LA?
Don't wanna get too far ahead of ourselves, but its gonna be pretty funny if our first ever banner to hang is "Central Division Champions"
Congratulations!  It's a great feeling, isn't it?
Congrats Jordan Eberle and some other dudes!!
You could put Leah next to forslund and I legit think I’d rank it bottom 5 in the league, that’s how bad she is
I’m so hoping the last two games of the year set the stage for a knights/kraken 1st round.
I really hope we see you in the playoffs. Love you expansion big bros!!
Arizona doesn't like anyone this year
Just brewing that division rivalry Leah mentioned, never mind that you took our spot in the pacific
Dry the wets   Wet the drys
PLAYOFF DUCK
That's quacken hockey baby!
#H
A year ago both our teams had their worst seasons in our histories look at us now.
I absolutely do not want to play Edmonton, thanks.
I’m just here for the chaos of this final week.
I bought the more expensive items at Taco Bell after the game. I got the slutty crunchwrap and the cinnamon twists.
Almost a uh, historic feeling?
I prefer a garbage disposal full of nails to her talking
I'm not! Always best to win your conference, and go into round one against a team that's already limping!
I honestly think the roster construction and coaching under Armstrong and Tourigny is directly responsible for this and for the success of our playmakers (Keller, Schmaltz, Maccelli).  For years the Coyotes were soft as shit.  Teams would bully Keller, Schmaltz, and Garland and nobody would do anything.  They couldn’t do things they do now because people would take runs at them and keep them outside.    People make fun of O’Brien’s fight prowess but simply having someone that if you cross check one of our skill guys will come after you even if he’s not going to beat you up, still make you have to answer, is an effective deterrent.  Then to him we add players like Ladd(see Trenin fight defending Keller), both Ritchie brothers, Josh Brown, Boko, Mackey(not great but will throw), Kassian, and then if need be Crouse.  It opens up alot and also lets Crouse focus on getting points instead of having to be the one person who protects guys.
We'll be in the Central for the playoff bracket.  That count?
^^&M
It is so crazy for two historic franchises. What a time to be alive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Yd3lQVbkYc
Well if you guys overtake LA, that would require you to beat Vegas twice. Which probably means that we overtake Vegas
The nails might be more knowledgeable
She Galaxy brained us all
I'd be ok with that scenario. Win or lose a Vegas-Seattle series builds the rivalry ahead of the Winter Classic next season.  Alternatively, if we beat Vegas both times, that could allow Colorado to overtake them and win the conference, meaning Vegas would play the WC1 team if they held on to the Pacific lead.
at least they have a point
I’m curious to see how it all plays out in terms of the matchups Kinda want some surprises.
That was a rather sharp remark.
The best part about this is John Forslund getting to call playoff hockey for his own team again.
THE DROUGHT IS OVER!
the fact that it only took a year to get in the playoffs without overspending on the deadline is a good accomplishment in terms of managing the team's assets
Our long suffering franchise finally catches a break!
*THAT'S KRAKEN HOCKEY, BABY!*  Now to take down the Central!
Mariners make the playoffs, Seahawks make the playoffs, Kraken make the playoffs, man.. not too shabby a year for the Evergreen State. Congrats Kraken! Enjoy some Rainiers for me tonight  Edit: my apologies to the Sounders, the Storm, the Thunderbirds, Huskies, Seawolves, the Rain City Jacks, Sea Dragons, and whoever else I omitted.
AGGGGHHHHHHH I'M GOING TO THE FIRST KRAKEN HOME PLAYOFF GAME EVER!
SAY THE LINE, BART
Thats Kraken Hockey Baby
For the first time in Vegas Seattle Golden Kraken Knights history!
#WE'RE COMING MOTHERFUCKERS
Call that shit marshawn clynch
This is the first time in my lifetime I’ve seen the Kraken make it to the playoffs. Crazy.
What a year for Seattle sports! Mariners, Seahawks, Kraken, even the Sounders winning the CONCACAF championship was big!   Let’s go Kraken!!!
From the depths of the standings last year to the base of the playoff mountain. Thank you Everett Fitzhugh https://twitter.com/KrakenAudioNet/status/1644214499128520706?s=20 if anyone wants to hear it
#SEA  #US  #MAKE THE PLAYOFFS
Really happy for the team and the fanbase to get a playoff birth so early in their history. It's gonna be a fun time inside climate pledge I hope.
That’s 🦑🏒👶🏻
Seattle sports right now…
Must be nice...
Squids, welcome to the wild thunder dome of the Stanley Cup Playoffs!
U N P R E C E D E N T E D
I love how good Seattle is in general to get to the playoffs regardless of sport these days… for instance, we are on top of Major League Rugby of all sports
That’s kraken hockey baby!
*excited splashing noises*
congrats kraken fans!! fun starts now!!
It's been a long road. Fear the Squid
I'm just randomly getting to all 32 barns, and lucked into this historic game tonight. It was absolutely fucking awesome, and the fans up in 212 were great.
Fuck I'd love to see a Canucks Kraken playoff game. I hope it happens some day.
#💙🦑🎉💙🦑🎉
UNLEASH THE KRAKEN!
My hot take: Seattle is making it to the conference finals.
Damn, before Buffalo?
Let's fuckin GOOOOOO
So epic
#WE HERE NOW TIME TO SNATCH THE CUP
ITS THE FIRST TIME IN VEGAS GOLDEN KNIGHTS FRANCHISE HISTORY THAT AN EXPANSION TEAM HAS MADE THE PLAYOFFS!   **HISTORIC**
SAY THE WORD
I LOVE THEM SO MUCH 😭💗
Let no joyful voice be heard! Let no man look up at the sky with hope! And let this day be cursed by we who ready to wake... the KRAKEN!
Congrats to the Kraken on making the Playoffs in only the 2nd Year of existence. Also seeing all Seattle sports teams make the playoffs this season as well.   Kraken came into the league last season seeing that unlike Vegas and their historic run in the inaugural season, Seattle went the traditional route and struggled out of the gate. But this season was a different story and since they had the same rules that Vegas got for their expansion, it was gonna be sooner that Kraken would make the playoffs and what a achievement in only the 2nd year of existence.
First time in Golden Knights history, no less!
With the the Kraken clinching, all 32 teams (the current and only 32 teams) have officially made the playoffs at some point in their history as well as the 21st century.  That's Hockey Baby!
#H
So proud
Congrats kraken bros. Can’t believe they have a chance to beat out la for the third spot in the pacific. Give me kraken avs first round all day tho
As a near term suffering Wings fan, I want to see the biggest giant ginormous squid ever smuggled into an NHL arena and fired onto the ice at the first puck drop. Or what was this mascot name really all for?
Whatever they do from now on... they've done as well as the Leafs have in decades.
Do it for the cephalopods! 🐙🦑
Can we win a playoff round b4 the Maple Leafs is the question?!
First time in golden knights history
Niiice, the playoffs are going to be interesting lol.
You gotta love seeing a team make the playoffs after being a complete dumpster fire last year
This is great for Seattle. This is also amazing considering that their two main starting goalies have save %'s of .892 and .886
Something something Vegas Golden Knights franchise history.
Is it their first in golden knights history though?
Congrats and fuck you.
Congrats
The rise of the Kraken starts now!
 do we do the historic thing or is that only reserved for the Vegas Golden knights
You mean....for the first time in Vegas Golden Knights franchise history??
Welcome to the big leagues boyos
Omg, what a surprise! How joyous.
Making history
IT WAS GLORIOUS TO SEE LIVE!!!!! thanks 😊
Whoooo Hoooo!
What a feeling!
Go Krak Go!
H I S T O R I C   I   S   T   O   R   I   C
For the first time in Vegas Knights history, the Seattle Kraken have made the playoffs.
The Kraken have clinched for the first time in Golden Knight history
Rooting for The Jordan Eberles!
Historic!
H I S T O R I C
H I S T O R I C
The boyhood dream!!!!
Congrats!
It’s going to get so loud in the CPA when someone scores a goal.
Totally misread that as “Seattle Karens“!
Lol "first time in franchise history"  Yeah, two years is such an extensive time period.
And you even had 1/3 competent commentators for your game last night!
So proud
Congrats to you I-5 bros, even though I dislike you guys, I still have respect for you guys and I am happy you guys are in the playoffs. I am a big Seahawks fan lmao
Took long enough.
 They made the postseason, before the Maple Leafs won a playoff series. Wow.
How do the Kraken succeed in not being as insufferable as the Knights?
As long as Seattle gets the cup before Vegas…
And then they have to play a healthy Avs team round 1 lol
I don't think the Sabres will ever make the playoffs ever again.
I would not have bet on that after their expansion draft. Truly impressive stuff.
Congrats Kraken fans!
Such a long wait. So happy for the fans.
LETS GOOOOOO
HISTORIC
Congratulations, you are in for a treat.  Nothing in sport compares to playoff hockey, the only sad thing is it makes regular season hockey seem bland.
Many thanks to the Winnipeg Jets historic slide.
Cries in Winnipeg Jets
Congrats Kraken and fans, well done.  Now prepare to die ☠️
HISTORIC!
For the first time in Vegas Golden Knights history...
Hooray another team surpasses mine in every way, shape and form
Meanwhile our drought continues and I’m told to “trust” the Yzerplan
Any tips for the Red Wings?
Wow, finally. I was starting to think it would never happen.  For real though, I’d laugh so hard if Seattle gets a cup before the Leafs make it out of the first round.
Stoked. Very surprised Chris Driedger is still in the AHL though...
I was so mad that he didn't get to call the game tonight
The Dream Lives
Hey Lloyd!
That year of darkness was really hard for a lot of Seattle fans. It can be really difficult to see the light at the end of the tunnel when the tunnel is so short that the light from the start of the tunnel is still there
H I S T O R I C
Light the beam
Hey hey whaddya say!
BIG DUMPER DOES IT AGAIN  I don't know what exactly he did but I'm all for it
haha [starts sobbing uncontrollably]
I think the team had more talent than their record last year, just took time to gel, plus Marty Beniers is so fucking dope
For sure. I don’t think Hakstol will get coach of the year but I hope he at least gets to be part of the conversation. Pretty impressive what he did.
Not having any major injuries was a good plan also.
Did someone say 'trade for eichel'?
Managing to pull Bjorkstand (42 points this season), Tolvanen (27 pts), and Sprong (43 pts) for a total expenditure of a 3rd & 4th was a coup for Ron Francis.
50% of the league makes the playoffs and every new modern franchise is built to be at least average from the start. This tracks.
Well, I’m certainly not bitter about VGK or SEA’s early success 😤😕😢
Well expansion teams are given a competitive roster right off the bat for a reason.  Also being better than half the league after the new rules really isn't too hard when 6 teams are actively tanking every year
The new expansion draft set-up makes it pretty easy to be competitive right out the gate. Vegas made the playoffs in half the time you slackers
In Ron We Trust
Strictly speaking, it's been 103 years since a Seattle hockey team made the Stanley Cup playoffs
It was an honor to share that playoff drought with you guys.
So many bandwagon fans though, they probably couldn't even tell you the name of a player from before last year 🙄
Jee. If only these young new expansion teams like the bruins and rangers had these amazing backstories leading up to this year's playoffs.
"Sigh..." - CBJ Fans
A NEW HISTORIC MOMENT IN VEGAS GOLDEN KNIGHTS HISTORY!!!
Vegas moment
Take down every division, we're totally going all the way.
Sounders CONCACAF too!
We’ve come to a place where the Sounders have the longest playoff drought in the city. That’s nuts.
Seawolves made it all the way to the MLR Championship and are 6-0 this season.  Thunderbirds are a WHL juggernaut and swept their first round series.
Huskies football won 11 games and beat Texas in the Alamo Bowl and finished ranked in the top 10
Between losing the Sonics and most of the Mariners/Seahawks history, we've suffered a lot. I'm trying to enjoy this era while it lasts
I know most aren’t excited, but they will be my go-to-fan for the Major League Cricket team (though I question this. It makes sense for San Fran, LA, Dallas, DC, and New York to have one. But Seattle surprises me).  Seattle has sports for everyone.
Do not forget about the Seattle Thunderbirds Whl team
meanwhile sonics fans be like: just end me now
The T-birds also swept the rockets in the first round of the playoffs in the dub.
Just need to get the Supersonics in and that's a good year for Seattle
The Seattle Sea Dragons are also doing pretty well in the XFL.
One of the things I miss the most about the PNW are Rainier beer bottles. Love the little riddles under the cap.
Also omitted the rain city bitch pigeons
And our WHL team, the Seattle Thunderbirds are making a run at the Memorial Cup right now!
I am a big Seahawks fan, so I was overhyped of them making the playoffs.
How’re the prices looking
DENTAL PLAN

woozle wuzzle?
For the first time in…   *are we still doing this?*  Seattle Kraken History!
HISTORIC
Golden Krakens would be such a rad name for a band
H
It's actually the Golden Kraken!  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
I know i did.
Get busy winning, or get Kraken
oh I am so fucking envious I didn't think of this earlier!!! You know he's an owner right? lol
They’ve never made it before in my life either. Crazy.
But this is not Seattle's first chance to compete for a Stanley Cup.
Controversial opinion: Playoffs>no playoffs
Washington Huskies going 11-2 as well
It is fucking wild reading these comments after what this sub was like for the Knights in the very first years.
I’d trade all of them making it for one title but damn is this still fun. Feels like we just had mariners and the hawks in the playoffs and now back in another, this is sweet
"Worst" team in the region has only missed the playoffs once ever and won a Continental Championship that year to make up for it
For what it's worth I hope you get Bedard. Just keep him out of the Pacific please.
I'd kinda like to watch that team but I don't have any way too
That’s so cool!
That's epic, glad you had a good time!
How long do we have to wait for you?
We can give you the salty answer or the optimistic answer. Either way, we’re all happy with what the future holds regardless of the playoffs this year
Hey there’s still an… infinitesimal chance… right!?!
Pork chops
¡Histórico!
If that isn’t their goal song it should be at least the entrance theme. I mean Jerry Bruckheimer is your owner.
#.
You mean there's more than just making the playoffs?
You'll make the WCF before they win a round
Probably.
Everyone on the team can score so it kinda makes up for it. If Grubauer gets hot, look out.
hey, thanks man
The first thing that must always be asked. How does this accomplishment pertain to the Vegas Golden Knights?
HISTORIC
Yeah, but last year they didn't, so this year is the first time in franchise history.
The first time in Las Vegas Golden Knights History!
He's in what, the second or third season in charge? He didn't win a Cup overnight in Tampa either.
Seattle better do something incredible in the playoffs to merit a historic call for John.   It doesn’t *have* to be a game 7 double OT goal over the Avs, but… that couldn’t hurt…
ESPN needs to A) get rid of Leah Hextall, and 2) quit taking Kraken games.
And that Hextall did.
They’re going to the playoffs
Do some delivery!
😂
Underrated comment
First time in Golden Knights history
Upvote! Was waiting for some of the VGK throwback
wish they were the Sonics instead
I noticed Leah did an homage to the Hey Hey Waddya Say call on Matty's goal last night. Not the biggest Leah fan but that along with the Shoresy reference both got me enjoying the ESPN broadcast more than usual.
The goaltending went from historically awful to average to below average. Lot of steps forward on offense too, but that’s really the whole explanation.
My first NHL jersey purchase was a Beniers, this season
Francis also did a great job. People gave him an incredible heap of shit for not doing more during the entry draft, but what he did in the offseason and with free agency was amazing.
I always thought Hakstol was a crap coach but now I think maybe it was just the Flyers.
I'm not sure how much of it was Hakstol and how much of it was adding in a couple of young superstars. Kraken won the lottery with Beniers - you can track the improvement to when he started playing with them at the end of last year. It's a very different style of play that was not coached by Hakstol.   The power play setups do not inspire a lot of confidence in Hakstol's ability.
These are the cold hard facts I come to reddit for!
Three cheers for the Metropolitans!
Checked the Metropolitans on wikipedia to remember how Seattle had a team that long ago and accidentally discovered a different insane thing:  > The day the 1919 playoffs began, star center Bernie Morris was arrested and jailed at Fort Lewis for draft evasion, despite being a Canadian citizen.
Curse broken. 16-0 coming up
Started from the bottom now we here
This felt way longer than the Mariners playoff drought.
For first time in Vegas Golden Knights history!!!
Leafs could never (well for another 50 years anyway)
I'm guilty of that, honestly. Didn't even watch the team at all before last season
Luke Henman 😉
I know y'all had Gio and we love him here in Toronto. And...Jared McCann?
That’s the attitude; believe in believe!
Everyone seems to forget about our two successful sports teams: the Sounders (MLS men’s soccer) and the Storm (WNBA women’s basketball).   It makes me so sad as a Sounders fan - they’re out here breaking records and most everyone talks about how we don’t have any really successful sports team 😢
And OL Reign won the NWSL shield!
They need to take that name back to the workshop I’m afraid.
Seawolves are our Rugby team right?   Man I wish Rugby was more popular in the states. Such a much more interesting game than football
Yeah Mariners were fucking rough there for a while. A long while
Go Seattle Orcas!
A lot of people from India work at Microsoft, it's a sizable community.  (Probably the other major tech companies as well).  I too am super excited for cricket!
Is MLC going to be T20? I haven't read much about it but I love cricket
At least we get to see ‘The Glove’ on the twins during home games 😭
Same. Lived out there a few years back, still have a little Rainier air freshener hanging up in my car. Loved the riddles, National Rainier Day was always a blast, and I have a soft spot for those Christmas cans.
I think they discontinued the riddles in 2021 along with the other brands that did them, Natty Boh and Lonestar. All are owned by Pabst. One of the rebuses had a noose image, which caused all of them to be pulled for "reevaluation" after a social media uproar.
Well I mean that’s who the post is about!
First round was the same price as regular season for season ticket holders. Opening sales for general public today, probably already sold out. I'm not sure what they were charging. No after market tickets showing yet. I'm guessing $200 - $250 to get in the door for the first home game.  Edit: tickets are up on ticketmaster now. $300 for the cheapest.
I'm a STH, so I opted in, and 1st round is same price, 2nd is 25% above cost, 3rd is 50% over vost, and SCF are 100% over cost.  Truthfully, not bad prices, and we only pay for the games we actually get to attend.

Yes hence the joke.
Big, if true
They should've been in the Rose Bowl!
I think the difference is that Seattle properly sucked in their first season. I imagine watching a team go to the finals their first season when other fans still haven't seen their team make even conference finals would be annoying lmao
I feel like most people were on board with Vegas that first year when they were scrappy overachievers, it wasn’t until after that that they became so dislikable
Plenty of people were rooting for the Knights in year 1. The problems started later on I think as the trades got more and more chaotic.
At least we’ll for sure make it this year unless injuries hit again. Last year was a bit of a fluke injury wise for the Sounders
And away from Chicago... (shudder)

... no? I mean Buffalo might make it but Seattle clinched first
I don't think there is otherwise we'd have done it by now surely.
It doesn’t.  Not at all.  But during the Knights inaugural season the announcers / sports media went crazy over all of the “first time” things that happened to the point where it became a meme here.
I will accept this scenario!!
I'm excited to hear a few spirited "HEY HEY!! WHATTA YA SAY!!" exclamations.
Hey, WTF man.  I thought we were disaster bros.
Yeah I would take that
HEY NOW HEY NOW HEY NOW
For the truck
this is the biggest mystery -- goaltending this year is just as bad as last year.  last year they allowed 258 goals, this season, 232 with 4 games left -- pretty close.  BUT -- last year's save percentage was .890 and this year it's.... .889.   They are allowing a lot fewer shots 2341 last year vs 2069 this year
Didn’t the Kraken have metrics that indicated they were better than their record last year but a) bad goaltending and b) horrible power play got to them bad?
There weren't any serious dance partners at the time of the expansion draft, but all the trades that should have been made then were done at the trade deadline last year.
There were a handful of people trying to make sense of the expansion draft choices, talking about RF playing the long game and not the all-in strategy that Vegas went for.   It obviously worked out, as here we are.   Shows there are multiple ways to make the new expansion draft rules work in your favor, and that the idea behind the new rules seems to be working.
Francis is one of those that plays the "long game" in team success - and so far it seems to be working in Seattle.  Can't say the same for his tenure in Carolina, where he was conservative and patient to an absolute fault. You can only say "hey guys we're improving" and "any time now I swear" before people starting getting pissed off that you've always been finishing in the bottom ten.  Some of his expansion draft picks were... puzzling at the time (to the say the least!) but so far things have mostly worked out.
Grubauers contract is nowhere near amazing. Neither is Schwartz contract either. Def made some good moves but not without its misses
Yeah, we're great at 5 on 5. But our power play is a weakness. It's one of those "Can we just decline it?" Situations.
I honestly think it was just time. The players needed more time to create a bond and spark the chemistry.
Foreign citizen does not enlist in our army? Straight to jail.
You guys have been through so much. Nice to see the tides shift.
Yeah I don't think I'd go that far
Just make up a name that sounds like a 3.5 line dman. Either go aggressively Russian or Midwestern porn star. Even the most devoted fans can be gaslit into believing that Vladimir Borchenko or Dusty Clarkson were in the squad for a bit a couple years ago.
Love watching one of Jimbo’s worst trades blow up in our face.
We've got some guy named Ted Lasso working on special teams.
It's such horseshit from the boomer-controlled media. The Sounders are a big team in this city and deserve much more than the media coverage they do get (which is still way more than many MLS teams, sadly).
You’re forgetting the Reign (NWSL women’s soccer); they just won the NWSL Shield!
Hopefully the Sonics will come back soon, too.
I mean, that’s why Minnesota has such a long championship drought- don’t count the Lynx!
No way, I thought OL stood for Orlando.
To be fair to the Sounders they did win Champions League last year.
They are! You should go to a game, they're pretty fun down at StarFire!   Reikert Hattingh and AJ Alatimu are my favorite players along with Pite Lopeti
It’s baffling to me that it isn’t. It’s everything the NFL tries and fails to be. Maybe rugby needs to up their CTE or career-ending injuries.
Yeah like from when I was 15 to when I was 36 lol.
I just hope it’s on a channel I can watch, like ESPN+.
I think it will have to be. I do love ODI and T20. I know we can’t do test matches.
I wonder if it’s regional. Pabst still does the playing cards and I had a few lone stars last weekend all with the riddles, still.
Oof that hurts the wallet. But I’m hoping they have good swag to keep for memory
Yea I think I paid about 125% over for the last game of SCF last year

If you made it over us, I wouldn’t have an issue. But I can’t believe you lost to ASU (well I can, desert voodoo).
I also imagine there’s a fair bit of gatekeeping with Seattle being a more “traditional” market and Vegas being in the desert.
I said it in a different comment but that's straight up revisionism. The "they haven't earned the right to win" and "they were gifted a team" shit was everywhere even during that first season.  Now that salt just morphed into people acting like they've been personally slighted by the player management decisions of a team they don't even root for.
Nah the "they haven't earned the right to be good" and "they were gifted a great team" was out in full force even that first year.  That is still going on but it has gotten a bit better in the last two years.
Yeah, I'd much rather he come to the Ducks or Sharks than Chicago. Fuck all of that.
Oh shit, good to know, thanks
> Buffalo might make it  That's obviously what he was saying
We are, I’m just referencing how the Bunch of Jerks Canes knocked off the reigning champion Caps.   >!Listen, just let them win in game 1 in OT, let everyone have some fun, then close your jaw on their necks. Win-Win for everyone. Luv you disaster buddies!<
Are you kidding me?
This what dreams are made of.

My impression is that it's a consistency issue. Gru has a high ceiling, but a low floor.  https://www.espn.com/nhl/player/gamelog/_/id/5657/philipp-grubauer
Last year Grubauer was -33 on goals saved above expected. This year as a team we’re at -8.
Success can sometimes be in spite of the people in charge. Francis definitely messed up the expansion draft, although not horrifically. I'm happy for them it didn't set them back too much.
Some of the things he got flipping expansion draft picks ended up making him look like a mad genius. Our back-and-forth trades with the Caps come to mind. I have no idea why their GM tolerated that bullcrap.
Schwartz took an injury. It's tough to make that call without the benefit of hindsight.  Grubauer, yeah. That one was rough, but it was also right after his Vezina contender season. If it hadn't been the Kraken, someone else would've overpaid.
The drought is over!
half our franchize history is a long time
Dude Vlady was clutch in our mid March streak last year. I can't believe people act like he wasn't.
Well yeah I mean it's hard to forget those guys
Thankfully it's not Led Tasso
I mean, I'm not a boomer and I still don't know a single person who knows or cares about professional soccer or women's basketball
For what it’s worth, I blame having the games exclusively on Apple TV+ as one of the reasons I haven’t been watching this year.
I went to my first game last year and it was SO much fun!! I also really enjoyed how much more casual everything was compared to T-Mobile and Lumen. The players are right freaking there too! It’s a lot easier to appreciate the sheer size and athleticism when they’re three feet away.
Just looked and it is T20

That one loss definitely bit the Huskies in the ass! For some reason they never play great in the desert.
Yeah there were some people like that especially as the Knights went deep in the playoffs, but I think most people were excited to see Vegas doing well so unexpectedly during the regular season at least. It was a huge story in the NHL and sports in general.
Love you too
Sorry I'm high as fuck
im tearing up
Is this the hype train?
He ruins the moment, should have let the crowd take over at that point.
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT!?
Oh no r/mariners is leaking
Dave Sims is a treasure
I defended RF and still do to this day. I think the conservative route was his game all along and I firmly believe this was his plan, but that it turned around quicker than even he expected yes.   Vegas went all in, all chips in the table for an instant attempt at glory and it nearly paid off, but unless a fair amount of luck transpires they are going to hit the reset wall much faster that the Kraken will. Teams went full defensive and conservative mode this time around and basically all back door dealings were shut down so RF had to take a much slower/burning approach.   He didn’t go all in on big names in hopes of some instant magic, he got a set of decent core pieces that needed some space to thrive and gave them that. Also providing some veteran presence to help facilitate the transition on the ice.  Where I **do** think he went wrong was assuming that the D pieces would mesh right off the bat. Although he didn’t say it, it was expected Kraken would atleast start off with a strong D, and that was greatly proven otherwise, even up til recently the D has been a soft spot in the team.
He didn't mess it up at all.  He made a ton of smart picks and avoided overpaid contracts that eventually allowed him to sign Burakovsky and perform highway robbery nabbing Bjorkstrand and Tolvanen for essentially nothing.  They underperformed in the first season due to all kind of factors working against building team chemistry but that eventually led to them drafting Wright so I'm not going to complain much about that.  Everything came together this season.  I don't know why people have such a hard time zooming out from individual picks to see the bigger picture of roster construction and cap management.  He was always playing the long game and it's all there for anyone to see two years later.
He clearly didn’t mess up
The Mariners drought was pretty close to half the life of the franchise too though.
What about Sergi McKinney? That guy was on fire.
Yeah, Seattle born, raised, and currently residing (plus definitely not a boomer), and the Hawks, Mariners, Kraken, and UW football all have more general fan support than the Sounders do.
Probably a regional thing. Here in the PNW soccer is a lot bigger.
I too am not a boomer, but I do know a single person who's into pro soccer or women's basketball.
Not sure why the downvotes. Simple stats on viewership confirm you're probably very correct about your group. Not big draws for either of those two examples in this country. Is what it is.   I too know nobody that cares about either, except one dude that watches the World Cup in my group.   Not every sport is interesting. I also don't give two flying fucks about baseball, football, the Olympics, or anything much other than the NHL, AHL, CHL and horse racing. None of the rest matters to me. I don't bandwagon when my local other sports teams win shit. I don't care.
Well if you're in Colorado that's probably because the rapids suck and nobody talks about them, and there's no WNBA team
r/mls doesn't want to hear this but starting 95% of your games at the same time on a paywalled streaming service just can't be good for the growth of the league.
Oh I meant the free shit they give in the arena. From the last few years I have a bucket hat, light up wristband, custom beer bottle, and a scarf

How is Washington supposed to be this year. Defense improved?   Utes schedule this year is very brutal.
Casuals were happy with us, but it was absolutely vitriolic here.  I vividly remember, the way this place reacted to the Jets winning game one of the WCF you’d think the Jets just won the Cup.
Simms gonna Simms
Let Simms and Blowers live a little!
It was plouffe not jomboy
Supreme Victory duck has bridged us long ago (last season)
We're everywhere...
I love it when the Dave Sims deep cuts are busted out.
I'm not ragging on him for going for things like Dunn over Tarasenko; playing it safe isn't a bad move, and neither is giving yourself as much cap flexibility as possible. Those things were smart and being completely free of anchors is going to help Seattle get to the top unimpeded.  The big problems were that often let too much value on the table for absolutely no reason, the worst being the Chicago and Columbus picks, and that all that cap space he was supposed to be weaponizing ended up doing nothing.  He has done a great job since; his sells over their first year gave them a lot of capital, and all those picks give them value and opportunities to keep getting better. They are doing things the traditional way and that's fine.  People itt are really acting like criticism is because they weren't immediately good like Vegas, when he made multiple universally panned moves, and more often, lack of moves.
Wait… holy shit… I thought I already heard all the depressing things about that drought but that’s a new one.
talm bout sirguy macknee b? nice guy, never meddum
We're not even gonna talk about Connor mCconnorchecks 5 game point streak?
Cool dude  They're niche sports, it's fine if you're into them, but it's not a boomer conspiracy keeping them off tv lol

Simms was fine imo, talking about Blowers contribution.
Me too. I feel like we have pretty similar interests.  Hey one of these days me you are gonna lead an expedition on Mt Rainier!!
How can you say "All that cap space he was supposedly weaponizing ended up doing nothing" when he deployed it on Burakovsky, Bjorkstrand, and Tolvanen?  Opportunities to deploy it during season one didn't materialize so he held on to it and it paid off big.  The latter two were highway robbery and that doesn't happen if he takes overpaid multi-year contracts in the expansion draft.  I don't think the Chicago and Columbus picks were bad at all.  The exposed talent on those teams weren't worth their contracts or weren't good enough to bump other people off the roster so they'd just be dead cap space.  There wasn't anything of significantly more value to the Kraken to take from those teams.  The only obvious thing I'd wish he'd done in hindsight is take Ghost and flip him for the picks the Coyotes gave up but that's about it.    I disagree that he "left too much value on the table for absolutely no reason".  The reasons made sense at the time and they still do if you consider long-term cap management, short term roster management, team chemistry, etc.
Didn't he have a half brother as back up goalie?   Clive Rainoffski-connorcheck?
`>pro soccer`  `>niche sport`
You do realize soccer is the most popular sport in the world right?

You keep thinking that
This is by far my favorite Sims moment
I don’t think it is fair to constantly bring up tolvanen as if that wasn’t in large part luck that we got him. I’d argue the free cap spaces for gru, burakovsky amazing contract, and Bork over mentioning tolvanen and having cap space to renegotiate with Dunn this year and Beniers next year
Hi, welcome to America
So? Lol do you understand that the USA has cultural differences from the rest of the world? Are you gonna be upset to learn that Zimbabwe doesn't carry the NFL? Pro soccer is a niche sport

Tolvanen was partly luck but lack of cap space on other teams is part of the reason he fell to the Kraken.  Cap space gives you the ability to seize opportunities and Tolvanen was one of them.  I do agree with your other points, though.
Welcome to white, segregated america.  Champions league final and world Cup are bigger globally than any other US sporting final, and are catching them even within the US.
Fyi, more Americans watch soccer than hockey.

Nice work boys.
Damn….. That’s pretty cool!
The latest two Finnish 50+ goal scorers.  Hoping Rants manages 55.
Two Avs legends.
I choose to believe the wording of this tweet means Teemu is secretly Rants’ father.
the kid in the back got some insane drip
That’s great!!!!
Based Teemu
Wholesome
Nice, I hope he gets 100 pts this year.
Such a Selanne thing to say.
Love me some Teemu.
Avs record would be so great. Looks like he's all but locked in for 100pts on the year too which is amazing.
> The latest two Finnish 50+ goal scorers.  Hasn't there only ever been 3 of them total lol  E: Like 3 players, not 3 seasons
Teemu Selanne is Mikko Rantanen father
You mean Patrik Laine?
For this and absolutely nothing else he’s up to at the moment.
Not so much if you've looked at his twitter feed lately.
Yeah these two and Kurri
EK gonna get 100 for sure wild as hell to see
Excellent result - cheers you groovy fuckers
Gg's Sharks fans. Fun game threads this week. Y'all are good ones. Go 100 points for EK and Moose!
EK is apparently just not human this year.
That was fun, gg Sharks bros.
That Karlsson assist and play leading up to it was fucking nasty
Good clean game with almost no whistles. Georgiev is amazing.
Awesome game! Congrats Rants! Above and beyond. Can't wait to see this team can do in the playoffs.  Go get that 100 Karlsson! Only 2 more left!
Alright this game was much more like what I would have expected on Tuesday Night.   Tonight was the 2nd game in 3 Days playing in San Jose and this game was more or less what I expected out of both games, but at least we didn’t fuck around tonight. 1st Period and it was a relatively quiet for the majority of the period, but unfortunately the Sharks took the early lead. But luckily we tied the fucker up when Rants who missed out on getting Goal #50 on Tuesday didn’t fuck around tonight and scored his 50th Goal on the 20th Anniversary of Hejduk scoring 50 Goals. 2nd Period and we come out swinging with Rants wanted to make up for lost time in scoring non empty netters scored his 2nd Goal and he was fucking active tonight. Few minutes later Mack got on the board and after a hot mic incident caught on Altitude, Rants scored a Hatty and what a way to enjoy said night and inching closer to 100 Points himself. Sharks pull Kahkonen and inserted Reimer, and at first it worked as the Sharks cut the lead to 2. But Reimer didn’t know what hit him as Meyers who as a recent call up found a way to get pass Reimer and got on the board. 3rd Period and still putting our foot on the gas, Meyers found another one past Reimer and God sent Reimer his reguards. Went to lockdown mode and made sure we ended this game in a easy mode and unlike Tuesday we didn’t sweat it out and got the 2 points and still retain our position at #1 in the Central and get 4/4 in Northern California. Now we head down the 5/ (or if you want to take the leisure route along the California Coast on the 101)towards Southern California and play the Kings and Ducks for the Weekend and hopefully keep this up before heading back home to on Monday.
Moose hatty!
Now we just have to stay even with Dallas from here on out. We get 5 games, they get 4, we have the tiebreaker. Gonna be exciting!
You guys are one one of the teams i dont hate for Bedard, Chicago would bum out. Cheers!
Looked pretty human on those three goals against lol    I know he can do better, but regardless assists like that are worth it. Loved the net crash goal too
Nobody posted it on the sub? Saw a clip on instagram and my jaw dropped to the floor
I believe regulation wins is the tiebreaker, and Dallas holds that.
Sharks highlights almost never get posted unless its something happening against us lol
Kings vs Oilers featuring the Golden Knights the way that GDT was going lol
This game establishing the...  *checks GDT*  ... Edmonton Oilers as the bad guys? Not how I expected the night to go but a welcome turn of events.
Can’t understate how massive that win is.  Nearly guarantees us home ice for the first round, with us being 6 up on LA with three to play. Also keeps us up three on Edmonton.
GG LA Don't let Seattle catch ya 😘
What a crazy first period! Huge W
Little late to the party but I heard the game thread was pretty insane so I checked it out.   Did not disappoint. Very fun read lol
No Fiala, Vilardi and Anderson puts in a worst place than how we ended last season. Totally unwatchable.
Is it normal for fans in Vegas to chant “go kings”? I heard it at least 2 times tonight with all the arena it felt like doing it. Tons of LA jerseys.
Can't wait for the playoff GDT between these two
Just wait until you play them in the playoffs.
I thought there was no way, but then I looked at the standings lmao. LA really slipping
Lol imagine if LA loses out and gets smoked by Colorado in the WC.  That would be fucking gold.
Wrong team to be complaining about injuries to
No stone carrier or Theodore and don’t even get me started on goalies. Every team has injuries my guy
we havent had stone, theodore, carrier, thompson, and hill for these last stretch of games
This comment is so tone-deaf lol
What is the time table on their return? Will you guys have them back for our inevitable matchup?
What happened to them?
Not sure why this got downvoted. Vegas is a tourist destination and we’re practically a suburb of SoCal. Even though the Kings are one of our two closest neighbors, there are times when T-Mobile is filled with opposing jerseys, especially Western Canadian teams.
There are a lot of Kings fans in and around Vegas. Not to mention I’m sure many drive in from LA. Before the Knights came, kings jerseys/ stickers on cars were the most common to see around town.
I don't wanna. :(
We won’t have to. LA will beat them.   I’ve been Danault’d in a series before.
You know anyone can visit the threads and see that both Oilers fans and Kings fans are acting like weirdos, right?
Hopefully it won't happen because the last two games of our season are vs SEA but you never know
Or Seattle sneaks in to number 3 and smokes Edmonton 🙊
Edmonton vs Seattle would be a scoreathon from hell
SRT it's waaaaay past your bedtime, tell your care taker it's time to get tucked in.
Who needs Stone, Theodore or Thompson when you've got Dorofeyev, Hutton and the reanimated corpse of Jonathan Quick?
Yep, how many goalies have we even been through now. Captainless too and currently sitting on top of the west lol
Sounds like you guys have a HC that's capable of adjusting and not buckling under the slightest pressure. How's that feel?
Fiala should be ready to go. They aren't telling us shit about the other two.
During our pre-game show tonight, Stoll said that Fiala and Anderson will likely be back a couple games prior to the playoffs, but Vilardi and Edler are still unknown.
Fiala knocked knees with Cogs.  Anderson was boarded hard by McDavid.  Vivaldi I'm unsure on.
Sweep them bb
I mean it wouldn't be that horrible, we would get a series against Seattle instead of LA.
I think if Seattle catches LA then Edmonton probably catches you because you play twice and they’d need those points
Seattle catching LA could very well mean the oilers catch Vegas tbf and also they have too many former oilers for me
Hammer the over every single game 😂
[removed]
Hey, Dorofeyev has been electric since joining the team
Jesus, that comment about Quick gave me The Mountain/Robert Strong vibes (if you followed Game of Thrones anyway). Would have been something to put on his mask.
Not to mention no Carrier or Theo. We've got our main goalie tandem out, and 3 starters on top of that.
It also helps we have a bunch of depth all of a sudden after the trades at the deadline for Barby and Blueger, plus Dorofeyev coming up and killing it/forcing his was all the way up to the 1st line. We are scratching 2 pretty legitimate players a night despite the injuries
Vilardi fell hard into the boards and hit his head.
Oh I thought fiala had come back from that. Damn that sucks ass for them
How about you take care of the oilers, we take care of the Kraken/jets (whoever ends up there), and then we meet in the second round? Deal?
Would be fucking hilarious to play them 9 games in a row
[removed]
Even with major injuries the Knights are getting it done. And against all odds you guys are surprisingly deep. It's fun to watch.
True, but he is no stone or theo. Love scorofeyev though <3
He's missed 10 of 13 games since then.  Played a few but was clearly not 100%.  He'll play in playoffs though.
Deal. Playoffs are a different beast and I’m really hoping my Kongs can become Kings and do that.
Hopefully only 6 games in a row ya feel me?
[removed]
I'm genuinely surprised by some of the prospects we've had come up, considering all the picks we've traded away in the past.
Was really looking forward to the LAK-VGK rivalry after 2018 and was sad it got derailed by the Kings immediately falling off, hopefully with y’all good again it can start in earnest.
This guy knows how to playoffs.
[removed]
Who needs first round picks/prospects when the rest does the job?
Gal*  😜
Whoops! My bad! 😅
Big day for Judas
Slick pass
Fucking A! Ben Meyers was Godmode against Reimer tonight.
Lol why Judas?
Born in Minnesota, played for the University of Minnesota, signed with Colorado. I can see why some might see it as a betrayal hahaha
VGK should have 3 but I don't see Vegas listed. Detroit is listed with 3 and 4
According to NHL standing the Blue Jackets have a 1/1 record in shootout games so they have a shootout loss. They were also held to 0 goals scored by Marc-Andre Fleury and the Minnesota Wild on February 23rd, thus being part of (at least) one shutout.
470ish days since Vancouver's last shutout
Detroit have 4, Husso got his 4th of the season against Montreal
Damn right, the boys have a job to do 🫡
If they have 4, they have 3
Last shutout was Bruce’s debut with the team lol..... a 4-0 W over LA.
They are the only team listed twice. I was trying to help OP fix his chart.
it was a failed joke
That was the first Bruce game right?
Tocchet has this team playing good enough to not be in the race for Bedard.
It was me, finally dropped him in my fantasy league pre-game….ugh
Now tied with the Capitals for the 8th worst record... and Vancouver has games vs the Ducks and the Coyotes.  So, it looks like the 9th worst record after all is said and done.
Yes
There it was.
There it is.
Thank u rick 🥲
Thats not right. Lol
Oh man, it's everywhere.
I wish I had as much faith in this team beating the Ducks as you do.
It’s not
Rather have one Bure.
Does Horvat still count as a Canucks 30 goal scorer?
Iinm there are only 3 teams with 4 guys in the top 50 in NHL points... Edmonton, Toronto and Vancouver..
I'm sure the fans are ecstatic
I mean he scored 30 this year as a canuck
😂 it’s an arbitrary stat so it can count or not count however you want  4 players to score 30 goals for the Canucks this year? yes  4 Canucks who currently have at least 30 goals? no  but for any sense of authority on the matter….  NHL tracks a lot of trivia milestones and there’s a record for where they track which teams have the most players to reach 30, 50, etc goals  > https://records.nhl.com/records/team-records/milestone-goals-and-points/most-30-plus-goals-one-season  Horvat is still listed as a Canuck for 30 goals this season  (sort by season to find the 22-23 VAN quickly)
It's in the NHL's [record book](https://records.nhl.com/van/records/skater-records/goals/skater-most-goals-one-season), so I'm saying yes.
IMO he does since he scored the goals as a Canuck.
He had 30 just in his time with Vancouver so I'd say yes
He does not
Surely that means all of them should be Stanley cup contenders... right?
Sing with me everyone.... One of these things is not like the others
the NHL still counts him as per the official record website
Hirose with 2 assists. Nice!
I'm happy about the shutout. But this stat just makes the whole season even more depressing  [Thanks to J.T. Miller's 3-0 goal, Canucks have four 30-goal scorers in the same season for the first time since 1992-93](https://twitter.com/SNstats/status/1644195221792518146?t=ljxTeeMru1bclotNblc35Q&s=19)
Funny how we both used to be competing for Cup runs and now we both should be tanking for Bedard
He's exceeded my expectations.  If he keeps this up through the end if the season, I would like to see him on the second pair with Hronek next year.
Offense :)  Defense :(
That’s pretty remarkable.  OTOH you have at least one redeeming feature this season.  The same cannot be said for the Hawks.
the playmakers nowadays are the best guys on their team (mcdavid, kucherov, mackinnon), so they’re just called that instead.
Because the best playmakers are scoring 50 goals
Has anyone ever heard this term used this way before?
I remember when that term was used too. I think it fell out of favor because "playmaker" describes a player as opposed to an event like Hat Trick does. Maybe if a different term was used it would have stuck. Something like a player had an Apple Pie or something someone more creative than me can come up with.  Edit: corrected "to" to "too".
I've never heard this term in 40+ years in reference to 3 assists in one game.  In general some players are playmakers yes  Best are Kucherov Marner McDavid and Mackinnon
See: Mitch Marner
drai is a playmaker
Matias Maccelli will have a word
We have David Krejci but he’s also the “master of time and space”.
The Oilers play-by-play man uses this when it happens quite often!
MIKKO!
Nope
Forgot about Drai.  MFers always be forgetting about Drai.
I don’t even think he has 50 assists. Best passer in the nhl as votes by the players is Drai, and he has 50+ goals  Play makers in the nhl are marner, Drai, mcdavid, kuch, Crosby… few others I’m forgetting I’m sure
Nope didn't forget about him.
Title does not do this justice
What the actual fuck
An utterly absurd pass that was finished off with an equally impressive snipe from Hayton
Calculated. Calculated. Calculated.
Ppl really sleepin on Maccelli with the Calder race
 This was an accident right? Right?? I can’t tell but if it was an accident  that’s still an amazing play if he wiffed to automatically spin and fire the backhand pass right on target. That’s incredible whether or not he planned it or if it was spontaneous
One of the best passes I've ever seen in person
WHAT THE FUCK. THE TITLE JUST SAID THIS IS AN ASSIST BUT MY GOD WAS I SHOOKEDT.
Task failed successfully.
Holy fuck, that was just a fucking filthy assist there.
Nifty
That’s nasty, and the finish equally so.
Just watched this 20+ times
The true Calder Winner
Ugh
As a rookie, Maccelli is already one of the most elite passers in the NHL
Serious question, was that whole pass intentionall?
We call this move bulgarialainen in Finland
This is some Zegras level stuff
nice recovery on the pass but that’s an even nastier snipe
Is Arizona goin to be relevant lets say in 5 years if they can keep Maccelli, Hayton, Välimäki and few other guys?
What a fake to throw everyone off before the pass.
Nice save bro
Was at the game and turned to my seat neighbor and said "Now Matty's got to score" He did.  It was a great game inside the game between 2 Calder front runners.
u/savevideo
IN
Fuck off…that was beautiful!
Do you think he meant to fake or was it a whiff?
Sweet recovery on that
This is insane, embarrassed I’ve never heard of this guy before lol
It’s a nice shot but the pass is far better be reasonable
Chat disabled...
He was injured for a good bit but otherwise he should be top candidate
They're really not, he's the third favorite in terms of betting odds
Ya 36 assists is a lot more than I would've expected him to have, that's a great total for a rookie
He almost certainly whiffed, but Maccelli has been tossing pin point passes all year in pretty much every way imaginable. I’m not shocked he recovered well enough to deliver it on the tape anyways
Definitely was an accident but that shouldn’t take away from the fact that he recovered masterfully and still made the play. Good quick thinking to still get the pass off.
Definitely whiffed at first but recovery was on purpose and intentional
I’m choosing to believe it was all done on purpose. It’s just too damn smooth
Defense can’t predict where your going if you also don’t know where your going. 5d chess
Even if he missed the first pass, second was even more impressive
I’m like seriously pissed if he is not nominated. Dude has played quite alot of less games that Berniers and others and are 2nd in points and not even that much behind berniers.
Based
Doesn’t look like it
Desperation pass after a fan attempt and a coverage & screening mistake by 24.   But no yeah godly pass lol /s
You forgot Bedard, but yes
We're hoping it doesn't take that long. There's a reasonably good chance Cooley and Guenther are in the NHL next year and they should be a huge boost to our offense. Välimäki and Hayton are signed through next year. We need to lock up Maccelli and McBain, sort out our goaltending situation (Ingram could steal the starter job next season), and we're looking at a pretty good line up. I expect to see us go pretty D heavy in the draft; it's our main hole right now.

He plays for the yotes lol  Hayton scored the golden goal in his wjc year and has been pounding the NHL all year too and we don't see him either.  The yotes are full of talent
Only reason I knew the name was because I relocated Arizona in NHL 23 franchise mode
Yap and still is 2nd in points and not that far away from bernier even tho having mauch less games
What I meant was Beniers seems to be the consensus pick for winner but imo it is very close
3 weeks ago he was 12th best odds @ +10000
Absolutely incredible how fast he did all of that after whiffing on the shot
I agree with you. I think he faked the shot to get the pass off
I think it still goes to Beniers in the end but he absolutely should be nominated.
Haha yeah, but i want to see Bedard on Columbus or Chicago 👀
The Yotes have a really good top 6 and goalie, and otherwise they're lacking.
He scored the tying goal, not the golden. But his was insanely impressive, was injured and could barely raise his arm pre game
I think Beniers has run away with it.  Beniers has played more games has .01 less PPG but has scored way more goals, he's a much bigger defensive contributor and is usually the 1C on a team that's qualified for the playoffs for the first time in franchise history.  If we go purely by production Beniers is still the pick, and when you open up the criteria he is clearly the overwhelming favorite as a top 2 center on a good team.
Yeah because he didn’t really follow through. Idk i could be wrong
The only argument for Maccelli over Beniers is that Maccelli has a higher ppg (and would be closer to Beniers in points if not for injury) and he plays for a much shittier team than Seattle lol but Im biased. They both better get the nods
Columbus would be cool, Chicago… 🤢
Valamaki and Moser is a really good D pairing
I do like Moser on D but yeah they need more
the fact the Maccelli has a better PPG on a much worse team is more impressive imo.... plus im a homer.
No love for Stuart Skinner ☹️
Valimaki and Moser are pretty solid but I think on a good team they're the 2D and 3D that play on the monster second pair. I think the Yotes are... not a good team, but one where there's more potential than people realize. If you were trying to build a contender, there's worse options than starting with the Yotes between already existing good players (Keller, Schmaltz, Macelli, Hayton, Crouse; Valimaki, Moser; Vejmelka) and the solid prospect pool they've accumulated (Guenther/Cooley/Geekie is a great add-on to the existing forward group, defense is suspect but I think Soderstrom can still be a solid 4D). They're definitely getting hammered by the optics over reality angle.
You could argue that either way, I think propelling a team to a first ever playoff birth as a teenager has made beniers a lock
none, its next to impossible to get nominated as a goalie without a historic season, hes 24, and Thompsons numbers are better anyways
Not to mention Stu was a 3rd round pick while LT was a UDFA.
Genuinely curious, has someone's draft position ever affected their chances at the Calder trophy positively or negatively?
Don’t think so, but at least from a media perspective the underdog narrative generates hype.  LT had a mediocre juniors career and went to Canadian college hockey, yet somehow has turned into a genuinely good NHL starter.
We’re talking about an award giving by media members, both hype coming into the rookie season and an underdog story could work in favour of a candidate.
...yaaay  Love breakin' records.
Very interested in this off season for chevy
For the first time in Las Vegas Golden Knights history
Welcome to Bowness hockey.
Teams been broken since after Christmas 2019. Just keep getting worse and worse. Imo, I've been saying it for a few years. Blow it up. To run it again, expecting different is the definition of insane. The winnipeg jets sub reddit is funny. it's half that see its over, the other half are delusional thinking there is something there. All I see is a team full of players that either want out or don't give a crap. Goes to show that when about a quarter of player you get. Be that from draft or trades, If they don't want to stay you can't win.
Nooo, I wanna see Calgary miss the playoffs.
Thaaaats a shame
We still probably will. If Nashville beats Winnipeg then Nashville leapfrogs both jets and flames for the final wildcard spot. Flames have to win out basically. And that would require them setting a season best 4 game win streak…
So your saying there’s a chance
So the current, non-IIHF points Bruins would still be 3rd in their division lol
After seeing Team Canada accomplish the near-impossible at the 2021 Men's World Championship, anything is possible!

Two points away from 100pts on the season too.  The Moose is the Loosest
Give him the Hart I will ignorantly be accepting no counter arguments that start with Mc at this moment in time
So two more points from Rantanen and two more points from Karlsson and we could have two guys hit 100 points in the same game!
He's good
Somebody should give that Mikko guy an NHL contract.
The loose moose went and got a little looser.  Turns out he decided to be the loosest of moosets.    ... pretty sure that is proper English.
60 goal season...
He good
SJ was getting called out for not tanking hard enough. But pause the video at the 1s mark, and that's clearly a Tank Commander defensive play.
So fucking awesome to have a guy like Rants and he’s be that one consistent from earlier in the season when things looked bleak. He said don’t worry I got this.   Also loved how unlike on Tuesday Night, we were playing stressfree Hockey not having to worry about Mack getting 100 Points or Rants getting 50 Goals.
Damn Nate was really feeding him tonight
Terrible defense just leaving him on the back door and covering no one else
Fucking campers lol
These cats out here acting like they're McJesus and the Kraut.
Does any other single player do that choke-down move on tap-ins?
~~Wish he would make me the loosest~~ 🤤  A most skillful display 🧐
Everyone knows McDavid is a product of the Nuge anyway
He won't win, sadly, but should definitely be #2.  No way the Avs even make the playoffs without him
Sure, he won’t win the hart. But I want to see him get at least a few 2nd place votes.
Idk man Mikko Koivu’s kinda been done already
It was as if they got a talking to after rallying to put the last game into OT and almost winning.  They did not make the same mistake tonight.
Ranty with the hanty
You mean the guys who swept them out of the playoffs last year?
It’s like choking up on a bat. Easier to control. I mean when he’s that wide open on the back of the net he can take a bit of time to make sure he finished.
Connor McDavid is nothing without Evander Kane
Sorry im drunk tonight and being a smartass. Will be a fun round 1 matchup even tho we’ll lose
No no, he wasn’t talking about that Mikko. What he said still doesn’t make any sense, though, as Mikko Koskinen is playing in Europe now
Yeah I understand the theory, but my question is, does literally any other player do this ever? I can't think of anyone
What about mikko eloranta?
Rantanen also has 4 points on the night and sits at 52 goals 98 points   Filthy evening
These numbers are all off. Mack has 73 EVP, Mcdavid has 72
EK65 somehow at 71 in 77 games with the sharks
MacKinnon is at .92 P/PG at 5v5, which is fucking nuts.
I believe Mikko also has  the most even strength goals in the league
Just goes to show how insane Mcdavid is ~~on the PP~~
So the post is simultaneously false and correct at the same time?
Hmmm, I was getting stats from here https://www.statmuse.com/nhl/ask?q=nhl+even+strength+points+leaders+2022-2023+season
73 in 78 after tonight, tied with Mack for the league lead. And most EVP by a defenseman in a season not named Orr or Coffey. EK65 is amazing to watch!
Lol yeah. Mack is actually the overall even points leader now, not just points per game.
Statmuse is way off sometimes, not faulting you though, your title is still correct lol.
Yeah, I find Statsmuse is consistently off when it comes to anything regarding whether points are even strength, powerplay, or shorthanded.
Talking about even strength points is cherry picking?
You are right, NaturalStatTrick has different stats. Mackinnon is actually way ahead in even strength points per game
A cherry picked stat would be like, who scores the most on the road on Tuesdays.. who scores the most at even strength actually means something. Quit being so soft, everyone still knows hockeybot is the overlord of everything.
For what it's worth... Tuesday road game statlines are:   Mackinnon: 3g-2a-5pts in 4 GP  McDavid: 3g-9a-12pts in 6 GP    McDavid clearly the superior player on Tuesdays on the road lol   Edit: But Tage Thompson is a monster away on Tuesdays. 7-7-14 in 8
Hahah I love Reddit.
great job by Toews to block the skates
Yellow card has been issued to Chicago #24, free kick has been awarded to Canucks
Boy got hops
That’s actually really nice of him twinge not to skate on whoever fell there
I mean to me.. this seems like a heroic leap. Unlikely it would of happened but imagine he just lost his footing and fell skate first on that unprotected part of his leg there?
Rare footage of Toews protecting his teammates
For that? Game's gone smh.
VAR Red card penalty kick
Such a crazy decision to pass that. Genius.
Slick hands from Erod there god damn
Damn that was silky by Erod
I can't remember seeing a pass quite like that before, bold, smooth, and completely unexpected.
ERod was still in 'just-pass-it-to-Rants-so-he-can-get-50' mode. Short memory!
So many loose mooses today, as should be! 🔥
fish out of water lol 😂
Kahkonen bit hard lol
Mikko is a product of Erod
I love Evan Rodrigues and his fit on this line. I've never seen a player with his combination of creativity and patience and the ECHL shot to go with it.
Fucking A! Rants finishing off a nice soft filthy pass from ERod there.
Erod definitely showed everyone why he fits this team so well. He plays hard at both ends of the ice (including a pesky forechecking presence) and has no selfishness on his game.
Einstein ain't got shit on Erod
Aaand, 51.
Third finnish player to reach 50 goals in a season! Only Teemu Selänne and Jari Kurri have achieved this before.
20 years to the day
and the fastest to do it in avalanche history
Fucking A! Not only Rants wanted to score his 50th, he wanted to get a Hatty tonight.
It is weird to me that clubs retain history after a relocation.
And now 52
All Avalanche greats.
I think you mean Tiimu Salami and Jari Curry.
This is why everytime I move to a new city I change all my personal information.
Why?  It's the teams history not the history of the city.
Keep 'em coming.
As are all great players in spirit.
Avalanche legends
I think you meant Harry Caray. Holy cow!
Like I said, just weird to me personally, but I actually do associate the history with each city and not the club as the fans change every time a club moves.
Amazing move by the GM who looked at all the underlying stats and knew it was just a matter of time before he popped off so the inked him for 8mil before he was worth 10.
But did he play against men?????
My king
What a deal. That’s basically what we gave Johansen and Duchene…
So prospects have been noticably more hyped the few years, starting since the Matthews draft.  When tanking is normalized in sports you end up having people think it should be rewarded. So when guys like Hughes take a couple years to become superstars somehow that isn't normal anymore.  McDavid, Eichel, Matthews, and Laine aren't the normal for prospects, but people have been noticably harder on young players since because of how good they looked.  2017-  Took Hischier 5 years to hit 60 points  Nolan Patrick has had his career derailed due to injury  Miro Heiskanen career high in points was 36 until this year.  2018-  Dahlin really was a top defenseman entering the league, but people still didn't think it was good enough.  Svechnikov had 37 points his rookie season  Kotkaniemi hasn't been over .5 PPG until this year.  2019-  Hughes had 21 and 31 points his first two years.  Kakko hasn't been above .5 PPG until this year.  Dach had a career high of 26 points until this year.  2020-  Laf has 21 and 31 points his first two years, and is above .5 PPG this season.  Byfield has spent time in the AHL this season  Stutzle had 29 points his first season.
As a Rangers fan Hughes scares me for our likely upcoming playoff series. Honestly I think he’s got a good chance of eventually beating McDavid for the Art Ross. Maybe within 2-3 years time. He’s just so shifty and slick with the puck
Quick somebody link the thread of him signing his contract and everyone saying it was a huge risk and he was overpaid
Amazing what a couple years of growing and professional training will do.
Remember a few years back when Marner was not extended early and opted to playout their ELCs and sign contracts upon expiry with the Marner deal being especially contentious? There was a rumour going about that the previous summer, Marner's agent had a hard take it or leave it deal offered to the Leafs. Marner the prior year had put up 69 points in 82 games and was reportedly asking for $8-8.5 million per year for an extension. The reasoning was that he collected the majority of his points in the second half of the season and that was gonna be a more accurate indicator of who he was gonna become going forward. I think he was scoring at a 90 point pace from December 2018 onwards. The Leafs balked and then Marner put up 94 points in the 18-19 season and the $8-8.5 million deal was taken off the table. That was also the same off season if you remember, that Rantanen and Point expired and had contentious negotiations (not as bad as Marner though).   Since then:  Clayton Keller, signed a $7.1x8 contract after a 47 point season. Overpaid at the time, contract looks like a bargain now  Thomas Chabot, signed an $8x8 contract. Given what he does as a two way guy, great deal now, overpaid at the time.  Nick Suzuki - $7.8x8 still overpaid  but the assumption is that he'll grow into it.  Jack Hughes as the title suggests.  The lesson we should all be taking from the Marner contract is that you extend your young studs early and overpay now rather than overpaying later or even paying a fair deal later. Marner is I think fairly paid now but had the Leafs "overpaid" him when he was asking for $8.8x8 they're a lot better off. I can't think of an instance where a team let a guy play out his entire ELC before initiating contract talks and having it turn out well for them. There's usually a hold out of some sort or they end up paying way more than they would have to.   I would even say someone like Jesperi Kotkaniemi is likely going to pay off in a year or two. He signed an $4.8x8 deal coming off a 29 points in 66 campign and just hit a career high this season and looks like he's on an upward trajectory now.
Well everyone knows triples is best.
Wait hold on, they got him for an 8x8? Oh jeez, this is going to be a steal in 3 years for the Devils
Use me as the "I sounded like an absolute idiot in the signing thread and was so insanely wrong" button.
Took awhile but it's rad seeing him become the player we thought he'd be.
Contract has nothing to do with it. Surround a star player with good plays, and let the kid grow. That's what made the difference.
He Mackinnoned himself.
Jack "not Albert Haynesworth" Hughes
Also known as the Draisaitl or MacKinnon.
I remember ppl bitching that his contract value was too high after 55 pts in 120 games.  looks like the GM is a genius now!
What did Doughty think of the contract???
I would argue that he did a pretty shit job at highballing what Hughes could have signed for. I wasn’t in the room but Hughes numbers he was putting up and regardless of his potential to me seems like they could have signed him for less
Hard to say yet, he looks like a boy
Hischier also hit 50 points in his first season, had some bad injury luck in seasons 3 and 4
> So prospects have been noticably more hyped the few years, starting since the Matthews draft.  I don't agree that prospects are more hyped in recent, but I do agree with your statement that the expectations for an early payoff from a top prospect have changed.  It's possible to take that too literally, of course.  I remember when Jason Spezza was taken 2nd overall by Ottawa, who had just had a 109-point season...when he was sent back to the OHL out of his first camp at age 18, there were intelligent hockey people who were wondering if Spezza was destined to be a bust.  At the same time, the expectation in years past with top picks was mostly that they'd go back to junior for another year and then work their way in.  But I think part of that is a fundamental change in two things: the way the game is played now compared to then, and the way that skill development/conditioning/nutrition has changed drastically since then.  25 years ago, a top prospect was unlikely to be in anything resembling real physical condition, and they'd be entering a league in which guys like Chris Therien and Mike Rathje were getting a ton of ice time.
Just to add context to Byfield, the only reason he spent time in the AHL this year is because he had a bad illness and needed a few weeks for conditioning after losing a bunch of weight
I will point out that Stützle had 29 points in 53 games that first season. We were all quite pleased with how he did in that weird covid season.
The only guys that move like Hughes on the puck for me are McDavid and Mackinnon. Like you can just tell those guys are different with how fast and shifty they are.
I feel like he has that X factor but to get to that level he’d definitely need to round out the loose ends of his game like faceoffs or board battles
> Honestly I think he’s got a good chance of eventually beating McDavid for the Art Ross. Maybe within 2-3 years time.  The gap between <McDavid>'s production and <_anyone's_> production is enormous. I'm very doubtful.  Hughes has 95 points this year. McDavid has 86 _assists_ this year and 96 points in his past 52 games.  Hughes has 8 games with 3+ points. McDavid has 10 games with 4+ points.  Hughes has been held off the scoresheet 20 times. McDavid 7 times.  This will be the 7th year in a row that McDavid finishes 1st or 2nd in points. Hughes has an outside chance at finishing top-10 for the first time.
He's the closest thing to a one man show other than McDavid. Definitely terrified.
I watched Hughes the last time we played him and sweet baby jesus he has developed a lot in a year, you can feel his presence on the ice, reminds me of Nathan MacKinnon. Waiting for Kakko and Laf to bloom.

Took awhile? Dudes 21.
did it really take that long? he had 56 points in 49 games as a 20 year old..
Yeah. It gets frustrating seeing a team turning on a player who's only a few seasons in. There's a huge skill gap and learning curve between college level and NHL level play
Nor did I imply the contract did anything. Im praising the timely manner of it by the GM. Signing him **before** he goes nuclear, thus capturing him at a better value
Youngsters! it was the Backstrom, Giroux, and later the Tavares first haha
Had to look at draisaitls contract. 8.5 for 2 more years is just ridiculous
Been hanging out with Lou lately eh?
Oh you weren’t in the room? Thanks for clarifying Nostradamus.
Could say the same for Bo Horvat, who signed for more and is much older for the same term.
In your opinion, what would have been a good cap hit for Hughes?
Not in that second thread. Once you get out of that top 10 comments, you start getting a lot of awful takes  > Everyone liking this deal now said the same thing about the Hischier contract and that has not worked out well for NJ so far.   > Massive over pay, that’s more millions than points he’s scored in his career. This will be a funny thread to look back on in a few years   > This thread is going to be hilarious to look back on in a few years. I think this is a drastic overpayment personally but meh we’ll see. That Hischier contract still isn’t out of the woods in terms of being an albatross either at this point in time.  > That's insane he's done nothing. Have fun with that one New Jersey. He's one hit away from being fully broken.
As in 4th year in the league
He’s gonna take us to the cleaners in 2025 but justifiably so.  Praying him and Connor sit down and agree to shave a mill or two each to keep making beautiful music together.
And the geniuses in this Reddit said it was a bad signing
Oh fuck off, seriously would u consider a guy with 55 points in 120 games worth a long term contract of 8x8? Hell no and your ducking crazy to even think they are if you do. Just because the contract worked out doesn’t make it good asset management. I’m sure they could have gotten a lower average per year.
Nostra-dumbass\*
No shit. Enough of that whataboutism. People get butt hurt when I call out that giving a guy who ha 55 points in 120 games a 8x8 regardless of draft spot is poor asset management. Watching Hughes no one expected him to become what he is now. Bullshit if you did. Just because it panned out to be a steal doesn’t make the initial signing at the time good. It became good.
Like mentor, like mentee. Shero gave Hischier that albatross of a contract, now Fitz has given Hughes that terrible contract. Two first overalls, two massive busts, can't believe we didn't take Patrick and Kakko. As Steve Dangle said last off season (and yes, he genuinely said this), it's time for the Devils to break it down and try again - assuming they can find someone to take these terrible contracts.
this one is my favorite   https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/r5yg3u/comment/hmpv58r/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3
Nico catching strays in that thread is also hilarious
If you have to go over 10 comments down to find negative comments, it just means they weren’t widely held beliefs.
I said "most", not "all".
he did that in his third year. he had a slow rookie year when he clearly wasn’t big enough for the league, then a covid season, then point-per-game player.   just weird to call that “a while”. lafreniere is taking a while. jack figured it out pretty damn quickly.
Points aren't the only thing GMs use to evaluate talent
For his age at the time and considering his skating and iq was not really in doubt, and with NJs salary cap at the time? Yeah it certainly didn't bother me at the time.   Especially considering around that time Fitz was talking about how this franchise will take the next step when Nico and Jack do, and if it wasn't going to work out with them we were heading to rebuild 3.0 anyway
Hughes wouldn't have signed an 8 year contract if they didn't offer 8. They certainly could have signed him for 5m or so but for only a 2 year contract probably. Jack Hughes and his agent aren't stupid...
I dunno man, I’m pretty sure a whole bunch of us knew Jack was going to be a superstar. Just because *you* didn’t doesn’t mean shit.  You don’t generally draft someone 1OA thinking they might not pan out.
> Watching Hughes no one expected him to become what he is now. Bullshit if you did.  This is /u/BladeParadigmHF levels of uninformed lol. I can only assume you neither watched Hughes nor do you know any Devils fans.  Like look at the comments on here: https://www.reddit.com/r/devils/comments/r5yfp9/devils_sign_jack_hughes_to_8year_64m_contract/  And hell, even this sub mostly thought it was a good call: https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/r5yg3u/mesisak_im_hearing_it_is_eight_years_64_million/
You could see glimpses of it year one when he was routinely getting ragdolled. You saw a very clear vision of it year 2. I'd say it was more uncommon to find a Devils fan who didn't believe Jack would be able to do this by start of year 3 than to find believers. Watching the way he progressed from year 1 to 2 and how dynamic he was it was a matter of time until he figured it out. That time was not going to be very long.
Lol I like Steve but I completely forgot he said that last year. What a ridiculous take.
I think he is just meaning not instantly like McDavid and Matthews. No need to be insulted lol
I think it’s clear that what they mean is that he didn’t immediately establish himself as the best of his class and as one of the best in the league. Feels like it’s being taken as more of an insult by way of nitpicking whatever “a while” means or something when they were obviously giving him a compliment. Guy’s a superstar stud and has erased any hint of a question mark on that, but it’s still fair to say there was a period were the question mark hung around, the person above was basically congratulating him on smashing that question mark into the dust.
I'm offended!
We’re New Jersey. *Everything* is a slight against us.
*NJ Devils vs everyone intensifies*
Seas, you say? arr.
If you want to do it legally, then [ESPN Player](https://www.espnplayer.com/packages) is the way to go. If not, the seas be full of streams.
You should tweet at statboy Steven - he’s got all the secrets
The VPN route is worth it! Watched from Belize on my honeymoon last year and had no issues at all. Going to Grand Cayman at the end of the month and so going that route again this year.
Yarr, matey! The high seas are good this time of year.
Ahoy matey!
McDavid should give him a call and tell him it's par for the course
Fastest in Avalanche history in 77 games(Sakic 79, Sakic 80, Hejduk 82) and third Finnish player in history besides Selänne and Kurri. :o
Fastest to 50 in Avalanche history.  *and 51. and 52.
Love Sammy getting over there to grab that puck.
He might honestly be the best player named Rantanen in the league right now.
THE LOOSEST MOOSE
The moose has been loose 50 times this season. Crazy
man, mackinnon is a sight to see. controls the whole ice when he’s out there
Very interested to see how many Hart votes he gets. He's been a rock for a team going through so many injuries. Obviously McDavid wins it, but I expect Tkachuk at #2 and probably an Avalanche forward or Robertson at #3
And I was like. . . . Miikkkkoooo!
Finns gonna wake up to a good Friday.
https://youtu.be/_1D1l7mdgU8
The Moose is loose! LFG Mikko!
He’s not going to win the Hart but he deserves his votes for a honourable nod.
Way to go moose! Let’s get another cup!
They look so at ease with this. Like they do this all the time.
A Møøse once bit my sister... No realli!
Great to see him hit 50. The scoring of the league is incredible this season.
What a guy
Hatty
Rantanen for Hart.
Finally!  Last time a Finn scored 50 goals was over 20 years ago.  Now just get that 100p, Mikko!
Wonder if they could find a way to make that ad even larger.
u/savevideo
What a fucking goal to make it #50 for Rants. Also on the same day that Hejduk scored his 50th Goal 20 years ago on the dot.
Fun fact, all three 50-goal Finns played for the Avs at some point
Two more points and he will join Kurri and Selanne as the only Finns with 100 points.
My favorite thing about records are the teammates being aware.  When MacK scored the OT goal last game for his 100th point, you can see Toews immediately chasing the puck to grab it.
Big if true tbh
Yeah he made that whole thing happen for Mikko
Everything he does is violent and terrifying
Is there anyone he can't beat consistently?
He’s one of the few, few players these days whose gravity seems to almost warp the ice when he’s on.
He probably won't end up as high as he should because Mack has also been incredible.  But I'm a pretty firm believer in him belonging in 2nd.    Rantanen leads the league in 5v5 goals and carried a super injured team all year long.
haha literally the first thing i checked after waking up is if he got 50
Hells yeah! My five year old daughter sings this every time he’s mentioned.
I recorded my kids singing this for every goal to start the season. I stopped after about 20 goals, I wish I had all 52 recorded to stitch together.

Ew gross
Hopefully he can get there in 5 games
When Mack realized this shot went in he seemed even more excited than usual, too. It’d only a second and then he’s out of frame, but you can just tell.
Remembering Duchene goal that no I’m have a fuck about lmao but him
Mikko is clearly a product of Mackinnon
?
Considering how MacK basically went on a crusade last night of feeding Mikko, there’s definitely a chance…
They're all products of Jack Johnson.
Ehh, a little but Mikko put the team on his back when Mack was out
The thought of Kurri and Selanne in Avalanche jerseys feels wrong  Like Gretzky in st Louis
It's Jack Johnson's world, we just live in it.
Nah, Mikko was definitely a product of Mackinnon's injury during that stretch
Hmmm. I guess I just remember Kurri winning the cup with Sakic, Roy, and Forsberg and if I forget I can look at his signature on an Avs sweater I have from back then with all of their signatures. A hall of famer playing on your team isn't 'gross' to me.
i for one welcome our new banana pancake overlord
MacKinnon’s stretching was definitely a product of Mikko’s injury
Kurri played for the Avs in 97-98, didn't win a cup here
Shhh.. I was like 10 years old and I got all the signatures in 97-98. I've created my own history.
I bet that's a sick sweater! You got the whole team from then?
Pretty much. I've been meaning to posts some pics to /r/Coloradoavalanche  I'll let you know when I do. I need a few identified.
#juststalockthings
They were handing out misconducts to anyone and everyone in an attempt to control the game, so that number is a little inflated. Sure, it was really chippy, but it wasn't quite as much of a Gong Show as that number suggests. The officials did a terrible job keeping that one under control - Jake Brenk in particular was one call behind all game...
I wonder how many times brothers playing against each other have both been kicked out of a game.
Was that the game where Ryan Miller jumped in to defend a rookie Troy Stecher from Matt Martin?
I remember that game. A rookie fucked around with Matt Martin and found out. Then all hell broke loose.
Yep. And the one where Rielly ran over Hansen. And the one where Kadri took a run at a shooting Sedin immediately after the Rielly hit.
I wasn’t watching hockey when that game happened, no clue those two events happened during the same game.   Hansen got clobbered by that hit from Reilly and then IMMEDIATELY fought Kadri 10 seconds later defending that hit on Sedin. Always gonna love Jannik Hansen for that play, dude was a warrior for us.   [clip](https://youtu.be/2HE0toBgcp4)
That was the best hit of Rielly's career.
For for real wtf. I've never seen anything like this from Rielly.
Username checks out
Portillo sold so hard lmao
at least RBA doesn’t have 2 things to be mad about tonight :)
Quinnipiac has a chance to win their first National Championship. They lost in the Final in 2013 and 2016.
The championship is now a win win. Either the Gophers win or the Big 10 loses.
Portillo choked tonight.
As a Quinnipiac alum and Devils fan: great stuff, just great stuff.   Just hope we don’t get Puke Hughes all the time.
The talk about Portillo is what it is, I just want to give a shout out to Sam Lipkin. Played his heart out and had a really solid game from what I saw. Yotes may have found a gem at 223OA
Another year, another Frozen Four loss. It's really depressing seeing Michigan teams in like every sport make their respective final four in the last year and come short (football 2021, 2022; men's basketball 2018; hockey 2018, 2022, 2023; baseball 2019)
Wooooooooo
Love the color scheme of those jerseys.
ROLL BOBCATS
Portillo let in two soft ones, oh well.  Gimme that Luke Hughes! Maybe at home vs Buffalo next week?
down goes Michigan, you love to see it
Brindamor Jr didn’t look too bad out there.   Wonder how he will fare if he signs with the oilers this off season or not.
That Quinnipiac team is like 100% anonymous to me. Who are their best players? Any future NHL’ers?
Whoever Michigan's goalie is absolutely sold, what a terrible performance
People will talk about Portillo but Luke Hughes had a terrible game
There were times Portillo looked like the guy who subs for your real goalie and has never played in the net.
Still the highest save % of any LA King tonight
I genuinely think he was playing hurt. He came up hobbled on a save in the third.  But their backup has played 5 games in 2 years so they didn't want to risk the unknown.
(RBA = Rod Brind'Amour  His son plays for Q)
I remember that crushing loss in 2013. Was in Afghanistan and so hyped. Our XO was a Yale guy and gave me shit for it the rest of the deployment.
Rooting for em.   That game against Michigan was fun.
He had some insane saves just wasnt moving after making initial saves so he got caught on two banks and had a wild snipe out of nowhere go in
My bro and his wife are both QU grads. They're giddy as well.
Is it though?
3 soft ones lol. 2 from behind the net bank shots and one wrister from the boards
Three soft ones?
Go green!
Definitely think he going to Bako next season, we have lots of college grads this offseason which is gonna help us massively
Perets has some really solid [numbers](https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/376468/yaniv-perets), but goalies are fucky so who knows how he'd do in the NHL. Three of their players have been drafted (Brind'Amour, Lipkin, and Clark).
Collin Graf was a Hobey finalist but missed the hat trick, he's their top scorer and probably best player. Goalie Yaniv Perets is solid (though his numbers are a bit weird bc Q doesn't give up a ton of shots, they possess the puck real well). Sam Lipkin was on the US WJC team. Zach Metsa is their best defender, Jacob Quillan was their best player on the night.
Think he was sick or something, announcers mentioned he was throwing up in a bin.
he was playing sick lmfao   dude was literally throwing up between shifts   people talk out of there ass a lot here lmao
Wjc type performance  Edit: we gonna act like Hughes wasn’t garbage in the wjc?
Honestly, he just sucks. Good teams exploit him at D1, he will never play in the NHL.  &#x200B;  It was the exact same story last year when the games mattered too. He is shaky, bad rebound control, constantly puts himself way out of position and seems to completely lose focus at points. The third or fourth goal tonight he looked like he simply was not paying attention.
Which Buccigross was happy to remind you of every five seconds even though he's like, the fifth best player on the team at best
I was working at Yale that year, every damn IT nerd at Yale ITS became a hockey fan overnight
Lmao didn’t they pull the goalie with like 10 minutes left or something like that. Crazy. I go to Q so I’m pumped I hope they bring it home this year. Tired of watching them choke. I got 4 of them in one of my classes. Quilly is one. Guys a stud.
Controller disconnected kind of thing. Didn't need much movement to take away both of those shots.
No, it is not. Not at all.  Message board champs.
Go white?
I'm curious to see if the Oilers take another guy with UVM ties this year, lol.   (The connection is fairly obvious - UVM's HC and the Oilers HC are brothers)
Still had a nice setup on Fantilli's goal
If he’s that sick he shouldn’t be playing
You can play sick and have a bad game. Dumbass.
He has what I like to call Matt O'Connor syndrome. He's an okay college goalie that got way too much hype because he played for a loaded team.  > Good teams exploit him at D1  Yup. Avash Kalra's postgame piece for CHN on Quinnipiac's gameplan indicated that their plan was to make him scramble and play deeper in his net
The bank shot from behind where he wasn't even on the post was inexcusable. Letting one in high glove, short side from that far out is awful. I saw him punch a blocker save right into the middle of the ice. A D1 goalie ought to be able to direct those to the corner.
Yeah we have quite a few I believe the most noticeable one is Luca Munzenberger whose pretty average
it’s the frozen four my brother, any kid that can walk is gonna wanna play
Honestly I can forgive a double screened throwaway shot going top cheese from a shit spot, the two deflection goals were lazy as hell. I swear to God he just stares at the puck behind the net while he was in a dangerous spot to be banked off of.
Which one? There was two of those bank shots from behind
Luca has NHL level physicality, but college refs (esp out east) call games a lot tighter. I think next season is key for him. Not sold on his puck skills rn and he's gonna have to improve those since we're losing our top two guys in that regard  Joel Määttä leveled up a bit this year, he's more of a defensive center that can occasionally chip in points. There was an article a while back about how Todd tells his players to watch NHL guys that they play like and the specific one mentioned was Määttä with Adam Lowry (who Woodcroft coached in Winnipeg)
Kravtsov has been less productive with the Canucks than he was with us and somehow there’s still some Rangers fans blaming the coaching staff for just not playing him more
Hawks are clearly tanking
He's been pretty meh so far. This game he looked different though. It looked like he realized, or someone told him, he's big and he can hit.  If he keep up this playstyle he'll fit in nicely in the bottom 6.
He’s been needing to realize his size for 5 years now. He was a reach when we drafted him but he had the frame and talent develop into something. He could have benefited from some developing in the AHL but he was not interested in that.  Honestly if he puts in the work to use his size and play as a power forward - he can possibly be even more than a bottom six guy. But I think him going back to Russia next year is more likely than that
Well that's not going to be overblown and blamed on any one specific player.
Can he play for Seattle since he was already playing pro? Or since he got sent down the call up date passed
Games were:  5-3 4-0 6-3 5-1  Not particularly close either. Let's go Rangers!
Windsor moved a ton of assets at the deadline to get Wright - what a disaster. Has there ever been a 1 vs 8 playoff upset in the CHL of any kind, let alone a sweep? I'm pretty old, and I certainly don't remember one.
As a Rangers seasons ticket holder, fuck yeah that was awesome.
One Brett Harrison to Providence, please and thank you
Has a #8 seed beat a number 1 seed in the OHL before? I would think it’s pretty rare since usually the 8 seed is not particularly good
Just the one Ranger?
Sad plane noises
As someone currently living in kw, and also cheering for the Mooseheads, this has been a fun week
Well that’s a disaster for Wright and the Kraken. Certainly not on him, but they specifically kept him from the OHL until the deadline to get him on a better team with a chance to win, and it’s just backfired spectacularly. Windsor should be thanking their lucky stars that the OHL won’t let you trade 1st round picks, otherwise they’d be back in the stone ages.
How was the Ranger's goalie playing? He was looking great in two games I saw earlier this month. The whole team seemed well composed actually. I think it's a case of peaking at the right time.
Hey Shane, you had the chance to go to Barrie and said no.  just saying.
Windsor gave up like 2 players and like 7 picks to get him too lol. From the accounts out there he seems very self entitled. And I mean, at that level, with how good he thinks he is, he should have been able to will his team to a round win, let alone a win
I'm disappointed with the lack of Tampa Bay copy pastas, and I'm working, so I can't do it.
The Kitchener Ranger must know they sound like an appliance... Right?
Does that mean he can play for Canada at the world championships? I think those happen early may?
We don't have any words...
Oh no.  Anyway
Yessir
BUST
what a fucking joke. dont care that they’re kids, that’s embarrassing
I forgot all about this kid after he pouted around for not being drafted first
Man the two of the top 4 picks from last year are looking quite shit
Woop woop   -Rangers fan
Shane Wright doing his best to end his OHL career early so he can get a few games in with the Kraken
Especially not by a certain fanbase.
Filip Mesar >>> Shane Wrong
1 goal and 3 points in 4 games.  Can't blame him, but that's not going to change minds either, ya know?
Yeah they can bring him up whenever, but he couldn't play in the AHL this season and since he's a tweener right now, it was prudent to not burn a year off his ELC and just have him play in the OHL.  Unlikely he'll play any Kraken games, but he can go to AHL now.
He could play now since his jr season is over but probably more likely he goes to the AHL.
He fucking sucks.
If Tampa Bay showed us anything, than Windsor is winning their championships the next two years then.
Let’s go Rangers!
Game three was closer than the score, the Rangers scored two empty netters in the last minute
It's the first sweep by an eighth seed in OHL history and the first time an eighth seed as won a series in the OHL playoffs since 2005 when St Mike's beat Mississauga in 5.  As for the WHL, the only 1v8 upset in the last 15-odd years was last year with Vancouver beating Everett in 6.
a shit tonne of assets! :   forward Ethan Miedema, defenceman Gavin McCarthy and seven draft picks including: a second pick in 2023, a third-rounder in 2023, fourth-round picks in 2024 and 2025 a conditional sixth-round pick in 2024, and two conditional picks (a fifth-rounder in 2024 and a sixth-rounder in 2025).
Rangers season ticket holder and Buffalo flair. Long shot, but do you work at a place on Ottawa & Fischer Hallman?
Hopefully the baby Bs can make a run.
He was the best player on the Generals for the past two years but seems to fly under the radar
Last time it happened was 2005, first time that a 1 seed has ever been swept though. The Rangers have a really good team and just couldn't get it going consistently during the regular season
"It's the first sweep by an eighth seed in OHL history and the first time an eighth seed as won a series in the OHL playoffs since 2005 when St Mike's beat Mississauga in 5.  As for the WHL, the only 1v8 upset in the last 15-odd years was last year with Vancouver beating Everett in 6. "
Oh no, he gets to go to the AHL now
I mean, his WJC display was poor and now under PPG in the CHL playoffs.. that is on him. For someone that was supposed to dominate juniors he certainly failed at that.
What a disaster for him.
Costantini played amazing in goal but the real key for the Rangers was playing team defense and keeping the Spits mostly on the perimeter, something the Rangers have not done well (at all) for the whole regular season.  But they did it solidly for 4 whole games, hopefully they can continue it against London.

Really? Really, dude? With how things have been going for us lately, you have the nerve to poopoo the Rangers’ chances? *Really?*
How’s Tolvanen playing for you guys?  ……oh wait.
He had 37 points in 20 games.
Who is the other?
The downvotes are pouring in but you’re not wrong. Both Wright and Slaf have had a somewhat disappointing D+1. Slaf starting in the NHL was a huge mistake, couldn’t believe it when they announced it.  Wright was disappointing at the world juniors and just had a disaster playoffs. Slaf showed flashes but did not look good at the NHL level.  They’re extremely young and this doesn’t mean much in the big picture but it’s fair to point this out.
He heard NHL playoffs were more fun.
He’ll be headed to playoffs with Coachella Valley most likely.
Think he’ll have a shot at Kraken the lineup?  I’ll see myself out.
WHAT A BUST!!! PIECE OF SHIT BABY DICK LOSER!!!  Am I doing this right
Mesar did not contribute at all in the series
He could play one more game in the NHL without burning the year, but the Kraken would probably want him to get settled with the Firebirds asap.
In this week's: "corners of the CHL/NHL transfer agreement I learned about thanks to this dude": the 20 year limit only applies while the CHL team is in session. So now that Windsor is eliminated, they could (if they wanted to) send him to Coachella for the playoffs this season. And then next season he would go back to being ineligible for the AHL and he'd have to report to either the Kraken or Windsor.  Examples I was shown were Caleb Jones and Brayden Schenn. Each played AHL games as 19 year olds including playoff games after their CHL seasons ended.   Not sure if they would do this or not, as it would still burn a year off the ELC, but he'd definitely get to play more with Coachella.
Wouldn’t be surprised to see him come practice with the team during playoffs just for experience.
He played 5 games in the AHL this year though?
As far as I’m concerned he can’t play in the ahl until he’s at least 20. Is there something new that’s happened I’ve missed?
Not even close to likely.  Windsor mortgaged their future on this playoff run.
To be fair, it’s no surprise they lost if they had to play an NHL team.
In fairness, that Vancouver team was also the least-eighth seedy eighth seed I think I've ever seen in any level of hockey. Crazy just how many games they had that were agonizingly tight losses and tough injuries to swallow.
We won the long game by stealing the majors and making them the steelheads
Nah, I’m a teacher lol.  Trying to think of what is there… Tim’s, Canadian tire, dentist or eye care place I think. Never worked at any of those.
Seems like there are a whole bunch of Sens fans in the KW area (myself included), kinda interesting!
We clinched a first round bye with wednesdays win so I’m happy
Rangers have been a top team in the league since they fired their coach, 9-3-2 in their last 14 I saw. Also had a +17 goal differential on the season which was good for 4th in the div as opposed to the 8th place they finished in.
Nice. I figured it didn’t happen too often. And yes I remember in the pre season that the rangers were predicted to be a good team. Getting hot at the right time!
Feel like they would’ve wanted him to make a deep run where he was at. Sure he can come into Coachella now and make a run with them, but that has to be a bitterly disappointing result
He had 37 points in 20 games, Idk if I’d say he certainly failed.
Okay? He didn’t perform well with us, glad he’s doing fine with y’all. That had fuck all to do with what I said though
Sort expected from an overager, I dont believe he'll amount to much.
Slafkovsky
Sam Bennett did the same thing when he was drafted then went and tasted some Flames playoff hockey.
There’s not a Wright answer yet.
You could make a pun on his last name, otherwise solid performance.
Piece of shit baby dick loser suck on your mommy’s titties.
😤 You just didn't watch the games he brought the ***intangibles***
Well, he's been playing hockey for the last three months, which is better than we can say for Slaf.
Would playoff games count? I know they don’t count towards cap but but I guess I’ve never had to think about it in a situation like his before
AHL games would not burn a year off his elc. There's European players that come over to the AHL as teenagers and their ELCs slide (Sandin and Liljegren with the Leafs did this a couple years ago).   https://www.capfriendly.com/slides/2023
I’ve been told that last part of your first paragraph is not correct. Because Wright got exceptional status, he has now completed 4 seasons in the OHL and is no longer subject to the 20 year old limit. So his career in the CHL is over and he’ll be able to play all year for the Firebirds if that’s what the Kraken want to do with him.
"Conditioning stint" which has rules and regulations, can't park someone down in the A indefinitely on "conditioning stint."
The rule is to stop the AHL from poaching all the top CHL talents. Once a player's junior season is over they can join the AHL (you also see this with euro players).
Funnily enough, I've seen people say the same about Kitchener this year.
We're still basically best friends. Non-leaves fly together.
Yeah they were brutal under Dennis, I went to enough games where they played awful this year under him that I hope I don't hear his name again. MM been doing a great job since taking over
They would have preferred they won out but he played pretty well in the OHL and now gets to go to the AHL. Far from a disaster
If they’d gotten their first choice he would have been in the AHL this entire time. That wasn’t possible so they maneuvered to get him into a good situation with Windsor.  It’s a shame that their season ended prematurely, but him getting to play at Coachella is a positive.
Ehhh, in a perfect world he'd have been with the Firebirds all season but the CHL-NHL agreement forbids it. The Firebirds are really good and could make a deep run, so I don't see any lost opportunity if he's getting AHL playoffs instead of OHL playoffs.
And what you said had fuck all to do with the thread.
You did the same thing lmao. Don’t talk shit if you don’t want to take shit
He’s not an overager. He’s a D+1.  Next season he would be an overager.  37 points in 20 games is very good. The playoff performance can be criticized.  But I believe if you look at the 4 goals in 5 AHL games in his D+1, those metrics would put him in very rare company, and have him tracking nicely.  You could say the 4 goals in 5 AHL games is a small sample size.  But, then you’d have to apply the same logic to the 4 playoff games he underperformed in as well.
Based on?
It's his 18 year old season, overagers are 20.
Slafkovsky was dead for half the season.
> Slafkovsky  Was in the NHL at 18 and managed 10pts in 40 games before getting hurt. Not sure how you evaluate a season like that but "quite shit" is not it.
18 year old Sam Bennett?
fool me once, Shane on you!
Such a Shame Wright?
Zach Wilson says [“Where’s the mom!?”](https://people.com/sports/jets-qb-zach-wilson-seemingly-addresses-headlines-about-sleeping-with-moms-friend-what-i-miss/)
Haha, I'm all about intangibles. I was also wrong, he scored an important goal in the clinching game. Prior to that though, zip.  For real, Francesco Pinelli > Shane Wright?
Playoff games count. Boston burned McAvoy's first year in the playoffs because half their NHL dmen were hurt.
Much discussion on this. It's not just being around for 4 seasons. He has to have actually *played* 4 seasons, and they apparently have limits on the number of games played for the season to count? So technically, he could be considered to have only played 2 OHL seasons due to Covid cancelling one season and being on the Kraken roster so long this season. But do they give guys a pass on the Covid cancelled season? How do they enforce the games played limit? Etc.   I honestly have no idea. The CHL needs to have an easily referenceable copy of the transfer agreement somewhere (Or I need someone to link me to it). I'm only finding news articles talking about it, and perpetually being surprised by all the little ins and outs of it.
Ahh I see
I know it happens with euro and even college players. But is he allowed to play a handful of AHL games now that the CHL season is up? And then be stuck between NHL or CHL only come next season? That’s where I’m confused because I’ve never heard of that being the case
Out of curiosity, how did Quinton Byfield end up playing in the AHL immediately after his draft year? He was still only 18.
My dads a sens fan, I want us both to be good again so I can hate watch his teams games and he can hate watch mine
It’s objectively a pretty terrible result when he and the kraken chose his location. Not shitting on the kid, but that’s not the season they were hoping for him in the ohl
I would go so far as to say that is preferable.
Basically every metric saying he's not going to be a star, what reasons would you have to believe he would be a star?
If death is permanent that isn’t a good sign.
https://twitter.com/JFreshHockey/status/1615762987096346634?s=20  His season was pretty bad. So far he doesn't look like a good #1 pick.
MORE LIKE SHANE WRONG 🤣🤣🤣💯💯🔥🔥🔥💀💀📠📠
Ooh, points for showing some originality
Similarly the Avs burned the first year of Makar’s ELC in the ‘19 playoffs because he’s fucking disgusting
As a basement team am I able to say it didn’t help to the earliest president trophy winners ever? I’m going to either way, it didn’t help.   In all seriousness thanks for the answer, you guys wouldn’t be so shit if you didn’t steal big Z from me and my parents weren’t fans. Sincerely 1/4 of the sens fan base.
McAvoy isn’t relevant in this context. When McAvoy signed his contract if he played 0 seconds he still would have burned a year of his ELC because it wasn’t slide eligible as he was turning 20 in the year that he signed his contract.
FWIW I saw an article about the OHL playoff upset and the future of the Spitfires and it stated that Wright was definitely not going to be there next year.
Yes if the players CHL season is over they can play AHL. We did this with Morgan Rielly the year after we drafted him. Moose Jaw lost so he was sent to the Marlies to finish the year.
Yes he is allowed, as per the CHL Transfer Agreement which is in effect until at least 2029. Wright must play in the CHL or the NHL next season, as he doesn't turn 20 until January 5th. If he turned 20 on December 31st or earlier, he would be eligible to play in the AHL as a 19 year old.  &#x200B;  It does happen where we see CHL players play a few games in the AHL at the end of their season, but it's not super common largely due to timing. Off the top of my head, I know Jordan Eberle did this for a few games after Regina was eliminated, then he returned to the WHL at the start of next season.
Based on my understanding yes. He could go play with Coachella Valley til the end of their regular season (though I don’t think he’d be eligible for playoffs because he wasn’t on the roster at the AHL trade deadline). Then next year he’d either have to be in the NHL or CHL because he’d still be under 20.
Man, I miss those Briere/Drury days. I loved the slug Sabres so much.
How so? He played on a much better team than Kingston and pretty significantly improved his point production. Now he gets to finish off the season vs better competition in the AHL.
Not being a star is not the same as not amounting to much.   But what are these metrics saying he won't be a star?
You still haven’t shown anyone those secret metrics lol
this combined with your user name has me dying. hahaha
The kid was uncouth!
And no college player is leaving earlier to not have a year burned
Does Makar count in this context? I feel like when people talk about burning a year of an ELC they’re talking about a slide eligible contracts Makar’s contract was never slide eligible he just signed after his NCAA season for the current season instead of the next season.
Nah nah McAvoy was really good that series, I remember being mad about it. I was scared when he was on the ice. Karlsson and Stone were just so good on that playoff run, I feel they won on individual efforts against the flow of play.
Oh yeah, it's probably all moot, as I have little doubt he'll easily crack the Kraken roster for next season.
That’s cool to know thanks, I was only partially following the nhl at that point so didn’t know about that
He's technically been in the OHL 4 years because of his exceptional status, so he should be able to go to the A next season.
Someone else commented that since he has been in the OHL 4 seasons he would be AHL eligible next year regardless of age.
I miss hating that red headed fuck who was really good at hockey.  Have since developed more respect than hate for him, but man did I hate him at the time.
He improved from 1.5 PPG to 1.85 PPG, a jump I would’ve expected regardless of where he was playing. If that’s all they wanted plus 4 playoff games they wouldn’t have bothered to pick his team in the first place. Hope he does well in the A, but I think you’re fooling yourself if you think Francis or Wright would call the second half of this season in the ohl a success.
Instead of a deep playoff run where he's a top player/leader on a junior team, he's back to being a rookie. Plus the confidence knock of being on the wrong end of a historic sweep.
Spittin' all out the sunroof, through his missing tooth
Which center would he replace? Geekie is the fourth liner, but he's been pretty good. I would start Wright in the AHL next year and see what happens. If he dominates then swap him for Geekie, or trade Wennberg.
That’s right, 4 years in junior would make him AHL eligible as well.
That is a pretty significant jump and was 2nd highest in the league only behind a fellow top 10 pick in Brandt Clark who is a year older than Wright.
Okay but what happens now if he is a key player on a deep AHL run? Playing against more grown men i think is more important to him because he won't be asked to be a clear leader in Seattle. Honestly the biggest thing he needs is to get used to get used to the physicality of other leagues and that will happen more in the AHL
Geekie and Gourde can both play wing. Could see him slotting into the 3rd line? Wouldn't be shocked to see one or two guys on the way out.  Burakovsky, Wennberg, Schwartz   McCann, Beniers, Eberle  Bjorkstrand, Wright, Gourde  Tanev/Tolvanen, Geekie, Sprong/Donato?  Dunn, Larsson  Schultz, Oleksiak  Evans, Borgen  Soucy and maybe Donato out to make roster room for Evans and Wright, and to clear cap space for re-signing Dunn and Borgen?
Wow I didn’t know it worked like that either. So many little rules that almost never happen it’s cool to learn new ones like this.
Do you think he makes that same jump with Kingston? Because I do. I’ll make this very simple. We didn’t have Dylan Guenther’s rights traded from Edmonton to Seattle for him to put up some regular season points then get their asses handed to them in a 4 game sweep. If you asked Dylan and Bill Armstrong they would categorize that result as a disaster. You want these guys making memorial cup runs, and if they don’t achieve that lofty standard you’d at least like a deep run in their league. There’s goals laid out when these plans are made, and losing as early as possible to join the ahl affiliate isn’t one of them. Genuinely wish Wright the best, seems like a good kid, but this is a bad result, that is the only point I’m trying to make as laid out in the original comment
On the other hand, what if he struggles in the AHL? The playoffs aren't the best time to move up to a more physical league. He's had 4 eligible seasons in the OHL now, so it's not that he's missed the boat on the AHL if he doesn't go now. Finish his junior career on a high note (or at least not an embarrassing sweep) and start next season in the A full time.
It's interesting because we have a lot of "Good but not great" guys. Is Wright worth knocking one of Tanev, Tolvanen, or even Sprong or Donato out of the roster? Tanev and Tolvanen I just think are really strong and I know Sprong and Donato are streaky but I guarantee if they wind up playing somewhere else there will be a game where they score the winning goal against us. Plus I like Sprong because it feels like we basically rescued his career.
I dont think he would have because Kingston was an absolute dumpster fire. The goal was to get him anywhere better than Kingston.   It isnt ideal but he now gets to play against better competition in the AHL playoffs. If they could have kept him in the AHL all year they would have
In his first stint in Coachella Valley he walked right in and put up about a goal per game, so I kinda doubt they're all that worried about it.
I'm not saying it is ideal or anything but it is far from something that is going to dramatically hold back his development. He looked good in his first stint in the AHL, there is no reason to assume he is going to struggle now.
Jason Robertson has 13 points in his last 4 games. 4 goals and 9 assists. He's getting hot just at the right time.
I've never told anyone this story before... Late one night a few weeks ago I was driving on I35. There's a flash across the road in front of me. I slam on the brakes but it's too late. There's a huge crunching noise, my airbags deploy, and I careen off the road into a ditch.I guess I blacked out but after a few seconds I come to and kick my door open. My truck is trashed. I figure I hit a huge deer but there's no blood.I stagger back to the road and, get this, standing there calm as can be is Jason fucking Robertson. He's shirtless, got a light sweat going."I was out for a post-game jog and didn't see you coming. Really sorry about your truck, dude." My truck is totalled and he doesn't have a scratch on him. Then he turns and just jogs off into the darkness.
Starting to feel like 1999
Lol
I think that came with the contract for Pavs.
r/Churchofsaros
When was the last time the Preds didn't have a top tier starting goalie?
Can we go back to COVID style divisions and have this guy traded to the Kings or something so he never plays us again?
So just snipe it backhand between the legs forsberg from the inner slot. Am I missing something here?
I wish they would average goals above expected per games played to paint the full picture. Its still impressive to play so well over so many games but goalies who plays more will have the more goals saved above expected on the season assuming they're having a positive impact (ex vezina comparisons).
How much of that was from tonight and the last time he played the Canes when he had like a 50 save night? Not saying he hasn't deserved these stats, rather, he seems to hate us and stand on his head.
Cool stat!
Who’s first on inner slot chances?
The better Saros does the more I get excited about Wolf.
Time to add to my niche fanboy subs, along with r/JiManChoi
🙏 🥅 ⛪️
What's even crazier is the Preds seem to have a generational tier goalie on their AHL team. Askarov is insanely good. He's also just a generally insane player.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uj7rZh9e-YI
Mike Dunham
This is one of the things I find frustrating about facing them, they forever seem to have a Roy/Hasek re-gen in between the pipes, even if the rest of the team is occasionally a shambles.
I wouldn't worry about it.  No matter how good he is he can't carry a team.
Canes: try and force the puck through his chest like he’s a cartoonish ghost, got it
How is this downvoted? Solid joke
> How much of that was from tonight and the last time he played the Canes  This was shown during tonights game and didnt include stats from tonight.
He plays pretty much the same every time he’s in there.
Pavelski?
I'm so glad he's on the Pirates now. I can be a Choi Boi without having to feel dirty about liking someone on the Rays.
r/pierremcguire
sheesh, some steal their goalie scout
Damn it
Funny enough, same answer for the Rangers.
He literally has been all year. We'd be in contention for Bedard if it weren't for Saros. (Honourable mention to Lankinen who's been a stellar #2 this season as well)
He has literally carried Nashville all season lol.  Our leading point scorer doesn’t even have 60 points lmao.
Sometimes his positioning and movement is so good that it just looks like players are aiming at his chest
that and D-men are the only thing we can draft/develop. Offensive talent comes here to fizzle and die
Yeah, I get that. But he's also not going to carry the team to a playoff spot where the east is going to have to worry about him.
Our leading point scorer is an injured defenseman. :(
... okay cool, I get that.  I've acknowledged that.  Turns out that it won't be enough for Saros to be a threat to an eastern team.  That would mean Saros carries the Preds to the finals.
He seems phenomenally good at reading the play as it develops, discerning how it ends, and positioning himself accordingly. Dude is very rarely *not* in the right place at the right time
The canes do that with every goalie though, from Vasilevskiy to a rando making his NHL debut
Not anymore my friend! We seem to have finally figured out how to develop forwards! Just took us 24 years
Not that I think the Preds will actually do anything, but I don't see how you can say that with so much confidence. He's undisputably one of the best goalies in the NHL, and he's never actually had a chance at playoff hockey before.
Why are you so passive aggressive? Insecure about being disagreed with on a Reddit thread? Take a breath bud lmao
I replied to a Canes' fan.  Then re-iterated that I didn't think Saros would carry a team to a place where they'd have to face him.  I guess there are people that think that the Preds that are crawling in to the playoffs will get carried in to the finals.     Saros *IS* one of the best goalies in the league but it turns out he's not going to be able to score many goals to carry the very injured Preds to the finals.
wat?  I commented to a Canes fan saying he was worried about having to face Saros.  I said he shouldn't worry because Saros couldn't carry a team.  I *figured* people would realize I meant that Saros couldn't carry a team to the finals since the person I was responding to was a Canes fan, which would be the only round that matchup could happen.    Relax dude, I totally acknowledge that Saros is a badass.  I mentioned it years ago that I was always more afraid of Saros than I was of Rinne because Saros would shut the Avs down hard.
Oh yeah, that's fair, I missed that it was originally a Canes fan you responded to. Preds in their current state are putting together a valiant effort but you're lying if you've heard of anyone who scored a goal tonight, and Juice can't do everything himself.
It’s good bro it just felt passive aggressive and I was worried you might be going through something
Yeah, I wasn't talking shit about Saros.  Even before Rinne retired I felt like the Avs had a worse record vs Saros.  I'm not talking shit about Juice, just saying that he's not going to be able to carry the Preds to the finals.
... weird but okay.  That's a deep take by thinking I don't think your team's goalie is good enough to carry them to the finals and immediately associating that with me having some personal issues.     I appreciate you looking out, though.
You mean the exact thing Rinne did in 2017? Squeaked into the playoffs as an 8 seed rinne carried us to a cup final.
Worlds crazy man, gotta care about the people
Yeah, you're right.  It happened once so it is totally gonna happen again.  My bad.  Preds are like 3 points out of a Wild Card spot right now so its absurd of me to think that they wouldn't end up in the Finals on Juuse's shoulders.
I saw it and squirmed. Fucking unfortunate for Jeannot.
Thats a lot of grit to miss come playoff time. Damn. Hope they get well soon
Damn…
Yeah, I saw it and cringed as well. Hopefully, it's not as bad as it looks but yeah that didn't look good at all.
Yea thats not supposed to do that
Still astounded how the Preds are in this after selling at the deadline. Man that's some incredible team chemistry and work ethic.
More and more I’m getting convinced that saros deserves the vezina this year especially if the preds somehow make the playoffs
Nashville JUST WONT DIE
Blocked shots  Canes 3  Preds 26
Raise a banner - 20+ blocked shots against the canes
4 shutouts in 15 games is fucking unacceptable  There’s a very real chance this team finishes 2nd in the division and ends up with the rangers in the first round.
Nino sweating right now
We could actually do this
saros owns us
Saros has had some year vs Carolina. First the 60+ save performance and now this
As long as this motivates the Preds to beat the Jets, I'm fine with it
Holy shit Preds. What the fuck
Preds late platoffs push is getting interesting
Hell of a 3 way race for that last spot.
All Hail Juuse Saros!
Preds could be in a playoff spot come Saturday. Crazy
What an *experience*!
New day. Same issues. Big experience
Yo preds are on a TEAR rn I actually hope they make it in because they are really giving it their all in the final run. It would truly suck to see them put in all this work to just miss it.
I wish this team knew how to actually score a goal at this time of season
LETS FUCKING GO! THANKS JUICE
PAIN.
Why
Predators are going all in on the playoff push. And if they make it in, they could be scary.
"We like our group." - Don Waddell on deadline day  Our group:
I have come from the future to congratulate New Jersey on winning the division and New York on an easy five game round one.
Idk what was worse the play tonight or PK on broadcast.   He’s honestly the worst at calling a game. It’s so much fun having a homer for the team chasing the canes call a game and shit on the canes and pump the devils tires.   ESPN broadcasts are such a joke
I don't wanna play Florida tho
Canes want us to get the shirts and hats
The kids are alright!
I just wish Hynes had been more willing to play our younger players from the start and not when he was forced to by selling at the trade deadline and due to injuries.  Imagine if we still have Jeannot and Tolvanen in this lineup.   So frustrating and I hope Hynes doesn't get too much credit for this.
I think they're playing with a lot of passion and emotion to give the city some happiness after the recent tragedy as well.
His goals saved above expected stats are crazy.
Tbh the Vezina this year is one of if not the most impressive in years. Ullmark, Saros, Sorokin and Oettinger. Vasi and Helly are really good as well.
More blocked shots than shots  It's the Preds way
I think a first round exit might be better at lighting a fire under management and the players asses than a second would
It absolutely sucks to be good all season then fall apart right at the end. I thought this was a cup team a few months ago, now it’s just sad.
And then yall after hopefully :)
Canes are in pre-playoff form
Besides Josi being Swiss, got no horse in the race, but man the Preds making it would be quite a story.
Tennessee BBQ >>> NC BBQ
Carolina made a mistake not loading up this deadline imo
Svech wasn't injured until after the deadline, was he?  Still fucking sad that instead of stepping up while he's gone, we deflate like a sad balloon.
Doomer. It's not over yet cmon.
I feel like NJ has been within ~1 point of the division lead like 5 different times. Canes just like keeping it close and giving false hope.
I’m a PK fan and I love Kevin Weekes, not so much Cally, but that was a bad broadcast. Very boring and the play by play was pretty bad. They should both stick to being desk analysts in my opinion.
Lol you still got some work to do
What about the pesky isles?
*Hard earned points
Yeah looking at his expected goals against compared to all the other top goalies just tells the story of the differences in defence they get to play behind.
If Lyon played like he did tonight all year then he would be in the mix too..
Yeah, maybe we'll get a stat from their Twitter team about how many STM's canceled after this season.
Considering how Pastrenak scored in the last 2 seconds of a game a couple of weeks ago to ruin a shutout in Boston. This feels like the universe balancing out.
Frig off!
We already lost, there's no need for slander
I hope your Dunkin is stale and cold tomorrow.
Which part of TN?
Imo it almost would’ve been a lost cause. I’m not sure one goal scorer would’ve put us over the top. If we had one of Patches and Svech healthy then yeah I would agree. But say we got Meier, I’m not sure he alone turns us into a cup contender.  Aho and Necas are the only healthy players on our team with more than 20 goals.
idk, Ive seen for the last few years that next year is their big window.   Sure they could have loaded up this year and next, but it might have been for nothing this year anyways, and it was a crazy arms race. The core is signed through next year, the surrounding pieces should be easy to bring back, Staal's 6 mil will be dropping, leaving tons of money to spend in the offseason, or at the deadline. Plus Patches has indicated(of course nothing official on this) that he might want to stick around. Given how his season... *seasons* have gone, he's probably taking both a pay cut, AND a performance bonus heavy deal.
Yeah. Can't really blame him for not predicting that one of our leading scorers would get a season-ending injury a couple weeks after the deadline, but we'd been needing another goal scoring winger for *years* before he went down. Had we gotten one, maybe we'd still have a chance instead of being an easy out.
Doesn’t help that Two of our best three goal scorers are shelved for the year. The Patches injury happened before the TDL but yeah the timing of the Svech injury was unfortunate.
The playoff part yeah but I truly don’t see how Devils don’t win the division. Not only are they winning, they are winning handily in a way that we aren’t when we win.
Weekes isn’t too bad as a color analyst/commentator but he’s not cut out for the play-by-play role
we're doing 90% of it for them
Also the insane level of injuries to our defense
In literally the last second. Less than half a second was remaining
Hey guy, get frigggged!
I got a Box of Joe from catering this AM so it will be stale and cold tomo TYVM.
Completely agree. If y’all had those two guys, you would have totally blown out the Admirals.
Um Norfolk is the worst team in the ECHL by 8 points
Delusional. We controlled a majority of the possession in that game.
It's the 3rd year in a row we've started our year extremely strong and then limped into the playoffs just to have an early exit.  Every game we "dominate" and outshoot our opponent just to get shutout.  It's feeling scripted at this point.  Make sure you get maximum value for your STM this year by selling your playoff tickets to a Cary Rangers fan at a massive markup.
Of course, and if he's not 100%, hell, 110%, he has a life after hockey that he deserves to be able to live.  But if everything checks out, and he wants to give it a go, his contract will likely be set up well to not be a huge impact on the other moves the canes could make. His base salary will probably be quite low(see aging injury prone player), And I'm no cap expert, but he qualifies for performance bonuses, which as far as I'm aware has some benefits too.  Basically, if he's done, he's done; no sweat. If he wants to and can come back, its unlikely he's the difference in having enough cap space for a big name player in the offseason because of what his contract will likely be. If the worst happens and he gets injured again, it will likely happen by the deadline, and they have the LTIR space to work with, and hopefully he can recover enough to not have any long term quality of life issues.
Which means nothing, because we have no finish.  Same old story of outshooting our opponent by 2x and still getting shutout.
That's fine but we didn't play worse than the last place ECHL team.
>We're 2nd in the league right now!   Playing great for the first half of the season and creating a massive division lead means absolutely nothing if we collapse right before the playoffs.  This is the 3rd year in a row it's played out exactly like this. It's no longer bad luck, competition, etc, etc. The boys just check out after the all-star break and undo the phenomenal season they've played up til then.  NJ shouldn't even be close to us right now. But because we're losing over half our games, there's actually a good chance they'll pass us.
That's debatable. They'd have probably at least scored one.
🙄
Kuzmenko has 38 goals. People laughed when we compared him to Panarin.
Get rid of the Makarov rule and give this guy the Calder.
That’s who I thought of when I checked his stats, unreal first year
27% shooting% isn't sustainable. He's gonna regress in sophmore year but he's got the talent to make it as Peterson's #2 in a couple years
I don't know..I'm pretty sure I could shoot 27% with Petey softly laying biscuits on my stick 1 foot from the goal line all year.
GG rangers.  I fucking miss Vova. :(
I love you Vova
I don’t think we get enough talk about how shit we are in OT lol. GG StL
Cheeks Klapanen
I mean sure… We kinda suck at this 3 on 3 thing somehow…
Does Buch just seemed irritated as a natural facial expression?  Even when he smiles he seems slightly hacked off.  His penalty was a joke, but he played a super strong, physical game.
This game was always going to feel deflated after Tampa and to lose is disappointing, but I'm fully in playoff preservation mode now.  Side note, the respect Blues fans have for Tarasenko is SO wholesome. I've said since day one, you can tell a lot about a player by the reaction of the fanbase he's leaving. As wild as all the Kane hype was, Tarasenko was the deal of the window for me.
For those who said Halak sucked, no he did not fucking suck. This Ranger team was asleep the entire game and woke up late 3rd, only to get back to smoking weed in OT. Key with the huge turn over, and Trocheck & Panarin focusing on the same player. Anyway. GG Blues! We love Vova!
I'm still kind of livid on that Buch penalty. Literally a nonexistent tripping call made worse by our PK method of letting a goal in on the first 10 seconds to end the penalty sooner
Boo hiss
Considering every one of our players was drugged, I’ll take a point.
Ah well, GG blues bros.
GGS thank you for playing a mostly clean game where no one was hurt. Only the slash on Mika was 😤
Thank you Blues. 😉
That game had preseason vibes after the slugfest last night vs Tampa.
Might have been one of the slowest games of the season lol
It was nice to see how much Vova and the STL fans cared for each other. Apparently he also made a big donation to the Wash U Childrens Hospital. I hope we treat him right, he seems like a good one.
I've always liked Vova and was thrilled when the Rangers landed him. He's played great since coming over.  GGs ButtholeConnoisseur!
No 3 on 3 in playoffs.  Not worried about it
Of course he claps them cheeks in St. Louis. All it took was a different coach for him to break out of his shell.
I may get some hate, but most of the time we look really bad in 3v3 is when Bread is out there. His aversion to defensive responsibility is even more noticeable with less guys out there. Sure he backchecked on the goal, but he managed to screw that up by not going to the right man.
Resting Buch Face, Captain Happy, take your pick from the old nicknames.
Glad Vladdy is happy there
it was not that egregious of a call lol
Cardio game - go out, skate, don’t get hurt.
He's one of the most beloved players to ever wear the note.   I hope he gets hot in the post season for yall.  Definitely the eastern conference team I'll be rooting for.
Hope he continues to play great in the post season for yall!
Regulation W-L:  Canes: 37-19  Devils: 38-21  Rangers: 36-21  Division is pretty close if you don’t count 3 v 3 or shootout.
fair enough
3v3 is the real problem for us - 6-10 in games that end in OT and 4-2 in shootouts.
Shoutout that one salty leafs fan in the PGT who taunted McAvoys injury   Most of you guys aren’t bad but holy shit that one guy can get bent
Yeah I didn’t think it was that bad when it happened. I’ve been wrong before but I didn’t see it seriously bad unlike that coffee guy who just kept praying for him to be seriously injured
Wishing ill on a injured play is trash behaviour. Sorry about whoever did thar
If their name start with Coffee then thats the known degenerate troll. Tho it might be banned by now. They keep being banned and making new accounts. When we sniff em out we usually will post a warning in the GDT for other fans to block them.
Not a true hockey fan in any sense of the word.
Somebody in the Leafs GDT did too and we blasted him for it. Fuck people like that. If we end up playing in the playoffs i want jt to be full strength
Toronto cheering after KD tearing his Achilles was one of the worst I’ve seen in terms of bad manner    https://youtu.be/aFnFHX_XbWQ
GDTs are always the worst fans. I love live discussion and I won’t even go in them. I hate McAvoy cause he’s insanely good and he’s a bruin, but the man is solid. Hope he gets thru whatever it is so he can lose the right way
Usually Tampa fans are 1/2 that bad “dahlin head butted Cernaks elbow” so do did okposo
You can find him super easily if you want on the thread I just don’t want to directly give him attention   He went on a rant about how the refs rigged the game against Toronto and when anyone replied to it he called Boston a bunch of racists and then said poked at McAvoy’s injury.   Again most of you guys aren’t bad but that guy is the reason I root for Toronto’s downfall, the same way people root for Boston’s downfall because of the shitty Boston fans or Pittsburgh’s downfall because of the shitty Pittsburgh fans.  Edit: mods deleted his comments, or maybe he did our of shame. My reply to one of them is still up as well as others, fuck that guy
I will always say Fuck Toronto as much as a Toronto fan says Fuck Boston. And that's fine. But we, as a hockey community, will NEVER okay wishing harm on another player. We are all here to watch our teams win and play hard. But player safety should be top of the list for every fan.
Not our coffee, he is a good guy. I didn’t known the leafs also had a coffee
As do I, I’d kill to see the bruins fully healthy for the first time. We’ve never seen the Hall-Coyle-Bertuzzi third line yet
what? Fans do that all the time. Not a Toronto thing. Couple you might remember:  https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/bs-infuriated-over-montreal-fans-cheering-charas-injury  https://www.yardbarker.com/nba/articles/celtics_fans_cheered_when_lebron_james_suffered_leg_injury/s1_127_25682132
[This you guys?] (https://www.yardbarker.com/nba/articles/celtics_fans_cheered_when_lebron_james_suffered_leg_injury/s1_127_25682132)
ours is not good coffee. It's sludge made with waste sewage water. I don't know what their current name is but Leafs fans will try to point them out for opposing teams to block because they are the worsttttt
Did you even look at the article you shared?
Congratulations on using google to help find a 10 second clip to fit your argument
Yes?
Look, cheering about KD’s injury was bad. But bringing up that clip as a slight against the whole city and then getting upset when the same is done to you is pretty silly.  Fans get in that herd mentality all over the sports world. 99% of the time fans will cheer only when the player gets up and they’ll applaud him and only mean good intentions.  Interesting that you’ll pick that to be the indicator of how Leafs fans are rather than when they (twice) sang the American anthem when the audio didn’t work…or how the other night they cheered for the Blue Jackets goalie who stopped 46 of 49 shots in his NHL debut.  You get upset when others Cherry pick moments based on your replies, but you’re ok with you cherry picking when uncalled for?
 The Lyon King is a hell of a nickname
they should sign him to a 10x8 extension
The panthers have a knight and a king and the best officer on the case. What a dynamic trio!
Bro is making a late push for the Vezina
I'm gonna need y'all to stop being so likable.
Presidents trophy deep run, nah fam.  Squeaking in and sweeping the president's trophy winners, yaaaassssss
[🦁👑](https://youtu.be/OtW56LFwxGo)
Maybe I've avoided following Florida for...reasons...this season, but what happened to Knight? I thought he was the answer in net for the Panthers?
They are going to get past the 1st round aren't they?
Panthers org: why play $10 million goalie when less than $1 million goalie do trick?
Why can’t the Flyers find a goalie like Alex Lyon?   /s
Get yourself a goalie with an animal nickname. Seems to be a good strategy.
If we gotta see our old friend round 1. 😭
I…killed…Mufasa!
Single handily helping panthers fans forget about the Ben chiarot trade and the draft pick zito gave up. Was legit worried toward the middle of the season it was going to be a good pick for MTL
Sad Bobrovsky sounds
Ride the Lyghtning! This year’s Hamburglar.
Knock it off
Cringe tweet
Ooof I was bummed the ‘canes let him go. But now, I’m still bummed.
If he was still with us wed have the lyon hart tandem which was a cool name
Better than Tiger King
Careful, Dale Tallon may hire you
This needs to be an Adult Swim cartoon.
TBH, right back at ya.
Naw, you guys deal with Boston!
Players assistance program (rumor is that it’s mental related, not drug related)
Entered a player assistance program for an undisclosed issue, could be depression, anxiety, and/or substance abuse.  We’re all just pulling for him to get better and hopefully join us again next season.
I’d laugh my ribs off if they beat Boston CBJ style
The pick only drops if they make the ECF, so there is still hope!
They have 14 million commuted in net next year and this guy is arguably better than both of them lol
Dustin wolf 👀
Bob would be happy for him
Bob needs the rest. Maurice was running him into the ground right before he got sick. If Lyon's luck runs out, then it's good to have a well-rested Bob to pick up the slack
Bob’s been working with him on prepping for games.
I’d like that. I need to know how he was always able to work out of cap hell
Or Lou
How is a team with Benn likable
Dang - hopefully he gets the help he needs.
I would very much enjoy making you laugh your ribs off.
I will love it and I think I deserve it
Some pretty dope numbers in the AHL ngl
From everything I've seen, that's incredibly accurate. Guy seems like a legitimately nice individual. Always smiled and gave knight all the positivity you could ask for off the bench.   Also Lyon came right out and said Bob worked with him for his game against Toronto, telling him where matthews beat him which led to a really nice save on Lyons part about five games ago.
Because they also have Marchment. We couldn’t afford to keep him but wish we could’ve.
Honestly, I'm a relatively newer hockey fan so I have no idea what Benn did to make an entire team not likable. From a non-hockey perspective, I like their colors/jerseys, and from a hockey perspective, I like Robo, Otter, and of course my boy Marchment.
It shows you how little management did in the off season and are now using games to evaluate  what they have. They did Boudreau and hung him out to dry.
[It's the most combined penalty minutes in an NHL game since November 5, 2016 (171 PIM: Canucks vs Maple Leafs)](https://twitter.com/SNstats/status/1644162399388196867?t=BuLOfvIPtmj6kR_vC0_fqg&s=19)
The people who love to tell you about the “pussification of hockey” are rock hard right now.
That's a Shoresy time kind of game
And half of that was sired by Keith Tkachuk
Old time hockey.  Eddie Shore.  Toe Blake.
As the great Mickey Redmond would say, "that's old time hockey, gang!"
Between this and the goals/SOG stats I feel like this was an interesting game
I known Ottawa likes to play a chippy game so they're no stranger to these kinds of antics, but respect to Florida tonight, both teams were sticking up for each other out there, and for a team that's been called soft this year, Florida seemed to really be sending a message with how they weren't going to back down.
Ottawa really went down kicking this week.
Average small town Junior C behaviour
Man that was a first period of rangers/flyers back in the 70s lol
Keith Tkachuk: Panthers are soft as hell, they need to play more like the Senators  Panthers: …and we took that personally
Not a single team stopped at 69 min smh.
As a Sens fan I think that was the most frustrating game I’ve ever watched. The Sens would dominate for 10 minutes being stuffed by some random goalie who apparently was made in a lab to be the best goalie to ever live just for the panthers to get puck for 20 seconds and score every fucking time. The refs completely lost control which is sometimes fun to watch but less when your team is getting blown out lol
Give yer balls a tug!
We’ve seen some old time hockey these past couple nights with Ottawa/Florida, NYR/Tampa and Seattle/Arizona. Love it.
Hakuna Matata motherfucker
All of this from Keith Tkachuk’s balls
Panthers fucked around and found out. Don't start throwing cheap shots and not expect pushback.
To be expected when there are two rats named Tkachuk playing.
That was the Ryan Miller vs Matt Martin game. Good times.
Lmao 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Good thing I have a coat to lay over my lap.  To quote Patton "I love it. God help me, I do love it so"
When you boys are done jerking each other off in the box, tell your moms to add more minutes to my phone so I can take em to the movies this weekend. Give yer balls a tug.
Rough math on the penalties list says that’s not far off.
You're forgetting Dit Clapper. ;-)
Piss on Eddie Shore!
With the amount of people that have called Florida out they had no choice.
Least chaotic low level junior game
Nice
fucked around and won 7-2* what did the Panthers find out exactly?
Didn't you guys get blown out by 5 goals and get knocked out of the playoffs? I don't think that's finding out from Florida's pov
Us? you guys started it when Brady went into Lyon and you guys kept on running into him
Dit Clapper is the GOAT old time hockey name.
They found out Ottawa isn't going to be playing games in May.
I'm quite fine with how the team played tonight, minus our goaltending (big minus). Played in their zone the whole night, dominated them physically and had a franchise record 58 shots.
Florida’s perspective of finding out is when Pittsburg and the islanders make the playoffs and they don’t
No, you guys started it when Matthew took a run at DeBrincat. Y'all fucked around and found out.
Also lost 7-2 lol
Took a run lmao, it was a clean check and you guys jumped him
Your captain needed to win and he was too busy in the box. Thats acceptable in the early or mid stages, not in a must win. If anyone fucked around, he did and he found himself out of the hunt.
Debrincat literally hit tkachuk dirty right before that lmfao stay mad buddy
Cat man be bad. Oh wait you're talking about that clean hit ? LMAOOOOO okay
Which I hear is a 5 goal difference
You guys both have big fat curly headed fucks on your team, relax
Must win for what?
There's something so hilarious about a fanbase of a team with a Tkachuk on it getting mad at a Tkachuk getting physical with their goalie.
Playoff contention, if they lost tonight which they did, that eliminated any chances of clinching. That's why that "e." is on their side of the standings now.
I'm not sure going from 0.1% to 0% counts as a must win game, but if that makes you feel better, then sure, it was a "must win game" for the Sens.
It has nothing to do with "Makes you feel better." If they won out, there's still would've been a chance at it, and better to have some chance even if its small than no chance at all, but their actions and unwillingly to remain disciplined robbed the franchise, themselves, and their fans of that potential chance, regardless how small it may seem.   Orlando Magic had next to no chance to get the #1 after they snatched up Shaq, and they still did. Anything can happen, most of the times its luck based.
Must win, as in if they lose they are eliminated from playoff contention. Must win, as in if they win there is still a chance. A chance is a chance. If you think a team should just give up because their chance is so small, I’d love to see you coaching any team besides the Panthers.
If at first you don’t succeed, try again!
*everything he touches turns to goals*
Bing Bong
that's a great call from josh!
Nothing bad has ever happened with the Leafs having home ice advantage, right?
I am ready to be hurt again
This years lightning team just isn’t as good as these past few years, their defensive depth is nowhere near the same. Leafs should win this imo. That being said it is the leafs…
Personally I’m cheering for the team in blue and white.
im so FUCKING PUMPED to be let down
[weeks from now]   And for the seventh straight year…
Lightning have not been playing well for the last while. This might be the Year Leafs make it outta the first round
Let the memes live! Let the memes live!
Gonna be captain obvious here but if the Leafs don't win this, well this team is going to be overhauled hard in the off-season.
Hit me with the !remindme thing if you wish, I am guaranteeing this.   Not only are the Leafs winning this series, it’s not even gonna take 7 games. Toronto has them beat everywhere but in net, and we’ve already seen Vasy is mortal. This is the year
The nhl should look into trying something new. But since they had kid rock playing the Allstar game 20 years after he was new...
This is the year the Leafs discover May hockey and spare us all from yet another year of Lightning in the Finals.
AS long as nobody screams "This goalie is better." at Vasy, yall will be fine
We need the old system back. 1-8, 2-7, 3-6, 4-5.
What could possibly go wrong?
Alright I'm starting to feel a weird thing... I think it's hope?  Someone squash it for me please before in turns into full optimism
This is the chance to get the monkey off their collective back.  All of the Leafs since 67 will be pulling for them in spirit - from Shaky Walton through Salming and Sundin and Cujo and Wendel.  Do it for Hockey Nation boys!
I can't wait.
Cool
2020 and 2021 were the peak Lightning Teams. 2022 they definitely got worse, but were still good enough to reach the finals (and likely win it if Point wasn’t injured).  But to be honest, this year the team simply isn’t as good as prior years, have lost so much depth and health from the salary cap and deep runs and imo (hot take) on paper it’s the worst Lightning Team, since 2014 or 2017. (2017 they only missed playoffs since half the team was injured). I mean just look at the quality and quantity of the players who have left the team in the past 3 years, it’s crazy. Look at our Blueline this year… yeah it’s pretty bad lol.  Still 100% believe in this team, but the Leafs are very good, and won’t be surprised if they finally get past the first round this year
What a surprise
This might be the year, Tampa is beat up and getting a little old. With that being said they still have the best goalie in the world.
I swear if we lose in the first round again I may just have to give up watching NHL hockey for a few years for the sake of my mental health. I don't think I could take it again
As a Leafs fan, I hope they win.  As a comedy fan though...
I'm unreasonably optimistic this year and I wish it would stop.
I feel so torn about this matchup...
7 isn't lucky for us.
Lightning looked like they lost two guys last night. Even before that, other than having Vasi, the Leafs had to be favored? I know it's mostly a meme but they had to be favored regardless.
Lightning look tired and like shit lately. If leafs can’t win this series then I don’t even know what else they can do. Just blow it up
And in other news, Toronto pharmacies see rise in demand for anti-depressants. Customers claiming it is "just in case".
I think we are definitely worse than previous years, but playoff Lightning is a different animal from regular season Lightning. This matchup has been essentially locked in since December, so games haven't been all that meaningful for months.
Well I hope for the fans’ sake they get past the first round. I know what it’s like to feel cursed.
Memers: "Omg, the leafs can't ever get past the first round 🤣"   Their first round opponents:
Another reason I'm tired of the divisional format. So many reruns.
It's TIME.  Time to subscribe to Steve Dangle.
Went great for them last time.
Please leafs, just win the first round for Steve, at least
Leafs *should* win this series. Lightning just don't look as good and they're getting injured. That said, Vasilevsky could still do Vasilevsky things and win it by himself.
We’ve known this for months.
I really want to see the Leafs do well but I also know the off-season will be really interesting if they lose in the first round again
Leafs are like 0-12 or something when facing their demons
It won’t matter, Tampa will still win.
Y’all can do it this year, beat them dirty raging assholes.
I’ve watched this one before…
Hopefully same result 2Nd straight year.
Just like I do in Toronto every spring sweep those leafs
You're welcome, Leafs
And for the 7 straight year eliminated in the first round !
Anybody look at the six Dmen Tampa are trotting out on a nightly basis? I’ll be surprised if this series hits six games.
I agree we should probably be the favorites but from a points record the only thing separating us from the lighting is 1 extra win and a bunch of OTL points. The "gap" isn't that big, this is still basically the same lightning team that's been to 3 Stanley cup finals in a row.
As a fan all I can say is that I absolutely love this. Love it when the same teams play each other each year.
If Keefe uses his brain and plasters ROR on Point the Leafs will win, they have the center depth.
Surely Toronto can break their first round jinx, right?       Right?
Do you want to know what the definition of Insanity is?
The leafs are due.  Just through sheer random chance they have to in one of these eventually, right?
And I care why? Oh wait.
Please end the lightning early so we don’t have to watch Pat Maroon get carried again
this will be a fun series to follow
100% serious, not even gonna watch the first round.
I honestly want you guys to win but if you lose in 7 now at least it will be epic.
Eliminate those fucks.
Giving high nothing bad ever happens to the Kennedys vibes.
Surely this is your year, right ? Right ???
Que up the Padme meme …..RIGHT?
To be fair, we’ve lost in game 7’s at home and away
This is the way
Last year, there was no shame in losing (in a vacuum, not considering previous defeats).  This year...Leafs are the favourites, they just are. I'm not saying they will win, just that they should.
 Two words: Vasilevskiy
Also, regular season Tampa means nothing
shutupshutupshutupshup don’t say it out loud
I’m not gonna jinx it because if I say it, they’ll win another cup, but I believe the restaraunt of the cup window for now is switching to its dinner menu.
This was true last year as well.
This was said in 2021  And 2022  ...Now its being said again, can you just say the Leafs look good and have a good chance and not underestimate the bolts?
The Leafs should've beaten Montreal, and we all know what happened there
Just kidding I hate them both
Uhhh it's obviously the team in white and blue that's gonna take the series.
https://media.tenor.com/AXMEDSnkaH4AAAAM/godzilla-let-them-fight.gif
They should both either wear there blues, or their whites.  Max confusion.
That old chestnut.
*angry Steve Dangle noises*
Pls no
To lose to boston in the second round
I’d be in favour of seeing them win in seven but getting swept in the second round to mix it up
That would be disappointing imo because they’re the best they’ve looked in decades.
Are they gonna somehow make them not the Leafs? Are we talking franchise change?
And they should. I’d want to keep Shanahan-Dubas but everyone else I’d be open to moving if they can’t win it again.  (How do I get the little leafs logo beside my name?)
I wouldn't be shocked if Leafs ownership turned into Gordon Ramsay throwing the blue team out of dinner service if they lost again.
People said this last year, but this year due to the implications of the Matthews doomsday clock it might be true.
Go team chaos !
Remindme! 6 weeks
Leafs dont have a Hedman
This is some monkey paw shit. I'm here for it, though.
I’m pretty sure May is the only month they haven’t played hockey this decade
It's June hockey the Leafs have never played.
Well... ABOUT THAT.  Ya' see the Rags just did that.
Barring sorokin, I think that vasy is probably the best goalie in the league and we know that
with 4 divisions now, it could be top 2 teams in each division get seeded 1-4 based on tiebreakers with seeds 5-8 being wild card. would allow for a lot greater variety.
Toronto
But isnt the core of kuch, stamkos,point,hedman,vasi all together and healthy?
>(and likely win it if Point wasn’t injured).  Bless your heart
Tbh, either outcome will be great in their own ways.
when my team isn’t involved- I generally root for the most chaotic outcomes. I find it entertaining. In this case, most outcomes could be pretty entertaining- imagine Leafs best Tampa only to face Boston in round 2 or something. Oof.
Yes. The ending is the greatest ever.
Nobody sweeps leaves in the spring bruv. Good effort though
Who will you guys play?
👀🍿
Lol jesus you're about to get downvoted by your own fanbase for this hot take.
First year as a fan, eh?
Welp Mark this down folks he just jinxed his team, now Vasy gonna get a shutty.
For all the self-depreciating Leafs fans, there's always some that are still overconfident and that's what makes eliminating them enjoyable still.   Counter point: Samsonov or glass bones and paper skin Murray versus Vasilevskiy. Poll the other 30 fan bases and ask which goalie they'd prefer.
Anal Mafia
If we lose in seven it just confirms we are living in a simulation.
I mean, there will probably be a riot if they lose in 7 again. Especially if it's at home. There's a lot a built up frustration on fans, especially when there's going to be a lot of people hammered that night.
Here's hoping that O'Reilly is the difference maker
Fuck.... you're right. We are the Kennedy's.
Yeah, I was trying to phrase it more diplomatically, but the leafs need to win this series. They’re flat out the better team and have been all year long. Not sure what direction you guys go in if you lose again, but it feels like it would be something drastic.
Yeah it wasn’t an embarrassing defeat, it’s just that they were defeated….again.
Sir… that’s um… tw.. never mind
Think the only way losing this series will be okay is if Vas goes super saiyan again. Which being playoff Vas is entirely possible.
> I fear no man, but that.. thing... it scares me
He gave up 6 and 7 goals to the Ass last year.  Just saying
Ok but what if Vasilevskiy suddenly discovers a burning passion for crocheting and decides this whole hockey thing isn't for him? Have you considered that?
Yup. As someone who also cheers for the Panthers I take regular season Tampa with a huge grain of salt. I’m not saying the Leafs won’t win but I won’t be surprised if Tampa looks like a completely different team a week from now
There's only one way to shut everyone up, and we haven't done it yet.
If the Leafa are the first course I'm here for it
HA, GOT EM!
Had me in the first half
I hate Tampa more. Atleast Toronto doesn’t intentionally injure people almost every game.
The feeling’s mutual.
This is the way
Same 😞
I just got got.
Nobody hates the losers
Ah, I like the way you think.
What’s the sound of Steve Dangle bashing his head against the side of the Scotiabank Arena anyways? 😂
Seeing them beat Boston is supposed to be my consolation prize.
Win and stay in Toronto.  Lose and get relocated to Quebec City.
Move them 60km down the lakeshore to Hamilton.
If the Leafs lose in the first round, even a beat down drag em out game 7 type series, management probably takes the fall for it.    Dubas the GM is w/o a contract, so needs a great performance from the team that has assembled in order to get a new MLSE contract
It's not like it hasn't been considered before. Back in the 80s, Oilers and Leafs were considering [swapping cities](https://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/leafs-and-oilers-almost-swapped-cities-pocklington-1.797182).
Look in the sidebar where it says 'get flair'
Its called flair, and depending on what browser/app you are using, adding it can be a little different, but you can usually find it in the sidebar of whatever app or browser you are using.  Edit: [click here and you should be good](https://old.reddit.com/r/hockey/wiki/flair)

Hedman isn't even Tampa's best defenseman this year.
Wasnt the Tampa-Leafs series last year in May?
Or in the last decade IIRC
Biased but when he's on Igor is at least at their level
I just want a system which means we play Toronto and Boston more than 4 times a year. This year, we only played Boston 3 times which is unacceptable.
Yeah they are, but they have played so many games in the past few years, way more than any other team in the league, and it’s starting to show. Hedman and Vasi, as good as they are, have not been as good as they were 1-2 years ago
Reverse the roles. Do the Avs win if Point is healthy and MacKinnon is injured?
yeah can't imagine not having our highest goal producer for our cup wins would've made a difference, especially someone who is notably incredibly clutch in overtime
I mean, in the 6 games: each team blew each other out once, and the other 4 games were 1 goal games (2 of which went to OT). I think Point makes a huge difference.
Cirelli and Point were injured.  ARE YOU 100% Positive the Av's win against a playoff healthy Point and Cirelli? TWO OF THOSE GAMES already went to overtime as it was. Like obviously you can't change the past and you guys won I accept that as most should but I will forever preach that the series possibly has a different outcome if the Bolts have of two their best playoff goal scorers healthy.
No? You’ve never used a broom for spring yard clean up?
No fuckin idea
Pens, Islanders or Panthers. Personally I’m rooting for the Isles. Sorokin would likely make the series more entertaining because he can be a game breaker all by himself. For sentimentality I’m hoping for the Pens, because I think the playoffs are just better with Sid in it. Even for a round
Leafs in 5. Keep talking yourself into thinking this is the same Bolts team as the past.
Groundhog Day
Or the leafs really love golf?
I really hope not, people who riot because of sports are morons
I remember the last time we had a riot after losing in 7.   It wasn’t pretty.
Is this Vancouver or Montreal?
I mean, it has quite literally happened more times than I can remember, I think Leafs fans are too numb to it to even have the energy to riot. It will just be sad.
If we loose again I honestly don’t even care what happens to this team .. until next year
Without much investment in, or really even facts to support what I'm saying, the leafs are unfortunately like...the Yankees traditionally are in baseball. A team that attracts talent through it's name, and the fact that it always has good players to attract other players due to throwing insane amounts of money at things. Even in a salary cap era you can make a player happy with advertisment dollars and other shit on the side. So you end up with these mega teams you just love to hate.   Matthews and Marner and Nylander and Tavares are just four huge talents and huge salaries that have been kicking around for a few years. I want them to lose not due to any hate for them or the city of Toronto, but just because I don't want that model to be the norm. Probably because across all sports, it leaves an Ohio team at a competitive disadvantage
Eight words: Game Seven Vasilevskiy
There’s plenty of letters for two words
The Assalanche?
Tbf ass is every mans weakness 😩
Leafs were nowhere near the team the Avs were last year lol.
This Leafs team is good but they ain't "us last year" good
He only gave up more than three in regulation once that series. He was very good. Granted, if the Leafs get three goals per 60 minutes, that’s still hard to win, but the Leafs aren’t the Avalanche.
Don’t jinx it by saying it though
yeah, uh, something came in the mail today
*first round :(.
You'll get your two cups and nothing more
Could be worse. At least QC will love them like their own.
Ooo real stakes
Bigger punishment would be if the leafs were demoted to the AHL and forced to be a farm team for Boston and Montreal
I like what the other poster said. If they lose they have to move the franchise to Quebec.
On the regular season, sure. Id take hellebuyck, shesterkin, and maybe sorokin over him. But in my opinion Vasy is the best goalie in the playoffs. He becomes just absolute ice. And quite frankly if I had to pick only one goalie on my team, it'd be him.
Good point forgot about him
Agreed, Bruins could use the extra points…..
The Avs shut down McDavid last year and all 4 lines were scoring. Nothing was going to stop the train.
The Avs shut down McDavid with no problem last year. We weren't going to be stopped.
I'm sure you do... but the Avs had just finished shutting down McDavid with no issue. I wouldn't have been worried.
I don't have to do that lol.  I do admire your resilience though. It must be hard that we've won more cups than you've won series.   I don't expect much this year but try not to let it go to 7.
Keep talking yourself into thinking this isn’t the same Leafs team that’s choked away a series win for over half a decade straight
Living in a golf simulator
I hope it doesn't, mostly because I fucking live in Toronto.
There was a "riot" at my elementary school. A bunch of fourth graders were marching around the school at recess chanting "THE CANUCKS SUCK" and they all ended up getting sent to the office
That description feels misleading, when they drafted 3 of the 4. Aside from Tavares, who is at best their third best player, they seem like a pretty typically assembled contender, with their stud #1 pick, a few other homegrown stars, and some solid complementary veteran additions via trades and free agency.
Vile, evil, sky, aisle, ski(s), skies, yes…
And yet they still put up 5 on him twice and gave him the most trouble of any team in the post season...
EPL-style relegation would certainly liven things up around here.
And we want to increase our lottery odds to terrorize y'all with Bedard, Fantilli or Smith for more than a decade. Win-win.
i'm not even saying the lightning necessarily would've won, but other than the two blow out games it was a close series.  having a healthy point probably would've made a difference in some of the games
Oilers also suck outside of their top line. It's not hard to shutdown a single line.
Congrats on the Cups you deserved both of them. Hey it was a great run just think the Leafs are much better this season nothing more to it than that. If it does get to seven games I would favour your team. Good luck.
Man who called the fun police? I'd have laughed my head off at that.
Lol I was actually out of fourth grade when the whole riot happened. It was so crazy, I remember playing Dark Cut when I heard about the loss and got a little upset over it. But my mom told me that it happens.
Yeah and they are nothing like the Yankees traditionally because the Yankees traditionally win.  The Canadiens are the Yankees equivalent, the Leafs are more like the cursed Mets
You're saying the lightning wouldn't have won still I'm saying the lightning wouldn't have won still... good talk.
But Points presence on the line doesn't change the defensive assignments at all and makar/toews still shuts it down if point is there or not. They had zero problem shutting down much better lines than the point line.
Honestly, I agree. Leafs are my bandwagon backup. If you fuck this up, beat us, and lose to the Bs you're dead to me though.
I know the Leafs haven't won for 56 years, but don't forget the Habs haven't won for 30 years.   Neither team is the Yankees because neither team wins.
I'm talking the hype around them, the media attention, the ubiquitous merchandise nationwide. The big contract, big names they always have in droves. The fact they don't win isn't a comparison point, just a fun side effect
I'm saying it's a what if, I don't know who would've won if both teams were healthy, but I think with Point we would've gotten a game 7.  I think saying that having Point would've made no difference to the series is just false
I mean the Yankees have only won once in the last 22 years so it’s not that far off
Fuck it’s been 30 years.
I think your opinion is very much clouded by recent history and those are mostly players we drafted as has already been pointed out. When I started watching this team in 2012 our star players were Phil Kessel and JVR. I loved them personally but even at their prime they were never anywhere as good as the stars we have today. We used to struggle to sign big free agents despite all we could offer on the side, it's only possible now because of the core that we drafted. No one really wanted to put up with the media to be on our shit team before we drafted Matthews and started our yearly first round exit tradition instead of our never make the playoffs tradition.  Not saying this is just because of Matthews if anyone takes it that way, I mean specifically that his rookie season was the season where this team turned things around. It was much more than just him.  Even then, it wasn't immediate. We were allowed to speak with Stamkos in 2016 before he went UFA and he decided to stay in Tampa because this team still had not proven enough to convince him to sign here. And he certainly made the right choice, looking at what Tampa has done since then.
Cool never said that.. said they still wouldn't have won. OP said they would have won. We had just finished completely shutting down McDavid and the oilers. It wasn't gonna change the outcome having to shut down Point.
True, but if you do a straight comparison, the Yankees have won 6 times in the last 30 years.
It's like we all did nothing!
Fun wild card race this year. Flames and jets has been interesting too. May go down to the final game to decide for all 5 teams.
Wrong. The Senators were contenders. Until they didn't pick up 2 points.
2-0-1 in the last 3 gets us in. If the pens drop a game in reg then 1-1-1 gets us in
https://youtu.be/tOugNisFgVo
Well we eliminated Ottawa. For whatever that counts for
The utter disrespect to Juuse Saros
Yeah, after having 6 spots in the East locked up since like December, it's nice to see some action for the WC spots.
The Senators were not contending for a playoff spot going into tonight.
Just had the exact same conversation with a family member last night regarding the panthers and islanders and how easy the pens schedule is compared to yinz haha
Very cool
And Detroit.
We are all winners on this blessed day
I guess you can throw Detroit in there too.
I think he gets them in.
They have been playing behind the 8 ball all year. When they’re good, they are good but very streaky. They even gave me concern for a bit.
Sure they were. They hadn't been eliminated.
Not cool actually. It's the one team the Leafs beat in the playoffs
Thats like saying Columbus was still in the playoff race after the all-star break because they were not mathematically eliminated yet.
Penguins aswell oddly enough, but tbf small and not recent sample
No it ain't
Before the games that night, the Senators max points was 89, and even if they won out, they still need some combination of the follow to get that last WC spot.  To catch the Panthers the Panthers could only get 1 point in their remaining 4 games. They cannot catch them in the tiebreaker.  To catch the Islanders the Islanders couldonly get 1 point in their remaining 4 games OR The Islanders get 2 points in their remaining 4 games IF the Senators win out in regulation and the Islanders do not win a game in Regulation.  To catch the Penguins the Penguins couldonly get 2 points in their final 4 games OR the Penguins get 3 points and Ottawa wins 1 more game in regulation than the Penguins do in those final 4 games.  To catch the Sabres the Sabres could only get 7 points in their final 6 games OR the Sabres get 8 points if the Sabres don't win in regulation two more games in Regulation than the Senators do.  They stood no chance to leap 3 of those 4 teams for the WC2 spot with how few games were left.
Sure they did
