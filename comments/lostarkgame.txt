The AH limit shouldn't even include relic too, or anything at that.
I would be happy too if they remove the limit on relic and ancient
You are someone who bought the early boxes right? If so I think in one of them you could get royal crystals which says ' free crystals'. So if you hover over your royal crystal it will say something like 'free royal crystals X'.  &#x200B;  I have 30 of those and you can't see them in currency exchange because you can't sell those for gold.
If I remember correctly, theres "free" royal crystals and paid ones and you can only use paid ones in the currency exchange. Hover over the royal crystals in the shop tab to see how many are "free". You probably have the free ones from founders packs or something.

Do we ever get a pop-up for the global version?
Wouldn't it be unreasonable to expect something from AGS? :-(
We can't even get an in game pop-up for the LOA on
congrats on your stone this stone was so close to being a shitty 9/7 and turned into a godly 10/6
Curious will you run Adrenaline 3?
HM2 is great for ignitor sorc...gg and fu
Why would it be shit as 9/7 if 10/6 is godly?
AOA is the best lvl 2 engraving there is when capped out.
Of course they will, it's igniter, it doesn't cap crit anyway, so adrenaline 3 is still really solid.
AoA at level 2 is trash compared to HM 2
Because you can do hit master 2, but all-out attack 2 is extremely bad.
Ah yes there's actually no better engraving than that
If they run hallucination it is very easy to cap crit with adrenaline
other way around.  AOA is only good due to the faster cast rate, which allow double doomsday. The damage increase on it is a net dps loss compared to just the rest. Level 2 is high enough to still allow double doomsday with ease while barely decreasing your dmg. Increase the damage of everything else by 8% is worth the 2% dps loss on the big 3.
Want me to dm you a link to Loot Heros? They're an NA E learning party disc that im currently in! Everyone's super chill there too 😎   I am considering signing up to be a teacher there too, and even found a inferno valtan group there too. It's really got everything u need. Looking for an argos run? They gotcha. Need guardian raids? Someone's gonna want to.
I suggest joining multiple discords that host learning parties and not just Loot Heroes. It doesn't hurt to have more options since signups usually fill up very quickly on all learning discords.  Esp with next week being Brel HM, with teachers now progging themselves with less time for teaching.  Promise also hosts some learning parties with very good teachers. You'll find their invite on the lost ark discord guild/static recruit sections.
If you were N.A. west I’d take you along :(
Vouching for Loot Hero.
Yes please that would be awesome! I appreciate it :D
Would love a link also!
Could I get the link as well? :)
I sent ya the link! You're very welcome, and I hope to see you around someday! Hehe
this is the funniest thing i’ve seen posted in awhile
lmao the chat
LMFAO
wtf people laughing it out instead of being madge what game is this
The game killed my guild.
Summer content downtime after vykas
unironically rmt bans
Guild's still around but mostly occupied by a handful of people and their 5-10 alts each. Probably 30~ unique Steam accounts in the guild and I'd say about 20 of them have quit.  Most of my guild though already played FF14, which (much like every other MMO I imagine?) has become a game where guilds are house hubs and a glorified friend list rather than social hubs with activities. All chatting is done on discord, and that's basically how LA started rather than became.  In terms of just general quit cycles, I'd say it was three big waves.  1. A couple months after launch, like all MMO launches and expansions, a huge quit wave as people realized this wasn't their new lifer MMO. That and Argos was pretty hard to get to when it launched which created an artificial divide in those who pushed and those who hadn't.  2. Slightly before Clown launch, massive lull in content compared to the first 5~ months of the game, the game was settling in to its formula of just doing your legion chores every week and waiting on enough bound mats to do 1-2 hones a week. Some people I knew who were very excited the first part of the year just didn't take to the model and found it underwhelming.  3. Shortly after Brel hit. There was some form of "release" as people finally completed the coveted Brelshaza raid, the raid people joined the game to do off of the Saintone vid, the big space opera booby lady raid. People who'd been prepping for a year, they did it and just felt "done." All that really awaited them after was, what it is, the formula, though I do admit the Brel soft reset is really nice while it lasts in terms of the feeling of progression. I know some who quit and some who have just mentally really checked out of the game and still play (much less than before).
Mainly what you just said. Just need to join one of the biggest guilds on the server to have all active players.
Still alive and doing weeklies with them since Vykas release. Some people took breaks but some joined so still active
Drama in GvG
Dragonflight
Well we lost our guild lead last summer when he rage quit after some bad hones and passed lead to an officer without saying anything. Slowly we lost our officers to burn out and we weren't really recruiting anymore. A lot of our more active members "quit" for bigger GvG guilds.  That being said I've joined half a dozen guilds since and our "dead" guild is still the most active guild I've been in since the game came out. It's the only guild I can ping for a run and get multiple people to come at any time of the week. It's a guild that types thousands of messages a day in discord. My "alive" guilds have dead AF discords and nobody ever seems to want to run together. It's kinda sad, really. My guild is amazing and we're finally starting to revitalize (I think) but none of the active guilds I've been in feel very alive.
Egirls
My guild's fine, ~50 active unique players (72 characters in main guild, three active wholly-owned alt guilds and 2 semi-owned affiliate alt guilds), ~20 of which never miss guild v guild activities  I think dead servers are actually better at fostering active guilds because there's no one else to talk to.
Mostly burn out and general loss of interest. We then merged with a bigger and more active guild.
Clown made all our statics that were made since Valtan to break, and eventually everyone went separate ways and there's only a few people on the guild compared to before where we had more than 7 statics even with subs in case people didn't make it.
Clown at itemlevel and drama killed mine...
Class release killed most of mine as we played on RU before and most of our classes weren’t released.   Also we had to split between EU and NA :( and well the long wait for raids didn’t help.  But if i really needed to single one thing it is the poor management of global release: bots, bugs the likes of which we have never seen before, close to no communication with players, to be honest RU was better in almost every way
Grind killed everybody except guild leader. I started coming back, and now the guild leader hasn't been on since 1st week after the artist released. Something tells me he might of been banned from rmt. Now it's only me in the guild with my alts.
Bussing  Half bus everything  The other half is slowly dwindling
Valtan release 💀
My guild is still active but I feel like we lost a lot of players on clown release, most of the groups we planned didn't pass g2 so I don't even want to talk about G3 and on the following weeks ppl stick with the group they cleared with first week and most others left the game. Since Brel we got some new ppl and I think the guild is now in a good state again
My guild is still alive though.
Bussing.  Why would you run normal raids if you can bus for twice the profit? Statics... what statics? Who wants to form statics everyone has bussing to finish there's no characters for regular runs.  This is how all 3 guilds I have been part of died.  "Just teach everyone how to bus and run busses together" Most people don't actually want to waste that much time on this game, busses are far too tedious/far too long to set up and actually get rolling. Also not everyone has the confidence or the roster to bus and in addition if you fuck up busses you are costing people refunds/time/reputation and things can get.... drama filled pretty quick.  Bussing really ruins all the community aspects of this game \*Shrugs\* It is what it is though.
You know... Rather than doing something about bots... You screw over your player base instead... Which cause ripple effect and friends groups are missing people for their weekly raid and people stop playing because their friends are banned. Then farmers start selling through auction house because of rmt mail ban and causes the economy to get wrecked.   Some guy posted this would happen in July 2022 when they started banning rmt, it happened exactly as he said it would.
You mean screw over the people rmt’ing?  Both bots AND the people buying are at fault. Let’s not extend condolences to the rmt’ers who can’t show up for weeklies cause they got banned. Weird take honestly.
Good riddance imo. Not gonna pretend the people who benefit from RMT'ing friends are as bad as the RMTers themselves, but I definitely don't care that AGS is making it impossible for them to continue to do so. Fuck anyone who buys botted gold.
I have 0 sympathy for rmters who get banned. They should've just played normally if they didn't wanna screw over their friends. 0 sympathy for the guildmates of rmters either.   Our guild kicks anyone who rmts or buses bots. 99% of them are dicks anyway.
Paladin is a support, berserker is a dps
If you have in mind the idea of a paladin similar to Diablo or WoW, forget about It, in this game, for the end game content, paladin is only viable as a support.
Paladin deals literally 1% the damage of a Zerker because of how supports work in this game.  That said, I’d you like story, Paladin is really thematic and can make moments more dramatic with the slower kill speed.  Otherwise, Zerk is probably better as your main
waiting clown release
Do you want a sword or a bigger sword?
I can build a dps paladin
Everyone can make a dps paladin, but just because you can, doesn't mean you should
bruh u couldve just saved them as lopang... always need that silver...
A lot of people would tell you that was a mistake but honestly, if playing your main is the most fun and you don't want to play a weaker versions of your main it's totally ok. The amount of homework you have to do for gold is insane plus dailies. I got 8 characters, 2 loopangs and the main 6, 3 of them are supports and with the current situation, is imposible to do any raids with them, people prefer a 1460 than a 1520. Still is great for me dropping 3 characters, don't feel pressure to do anything and currently sitting at the same 80m silver at 1560. The other 2 is a gunlancer that i keep just because doing chaos on him is actually fun and just funnel to my main, the other is a scrapper that... I don't know what I'm going to do with it but is there and she gets gold easy so probably gonna be there for while slayer is released.
Its only a "mistake" in the sense that the real issue is something that isn't Lost Ark related.  Logically there isn't any benefit to deleting them. There should be no reason that you cant have the 1460 around and only play 1 or 2 characters & ignore the ones you want. Some days will come around and you may want to do just a little bit more on Lost Ark on that week, the option being there is always nice.  But if you can't control yourself like that/improve it and its either delete them or only FOMO then I guess, sure. But honestly I'd take that as a moment to self reflect because stuff like this is going to affect you everywhere in life and your going to deal with it in plenty of places outside of this game. It really isn't a Lost Ark issue, Lost Ark just brings the issue to the forefront for people who have it.
what fomo? you're already 1570 lmao
No need to force yourself to do something if it isn't fun, so good move for you OP.
ok...
I deleted a few 1460's myself because they weren't fun at all to play and I wasn't going to invest further into them. Now my roster is almost complete and I like all my characters.   Don't let others tell you it was a mistake. With just two characters you'll have more than enough Silver for everything you need.
i think your mistake is keep classes you dont actually like  &#x200B;  im main sorc, i didnt want any other classes so i just made more sorc   when one class i like was relesed i delete a sorc     now my 6 roster is    sorc (reflux) 1555   arcana (empress) 1540   summoner (overflow) 1540   bard 1530   sorc (igniter) 1530   summoner (master) 1525     i also have an ayaya and a shadowhunter (demonic) that i play ocasionally, and a machinist that do lopang and chaos sometimes and gonna get deleted once aromancer is in the game
Lmao cya. I don’t play this game anymore since last year but even I know not to delete the time and effort I wasted into this time sink.
Big balls OP
I only PvP, I used to try to keep up with PvE contents but realized that it was sucking the fun out of me.      Now I exclusively do PvP and I enjoy this game much more - I hope you feel that way as well. Ggs.
Ballsy but I get why you did it. Enjoy the freedom.
This is how I play the game:  >I have no interest in week 1 clear or whatever and I don't lose anything if I take my sweet time. People who did them early will eventually wait for the rest, who are indeed the majority of LA player base.  It's understandable that some want the latest content done asap, but assuming most of the players would do the same is simply being delusional.
OP I can relate in some regard.  For what it's worth I played from launch 2022 until July 2022 and at the time was roster ~150, most horizontal completed, running 6 t3 alts with a 1475 artillerist before vykas even dropped.  Ended up getting extremely burnt out, guild died, and my 10+ friends all quit. I also was waiting to main swap to Scouter and it getting delayed was the tipping point.  I came back to the game March 2023, and prepped for the Artist patch. I used everything I had stashed + events to push my new main (now 1550). I kept a new rule to stop playing my army of alts almost entirely.  I essentially stick to 1 main (scouter) and 1 "main alt" (arty) and call it a day. Never been happier!
Out of sight out of mind. Having them there might force him to go back to playing them even though he doesn’t want to. Silver is an issue for most players because they have 6 characters they’re trying to hone constantly.   One character alone is fine and with his ilvl it’s more difficult to run out of silver because your honing chances are lower so you aren’t constantly feeding exp to hone the next piece. If anything he’ll run out of leapstones/guardian stones before he runs out of silver because he has no brel characters to feed his main.
He can always ask customer support to restore them, the number of characters that can be restored is limited but i cant remind it top of my head.
I think 80m silver is enough for my main. People are low on silver because they spend it to gear up their high ilevel alts mainly. Would I really need more if I'm only focused on literally 1 character?
If you play 2 characters at most, the only way of running out of Silver is if you throw it away on purpose. I never ran into Silver problems until I was on my 4th character. Always had 30m+
I understand your point. However, I don't see myself needing or wanting to play on those alts anymore. I can get by without them I'm sure. I'm regaining control by limiting the amount of time on the game so i can invest more time on other priorities in life while still enjoying less hours that I've set for myself on Lost Ark. I could keep my alts around sure, but what use is there with them when I have no desire to play them ever? That's why I made the personal choice to declutter.
thats what im saying, OP needs some self control. he couldve just kept his alts and not play on them but he decided to (maybe)delete them to make a post on reddit. Kinda weird if u ask me. Idk how this post has upvotes tbh
1570 shouldn't take that long to achieve when you are spending 90% of your resources on your main rather than high ilevel alts. My alts are malnourished slaves while my main eats all the food.
Self control is better, He made an idiotic move but it's his account he can do what he wants. Maybe Not idiotic but definitely unreasonable. My account is way more decked out than His And if I don't feel like playing I just don't play. Having more character that doesn't entice me to do something that I don't want to do.
If you were in an unhappy relationship, wouldn't you want to leave? Or would you feel obligated to stay because you've invested so much time and effort into somebody you no longer love?
But you continue to waste your time into a subreddit for a game you don't play. Just goes to show how valuable or should I say not valuable your time is.
If I may ask, why are you still here on this subreddit if you've already quit and don't like this game and think it was a waste of your time and effort?
Those motherfuckers can't even restore items, don't expect them to restore chars
yea, you actually get so much silver it's crazy.  you only really run out if you are mass honing multiple characters.  like to hone the brel weapon from +20 to +25 in average scenario is just a little less than 30 million. which already own, but I bet you don't have the 6 million honor shards required.
No, you'll be more than fine. I never ran into Silver issues until I was well into my 4th character. People saying "but lopang slaves op???" are completely missing the point of your thread.
OP is so strong willed, they did what none of us could ever dream of doing /s
I mean they can do both, but it may be up to where your ticket lands.   As someone that has worked in customer support for an isp you were SOL if your account needed anything out of the common since my tools in my callcenter (mexico) and the philipines was only T1. Only the cs in the us (T1 & T2) had the appropriate tools, but since it was too expensive to have them work 24/7 they only worked business hours lol.
Just in case anyone wants the context: Me and my static did two clown runs. On our first clear, I got my first deathless clown and the statue that comes with it. On our second clear, well... this happened.  To sum it up, the Scrapper was trying to greed onto an HP pot while DPS'ing to phase Kakul through to bingo phase, but barely died before he could phase. Our Wardancer died to hammers while trying to place bombs that came from the far side of their screen, and our Gunlancer died at some point around 50-40 HP bars.  I had to go solo Bard gaming and get every single bingo because we already used Inanna on a previous bingo, so I had no sidereal gauge going into it and I couldn't fail any of the bingos. In the end, I survived for 297 seconds by myself, got turned into a clown at least ten times, and cleared the entire bingo board as my last and final bingo to finish the raid, and that was when I took this screenshot.  Should've probably recorded it, but I didn't know this raid would be that big of a banger since I was on a Bard.
This is so much fun! HUEHUHEUHUEHUEHUEHUEHUE
That is how I clear clown first week
Similar vein: I love how when you finish Vykas. Typically everybody's just pooped everywhere so the entire floor is just the pink lusty poop with a big "Gate cleared" on top like we hadn't just made a horrible mess everywhere
For my main, I always do the 3 Una dailies (2 Feiton and 1 Mokoko Night Market) for bound leapstones and daily or rested Chaos Dungeons (depends how I feel). I always do Guardian Raids rested and then sell the leapstones for gold.   For alts, since honing to 1445 doesn't cost gold, I'd work on those two you already have and try to get them to 1445 for Valtan HM and Vykas NM gold. This will help your main gear up for Clown and Brelshaza. I don't know your situation but I've never been gated by silver pre-Brel so I would actually swap them to leapstone dailies to help them push faster.
No real reason to not have a roster of 6 characters or even more if that's what you enjoy. Even if they sit on full rested and you just run done lopang and weekly raids on them, you're getting something out of it. Progressing your roster and getting 6 gold earners is how you can attempt to close the gap but realistically it's not going to happen. You can get to the point where your main can do content on release, though.
Never MM abyss dungeon unless you doing solo carry card runs and don’t minds carrying bots. Do PF. MM is garbage in this game. That’s why PF is the normal way of grouping up in this game. I get causal think MM is the easy/lazy way to group up when you have no one to play with because of other games but MM simply don’t work for this type of game.
Sadly this is what new players have to experience.  However you can try to join card farming teams and see if anyone wants to give you a free ride, or you can make a lobby requesting the help from the community.  Other options are discord and an in game guild.
Congratulations on spotting bots in the wild for the first time.
Join free carry no bid.  All the rats que up now expecting a carry.
Im curious, are they able to kill the boss without help ? What about the 8/6/4 star mech for the other dungeon, can they do that ?  (i play with a static, i rarely see bots in Aira / Oreha, never played with 3 bots)
Never matchmake anything outside of basic content like chaos/guardians-ish/cube/boss rush
There's nothing wrong returning/new players sharing their experience just like what "old" players have been doing on a daily basis.   This post is as normal as the following:  >I cut a x/y stone   >   >I tapped my +20 weapon with/without hitting a pity   >   >I improved my weapon quality to 100 on my alt/support   >   >I failed to improve my weapon quality on my main
It’s more so just that when I left this was a huge issue. Now I come back after what feels like forever and it feels worse than before. 🤷🏻‍♂️
I ran a few on my other alts where there were only 1-2 bots in there. They can not do mechanics and most all of them are Reflux sorcs. They are good for like 1, maybe 2 bars of damage before they die just more or less standing still.
It's way better than before at least on my server, sure there are still bots but they aren't as bad now.
Queuing into these two dungeons are just a gigantic waste of time... insta disband happens like 99% of the time even if they are all real people I swear lol.
the bots are actually well less than before, and you can tell by the prices of gold on bot sites, as well as the steam player charts.  prices on G2G range a bit, but it's like 100k gold for 33 dollars. at the bots all time high it was 100k gold for 10 dollars.  bots are way down.  Plus everything has gone way down in prices (books, jewelries, etc) due to less gold being in circulation.
ah ok .. i thought they were so advanced that they can do mechs. That means they need us to carry them.   which also means if im with my static, and one of them comes in, we should just restart or something ... man i wish we could kick bots out, instead of disbanding.
I just started playing lost ark 6 months ago, and I learned all the mechs by myself. I started playing support as I was told that it was easy to find parties for raids and I felt that it was true. However, with the artist release, I find it 1) extremely hard to find a party without 2 supports inside already and 2) not getting kicked/banned for being low roster.
Brel hard 1-2 and above should be still needing supp (hard to make it to 1540)... Also after free engravings goes away in June, a lot of 1490-1500 artists will become lopang employees
Once hard mode is out, you’ll have it easy again.
My personal opinion is that this going to be for a while. Currently i have 3 support 4x3 (you don't need drops of ether if none picks it up) and I can't get into any raids, 99% of them are 2 supports parties looking for DPS. You could snipe for some but it can take hours for a vykas and clown. The only content i see you could do is brel hard but in my case, why would I hone a character to 1560 to do 1 raid if I can't get into valtan, vykas and clown? That's a huge investment that is not going to give any return. Even after the free engravings end, there will be plenty of supp for the main gold earning raids,gearing them is pretty cheap. I just dropped all 3 and enjoying the game more by playing less characters.
Agreed, I went from playing almost everyday to now once a week. I run a 4 Main Sup roster 1540 Bard, 1520 Bard, 1520 Paly, 1510 artist, 1530 GL and 1530 GS. With how long it takes to get into groups now, i just can't be bothered playing since my time is limited with work and family.
That's my life right now with 3 support gold earners. My bard main has a static for brel but my paladin who is 1506 and my ayaya at 1500 is having the hardest time. Get declined all the time, or get into the party and then get kicked after awhile for a higher level support (which never happened with my dps), or join a lobby already with a support then we wait for a long time for no dps to show up then the other support dips.   Like I knew it was rough since I have 3 dps to get into a party but it's worse for supports. While parties have have 6 slots for dps, there are only 2 slots for supports.  Once Brel Hard it might get a better. Kinda wish I had more dps alts at brel.
I swap my main soulfist for pali and mage for bard and after spending 5x3 lvl 7 gems well I'm back were I started! I know is temporary support will rise again but hope we never see the support 3x3 rainbow stats meta ever again
Brel HM is going to be a struggle not many people are pushing their sup characters to gates 3-6.  honestly its what happens when supports basically work with 3 engravings as core and a 1460 sup with full set does 90% of what a 1560 sup do which in raiding is shield, attack buff, ulti and sometimes actually playing right.   But the amount of people still taking mediocre support builds with full legendaries (not even perfect quality), no gems, no cards and wrong stats doesn’t help either.
Is it hard to get into a group or is it hard to get into juiced groups? Neither of my supports have any problem getting into near-ilvl parties, like at all. If I’m fishing for a carry, I have to apply right when a party starts up.
When engraving feature leaves so will supports
there's a lot of alt supports in lower raids now, and nobody really cares what ilvl or gear support has     i don't think it'll get easier until we get 3 higher gold earning raids. brel hm, akkan, voldike.      copium but maybe they'll change elgacia to gold earning, i think it's plausible
If you were a kind person to your static and didn't act like royalty they might help you out.  I always wait and save 1 or 2 strong dps to help my support friend that has been with us since vykas <3
The main cause of the influx of supports is artist release coinciding with an express event that gives engraving support. Once express event ends, I imagine plenty of people will drop their new support alts since they will need to actually spend to gear them. Brel HM should still have support shortage as it use to be.
Just make your own group bro :)
best thing happened to the game , no more jacky cheapo sup kicking people below 1500 for vykas , clown is more accessible below 1490 now because FOMO forced those support have to take any dps they found ( that explain tons of G2-3 jailge last week lol )  Btw if you actually invest in your support , you're still good to go
It’s still easy. Just make a party with a stupid name and juicers come swarming. My favorite is “Juicers get (insert random flavor) Capri-sun/ Kool-Aid”
This is why you should make a mate who's willing to wait for each other. For latest contents, DPS main without static will struggle to get into a group. Support main will struggle for some lower contents that has enough supports. Help him when he needs you, and make him help you when you need him.
It’ll go back for higher content, not for lower content though.  And I’m already 1581 on my main Paladin, I don’t struggle at all for groups really
it’s still easy just make the group
omg im so glad this has happened thank god
If you want to give yourself a chance of getting into groups as support now, make sure you're running You Have A Plan card set if you still haven't finished Lostwind Cliff. Most people I know will now instantly reject a support running HP cards or, God forbid, defense and potion effectiveness card set.
Kinda off topic - but I’m just curious: how do you enjoy pally / bard / artist running Brel? I’m still deciding which support to push 🙂 thanks
When aeromancer releases it'll even itself back out with a huge surplus of dps.
1500+ still have about the same rate, 1520 almost the same if not the same  1540+ is going to be the same as usual, supp mains and dps main only     in my clan we burn 3-4 supps per run usually xD
im 99% sure your 1560 paly will get into groups no issues. not many are that high, so you'll be fine for brel hard.  if you don't run everything with static then run your lower ones with static and pub your 1560
Maybe when Aero releases, you will go back to your normal life?
- open your own group - wait 5-10 minutes and the group is full - start the raid - have fun  thats me with 3 supports in my goldroster the last weeks since artist release  i will never understand the people which want to jump instand into the raid, just be patient and wait longer than 2 minutes
Wait it out for aero release, everything will be fine then for supps
Might be a while, but next two classes coming out are DPS. If people don’t bench their Artist, still a solid chance they bench **a** support for the new DPS flavor. 🙂👍
Yes when they release slayer or aeromancer things will go back to normal if they release them with a power pass, hyper express and big event.  I made an artist just to have one support in my roster and after 3 weeks i realized that it was horrible to get into parties. Even tho i have lostwind 30 its literally insane. But statistically talking if a party has 2 supports and 6 dps it makes sense that its more difficult to find party for a support if everybody has at least 1 support
Why will the free engravings going away make 1490 artists become lopangs though? 4x3 is really cheap 75 pheons plus maybe 10k gold, and you can just always have 4x3 on support, no need to 5x3. And at 1490 it’s already past the point where it’ll earn back the gold, I would think investing to 1490 means it’s there to be a permanent gold earner
Good points  I'm not too worried Bout my brel hard runs, more annoyed with finding my other weeklies to complete.  But you.are probably right, come June it will become easier again.
Not in vykas/clown. I've made a dps set for vykas and usually do damage comparable to 1500 dps at 1560.
You are special for any of those problem to affect you but for aloy of us support main it does take longer to join because we have no freaking opportunity to apply when they already had 2
This^  Clown specifically is a problem with the 1490 artist
It can feel challenging to get into any groups because it seems like every group already has two supports, but that's not to say it's impossible or difficult.
Its insanely cheap to gear a full swift support 4x3.  Purple class book  Purple HA book  Expert/awakening rock, just a 5/5 will do, who cares.  2 argos with +3 class  Fill up HA/Expert/Awakening with 3 last accessories.  For Pally, do for example VPH instead of HA   Lvl5 gems is 3 weeks max SSF even if this is your only and first character doing weekend events and boss rushes.   You can basically do this 40 times for the cost of gearing a single surge blade.
They good peeps always looking to help, just an off week for timing.
Lies even my 1540+ 1750 swift 5x3 bards gets denied on. VALTAN
Lol, no. I got denied on my 5x3 Pally in favor of ilvl cheapo Bard with leg accessories only. This will never happen for dps.
Dps still gets gatekept lmao
Happened what? Now we are waiting for 6ppl instead of 2? Ye, thats better.
Paly is more relaxed and gives better buffs (according to mvp screen), also has better stagger since the recent patch. G5 counter is a breeze with him as well. Bard has more skills to defend against getting knocked down or off the platform in g4-6. Artist I'm still getting used to.
Exactly, people lack critical thinking skills. 1490 costs over 100K gold in honing costs when you include fusion materials. Nobody invests that much gold to abandon the character because they need a shitty 1700 swift 4×3 setup to continue playing it. The 1445-1475 Ayayas might get abandoned, but the people at Brel either enjoy the class or are using her as a gold earner. You get over 10K per week, her set could be bought for that much.  Same place that mass downvoted anyone who said that Artist would help with support shortages, can barely see past the end of their noses.
> and you can just always have 4x3 on support, no need to 5x3  Tell that to my bard and pala, got denied all day last week to the point i just dropped them from my gold roster this week. I didnt enjoy them to begin with so im ok, but this is no longer the case.
From what I saw on what I’d need for my hyper expressed pally, it’s more like 10k gold per acc to hit 4x3.  Things with expert/awakening/VPH are not cheap
Don’t forget Aero & Slayer later in the year as well. Come July or August (my guess) for either and it’ll be back to support shortage like mad.
Sorta, a solo DPS who's over geared can just join into any party that's +1 or +2 DPS… which is a ton of parties.
I recommend bard more fun than paladin confirmed by all Paladins
And yet NAE definitely is seeing dps shortages now - maybe not even shortages but something changed in the last couple weeks.  I see so many groups in PF for Brel with two sups slowly filling on dps now.  Something definitely happened with artist release that shifted the scales.  I don’t see that changing just because free engravings go away.  Now more than ever is it cheap as hell to build just about any toon as you need it.  Even moreso as a crit or swift type build.  Very few spec builds are even still pricey anymore - most people have their 5x3 so it seems everything has taken a dive in price/value.  Even class engraving books are cheaper than ever.  Outside the pheon costs, if you wanted to build a new character now is the time - before we cross into ancient gear and see obscene week 1 prices again.  For a lot of people relic accs will still be workable for the foreseeable future until some time has passed and ancient accessories gear becomes more affordable also
Its ok this wk I decided to make my 2nd support a gold earner instead of this dps (because support is more lazy), and I regretted it because even though its a 1520 support, it just had no lobbies to join. The lobbies I did join for vykas and clown were kind of jail, and it took so long in partyfinder just to be accepted. I don’t think it was gatekept, its just no space haha
Try to set up an excel sheet maybe to plan your 4x3, it might help find the cheapest combo. You can also wait to make a 4x3 since you got until that june/july (I forget). It could be expensive since its 3 weeks in since artist was released.
over geared dps has always had it easy in valtan/vykas. What's good now is that 1465s can now easily get in vykas again.
I think part of the equation that people forgot...people with 6  in main roster that added an artist likely gave up something else. Sure a few gave up a support for a support, but I bet most gave up a DPS for a support. So, not only was a support added, but a DPS was removed.
Yeah same experience even tho my 2 supps are 1520 there is just not enough parties lol.
Always been Zerk Sorc Arti since launch.  Rarely they bot the new char to farm the books. Other day I caught glimpse of botters bussing 7 1445 botted Artists. Eventually one of those will drop books and some Full Bloom accs.
it’s always been zerker sorc wdym
Mostly sorc and zerker was always second. Felt like zerker was a lot more popular during the initial release but sorc was always #1
I haven't seen a Zerker bot in ages all I see is Sorc
I only saw them use Sorc not Zerk this is the first time I see them on zerk
must be a region thing
He equipped the bikini and the cat ears
U can get the ears from stronghold Pet Shop
how do i get the bikini
Auction house. It was sold in the cash shop last summer and now you can get it from other players in the Auction House. It most likely won't come back to the cash shop as we'll probably get new swimwear this summer.
oh thanks for this info.
For the high end, the chart made by Portia last year is relatively comparable to our version.  https://imgur.com/iLOJH7A   Obviously you should be maxing your tripods if you haven't done so yet. Weapon quality is worth paid tapping until around 80, free tapping until around 90 for most people, then starts to get passed by options on that chart. Lastly, value of gems varies greatly per class, any classes that have a high % of damage locked up in less than 4 skills should be getting better gems sooner.
Stats and tripods should be top of the list. Even before engravings if you're being cost efficient.   Assuming you have a decently geared character already,  Let's set a starting point.   4x3 legendary gear Level 5 gems Random tripods    First thing you should work on is tripods.  Enable tracking for you 18 top ones, and start using everything you can from chaos to get everything above level 1. Getting these to level 5 should ve your top priority, as it provides one of the highest damage boost, but won't help shield against gatekeeping.   Stats are next, and some say together with engravings.   Stats > engravings  But because you need new accessories to improve Stats, do it at the same time.   Remember 4x3 high quality > 5x3 low/medium quality.   A level 20 weapon is way down on the list of priorities if you're going bang for the buck. Ahead really only of level 10 gems, which is an extreme luxury. You really should be investing in getting gems to 7 before trying to go for a 20 weapon. People only spend on it for glow, not because it's cost efficient.  Weapon quality is also way down on the list, get it to 80+ if you can, otherwise it should slot in, cost wise before gems and before +20.
lvl 10 gems have huuuuge diminishing return...what that means is that they are not worth it for 99% of the players.  Lvl 10 gems are whale traps or flex only.  What you can do is getting Brel 20 weapon, purple quality if anything and abuse party synergy.
ilvl>quality>gems>engravings+accessories>bracelet  Everything is “within reason.” A 1590 with 0 quality is dumb, but a 1500 with all 100 quality is stupid. Just focus on ilvl a tad more than quality in this example    Tripods you should just always be doing, but obviously they help a good chunk
Per your gold it's something like:  Bound mat (Shards, Leapstones) honing up to 1460 > level 5 gems > Tripods > Bound mat honing up to 1560 > 5X3 > level 7 gems > high (80+) weapon quality honing > level 10 damage gems on jobs with 60% damage source > unbound honing up to 15XX > level 9 damage gems > Mari's Shop for cards > level 10 damage gems for jobs with most skills in the 15-20% total damage range each  Of course, all things in moderation. Most would recommend to work on your 5X3 before going to 1490 so you can actually enter Brelshaza parties and good Clown parties. You can technically skimp on tripods as long as you tag them and constantly attempt to level 5 them over time, which is something you can't really do with any other system cheaply besides gems over a long time (and even then that's not a money save, gems are essentially convertible cash with barely any tax so going self found with them is just delaying your own acquisition).  Also while weapon quality honing and tripods are efficient versus a lot of systems they're also gambling which can *feel* much worse since technically you can dump money into the void for nothing, unlike gems and 5X3. Still extremely efficient though.
Thank you for the chart link. I didn't see that before.
The biggest thing to remember about this chart is that honing is somewhat temporary but almost everything else is forever. So a lot of those long term investment power increases like level 10 gems and bracelets/stones are actually far more efficient than honing in the long run. Every time we get a new tier of gear it is a soft reset on honing cost and something like a 25 weapon was a lot of "wasted" materials.
Thanks
Interesting, is 4x3 high quality really better than 5x3 low quality?
Agree with the overall sentiment, but if people play certain classes the investment is definitely worth e.g. either DB build, barrage Arti, either transformation build all get a huge chunk of damage with one level 10 gem.   I play a lot of swiftness/uptime classes e.g. AS machinist, PS shadowhunter, so to get the same damage increase I would likely need 2-4 level 10 gems as the above classes. Gunslinger is atrocious with 7 damage gems...   Don't know about middle classes that have different proportions of DPS like sorc/summoner and how much value a doomsday/ancient summon gem provides.   Quality IMHO can be a larger gold sink than gems if you are aiming for purple. I had insane with quality upgrades and have all 4 DPS on my gold earning roster > 93. I have buddies that have spent exponentially more good on a single character with a blue weapon than I did on my account.
the "resets" are extremely soft and barely worth mentioning when it comes to honing.  As it is right now, you are free to hone to 1580 without any issue since it is the entry point of the next tier of gear.
Yes.   [https://youtu.be/Tr6VozPsLIw](https://youtu.be/Tr6VozPsLIw)
Most of the time yeah. But 5x3 is still better for getting in groups themselves even with low quality
Depending on the class, easily.
Not always. It's just dmg inc from stat diff vs another engraving. This changes with different classes, some have thresholds that need to meet. It's also how high the quality difference is if you're comparison 0quality to 100 quality sure but somewhere in between another engraving for 16-18% dmg increase will be better.   Edit: For example my EW DE Last Request: 5x3 0Quality no bracelet simulation: 22.75M 4x3 100Quality no bracelet: 20.914M   There would be some variance with the numbers but 5x3 0quality is definitely better than 4x3 100quality. Deadeye which is a spec class with no gauge mechanic. This would be different for classes with meter gain, or crit/swift focused builds or just a different spec multiplier.
I'd say PS SH gets a lot of value from lvl 10 gems too. Approximately 50% - 60% of your DPS consists of your 2 spenders (at least with full Swift, it may vary with other builds)           Personally I have a PS SH too, sitting at 1550. I'm planning to just give her 2 lvl 10 DMG gems for her spenders, and 9s for Thrust / Sharpened Cut and maybe Decimate.            But yeah otherwise you're right. Especially regarding quality because I think I spent well over 200k gold on my main alone for the weapon quality to only move from 60 to 68. Most of my alts haven't fared any better either.          Just going for the guaranteed non-gamble upgrade while still giving your weapon occasional quality taps is probably the better option.
yeah because people dont actually check gear like they should
Interested in CO Summoner but sound like 5x3 is still the better way to go
That's where the diminishing returns come in though, which is what I think the comment I responded to was mentioning.   1-2 damage gems for a lot of classes can boost half of your damage maybe a bit more, but to get that remaining damage you need more gems and it's a horrible investment for any normal player. (For most people 10s are just not a great investment in general)  PS is a good example, yes you get quite a bit from upgrading cutter and demolition ~49% according to the community guide, but to fill in the other 52% of the damage you need 4 more gems for thrust impact, sharpened cut, decimate, and slasher/rising fist. Slasher is about 8% with the other 3 almost dead even at 12-14%.   Surge DB gets 55% of its damage from surge according to the community guide. For PS to get a comparable increase assuming full 7s as a baseline you need approximately 2 level 10 gems and 2-3 level 9s.
Completly agree, my PS alt is decked just like that. For me the next thing is armor to 18-19 and the last thing is CD gems passively to 9
Stats are super important for CO as higher swift means better uptime on atk buffs. I think it's around 1750 and L9 gems that you get 100% uptime.
Yeah it does have diminishing returns compared to 1 gem classes but I definitely wouldn't call it "huge".        In comparison to other classes like Tai Scrapper and Reflux Sorc where the damage is fairly evenly spread for example, I definitely wouldn't suggest going for lvl 10s there until you have everything else covered.          2 and a half lvl 10 gems is still decently efficient in my books, at least well more so than trying to gamble your gold away on weapon quality lmao.
Diminishing returns in general man, look at the PS example.  Most people don't have 1.3 million gold sitting around
EW is played at lvl 1 and pistoleer is a meme class  Books dont fairly represent the class
Endgame Enhanced Weapon deadeyes have Grudge/KBW/CD as their engraving books because the optimal build for them is 4x3 Adre 2 Class 1.   Pistoleer on the other hand... In my 4.7k hours of playing LOA, I've only seen 4-5 Pistoleers. That's how rare and unpopular the class is, reflecting the book prices.
From the community guide:  "Generally, since the class is lowly populated, not many players know what Deadeyes do. Deadeye is sometimes lumped in with Gunslinger’s “floor POV,” or dead on the ground stereotype, often being referred to as Deadgeye. However, Deadeye has the potential to survive and do just as well as any other class."  I made a Deadeye with the last power pass and built him as Pistoleer since I'm going with a specific theme with the character and it's fun to play, it only feels bad with low crit chance but that gets fixed after getting 4 pieces of the relic set and has pretty good destruction and stagger as well.
Difference between EW at lvl1 and the 5x3 build is 3% according to the community guide so I went with that cheap option.  Paid about 300g a book though! Oh noes! ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)
Made one with the power pass that we got with scouter. Didn't really think much of it, I just made of because noone in our static had one, so I wanted to check how the class feels for myself.  Started with Pistoleer, it was pretty fun to play, but you could feel the lack of damage. Changed to EW and he became one of my favourites. Both builds were pretty cheap, I went for EW3 as it's the same crate as EW1 adre2, it's just a little bit less Atk power, and is way cheaper.  It's now my 2nd "Main Alt" and have the best Quality on armors and weapon (everything purple except chest which is blue) in my whole roster, even better than my main lol.  It's just not a popular class, as if someone wants to have a class that uses firearms most will choose Gunslinger over Deadeye. She has Booba (the most important perk ofc) and its waaaaaaaaay easier to deal damage - it's hitmaster class and not Entropy that needs to be sticking Shotgun in the ass all the time.
Well, EW is best run at lvl 1 so there isn't really much of a point in having it at x12.       And Pistoleer is.. yeah.
Wait for major buff/rework. But ya in term of popularity      Class pretty much dead. Rarely seen any deadeye in general. Maybe my ilvl too high, maybe there’s some in lower lvl as alts
Check DS SharpShiter
The recent buff was not bad. Ez class to play but very limited for engravings.
Deadgeye has always been an acquired taste
It's funny to me that for 2k gold you can max both class engravings
Buying Deadeye Class accessories is a pain in the ass. Not to mention buying and selling gems are also painful.
The pistoleer meme thing is a bit outdated, it's actually pretty good for how comfy and easy it is now.
With Grudge/KBW/CD and Adre 2 Class 1, what would be the 5th engraving?
EW deadeye is A-tier damage easily on top of having a perma crit synergy. There's no way theyre getting buffs lol.
It always felt comfy and easy to me, even the damaged wasn’t that bad since you’re a mid-range non-entropy class.  The damage buffs from recent update increased the damage some more.  The buff to Death Fire is tearing it up in Chaos Dungeons.
Ambush master
S tier effort to play for A tier damage is not a very good trade
It just needs a few quality of life changes tbh, how 1 being able to apply synergy with dexterous shot for 1
\#4 Inanna jumpscare, lmao.
Glad to see I’m not the only one doing the Artist portal trolling
How did #9 work? Did the striker take consecutive strike on his tiger kick?
The 6 (that I can see) Artillerists got me.
5 is relatable
What the fuck have you done.
Na he just space bar dashed back and countered  https://m.youtube.com/shorts/NCsjgzmWLag?feature=share
I just started about a week and a half ago. Currently playing at an easy pace and I'm level 25 or so. Super fun game playing as a paladin. Haven't really noticed any bots.
Is this what Copium overdose feels like?
I love the positivity of this post. Everyone always quick to post complaints, nice to see somebody appreciating the good.
i've been having nothing but a great time lately, clean pugs on all my characters, prices has been going down to balance the gold nerfs like it should and less bots overall on the usual spots.  with brels hard coming whe should have a decent time of content drougt other that classes to balance out our roster and big chills, so yeah, pretty positive so far
A week in and done my first 1340 character who's now 1415. Loving the game. Stopped playing at 700 ilvl
In before you get downvotes for actually admitting the game has improved
Ngl props to ags i see fr not many bots the citys feel much cleaner i even found people in rohendel in the middle of the night :D
What happened?
i couldnt believe i got my 4th alt 5x3 as F2p this week good stuff is happening
Go to fesnar to do your horse theif una daily and tell me bots aren't a problem still....
Been doing my part and helping carry Argos Mokokos. Abit rough when 7/8 are 1x3 lol.
Im on mari, and there are bots EVERYWHERE
i've been leveling my artist via story express and i can solidly say that the leveling areas are absolutely still riddled with bots. i think i've only encountered a handful of real players :/. maybe it's just the server i'm on (mari).
Prices being down on things has more to do with lack of ilvl to push and free 4x3 from hyper express. Fully expect shards and MHLs to jump when HM Brel drops. Engravings will spike once hyper express goes away.
Keep the gaming healthy
Will it die when throne and liberty comes out? Genuine question, assuming it’s a good game of course. I feel like Diablo IV and T&L will hit Lostark hard in the west.
Have you tried to hone lately?  How's that special material treating ya?  Need some fish or meat for food?
Clueless
If you play on EUW.. then no.. Well, I always suggest new players who started on EUW to change it to EUC. We did a mistake once.. hope we’ll have region change/merge soon.
I'm doing the story express on an alt and I can safely say I've run in to less than a handful of real players with the rest entirely being bots. Other areas of the economy are nice though.
Now i just need some vykas learning parties on up and ill feel golden lol
nothing has changed, it's still the same  bots are coming back, price of everything is going up just a matter of time to inflation to come back
Paladin is really good for the main story quest, I hope you're using the story express, saves you from quite a bit of grind later
My first char during launch was a pally too! Once u can put 10 skill points into wrath of god, watch everyone die 😍
Honestly, I can't tell if those players that are named "idldhdowkgj" are bots or players who don't care. But yeah, I've been playing for the past 3 days and have levelled up my destroyer up to level 21.  I honestly find myself spending loads on time on the Mokoko Quest, having loads of fun so far besides a couple of toxic players.
Pally is such a chill class, Punika powerpass is there when you finish questing so having one more char without leveling it again is a blast
its refreshing to see, but for some reason my group seem all doom and gloom. "Another few months of just brelshaza". I don't really see a problem. I want time to work on my roster and chill.
how did u get to 700 ilvl?
since artist release they seem to have really cracked down on bots, ags hasnt said anything about it though
Found exactly one after doing a sweep of the area, taken in Zinnervale EUC.     EDIT: Bot just got dced, rekt by captcha I would assume.  https://preview.redd.it/78phst2dwksa1.png?width=3360&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1f15c8fd67ec6dd31fa99dcb7695fe290d9b9971
horse thief daily? are you completing unas or what?
Did this once. The p2 wiped on moon boss. Told everyone to stop dying to save lifes for p2. They complied and after 10 minutes they beat the moon boss =D
I can guarantee OP is not on NA West, as im also doing story express and there are as many bots as ever, endless single file lines of sorc bots in every zone.
same here with an artist alt..........only place Ive not seen bots is feiton.......too many jumps I guess. naw: akkan
I’m on shandi, has been similar for me.
Idk man theres tons of 1560+ characters, if we have a few months of brel hard ahead nobody will be in a rush
I think T&L is going to be a very PvP-oriented game which is the exact opposite of Lost Ark. Of course, people will check it out because that's just how things are but whether it will stick remains to be seen.     Personally, I think if Lost Ark ever dies it will be through its own faults rather than another game launching. It just has too strong of an identity in the genre to not maintain a dedicated player base.     Other games launching and hype trains will grab people's attention for a while for sure, whether those games will have staying power remains to be seen though.
T&L has boring tab target combat, it's not going to take anyone from this game lol. Blue protocol on the other hand....
I think people are inflating the appeal of D4. Other than new graphics is a sad mix of D3 and the worst parts of lost ark.
No one I know is hyped about TL that plays lost ark. It just seems like a worse BDO and will most likely pop off the bat, then literally be dead in the west
idldhdowkgj is a very good sorc player
before i was aware of the sorc bots incident i couldnt be bothered naming my characters anything good so i spammed my keyboard now everyone thinks my sorc is a bot LOL
Good stuff by AGS/SG.
yeah noticing the player count dropped quite a lot.
> captcha   You guys have a captcha system there now?
LMAO, have you seen how many people have +20 brel weapons? That's 1590. Those people are Akkan ready, you think they'll "chill" on honing when brel hard drops?
That’s a good point. Blue protocol hit a more similar aesthetic too.
Pretty sure it’s just soft lock like GW2   Honestly don’t get why people hate on Arab targeting so much anyway. People praise action combat and then whine about Cali dodging their attacks, which is supposed to be the whole point of action combat forcing you to aim
There were millions of people that leveled past 20 on the beta weekend. Not sure I agree with you.
It’s Lost Ark with Blizzard’s hype so… yeah it’ll work
I thought that my computer was glitching after I saw 20 white haired sorcerers named after gibberish,  intereacting with Siera. I was so confused and thought the server was being raided by bots, I'm still unsure if they were all actual players and that them all having the same skin was coincidence or that they were actually bots.
I mean as a +20 brel weapon enjoyer i have to say... odds till +20 are decent and we just spent 4 months chilling farming content. Past 20 tho odds and mats required to hone are insane and not really worth trying to push before akkan imho, personally I'll be sitting on +19(or +20 ) till akkan. Market prices are going up already but i think it's because people are trying to do a final push rather than getting ready to hone past +20. Also end of the month's roadmap is going to be huge on market prices and wether or not people are going to push ilvl.
Hype did that. When reality sets in things will drop quickly. I could be wrong. But I watched the end game video they released this week. Very very lacking.
Playing the beta actually made me unlikely to get the full game rofl.
yea I mean d3 sold 7 million copies on release and it was one of the worst games I have ever played.
No
Sure, you're not in the top end though. Some people, and not big spenders or whales, just average grindy hardcore folk, have multiple characters at hard brel with +20 weapons.  On their main, they're gonna push it come brel hard. No one who pushed +20 weapons was being efficient. There is no reason to have any piece 1590 now, and actually there is no reason to do it likely for 1.5 months minimum. You can do it, and it can be within your budget (I'm not gonna pretend I couldn't do it myself somewhat easily), but it's not necessary. So the argument of "oh we have months of brel hard what else we gonna do" is moot, people will hone, and it won't be logical, it will be for glows or damage big number go boom, not any morsel of efficiency.
I’m not too sure I care about end game. There’s such a glut of amazing games coming down the pike I won’t have time for live service nonsense. I love the atmosphere of those games…I’ll level a character of two to max and then move on.
I guess that’s my point. They are god tier at atmosphere, story and world building. So it might borrow a player base for a little bit but live service will always retain the majority. Anyway, hope you enjoy it sir. Im gonna give it a crack too.
This will always happen as they make it easier for players to catch up.
Why not just PF it?
This is such a rare case lol.   I've been doing kungelanium on artist this entire patch daily, and I've not had a single party take longer than 5 minutes. Usual clear time is about 4, good time about 3.
True, wherever the catch up mech or honing buff stop at the mm for that guardian raid is generally ass. PF going to your best friend. But in the case of OP it happen to be much worst than normal but from experience it generally isn’t that bad or maybe my characters that do kunga is stronger
because 1550+ FPPC
On Kungel? I don't believe you. In fact I'm looking right now and there's 3 parties.       One is [this](https://b.cgas.io/EGR5AF9OCHrz.png), [2nd one](https://b.cgas.io/eAbXbBIyxSPc.png), [3rd one](https://b.cgas.io/VAfhYW2yT7ZD.png). While I was taking the screenshots 2 parties already went into it consisting of characters between 1460 - 1490. It is currently midnight in EUC.           While this may vary depending on time of day and region slightly, there is no way you can't use PF and guarantee competent teammates.
You did ass dmg as well with that time, unless you were the sup
yeah i was the support
Eh I mean if you are closer to ilvl and have 2 scrubs that's about standard. (A lot of people in matchmaking aren't even 4x3 and I have seen no gems/T2 gems in Kunga).   Started running Deska on my scrapper instead of Kunga due to this combined with the 1520+ lobbies in PF. If people are geared horribly it doesn't really matter, still a sub 4 run if I'm doing 80+ percent of the damage.
Probably a decent bit but I don't see any reason to buy this for alot considering the swift is low and can probably buy a ring/earring with Full Bloom instead and buy a really high quality neck with different engravings for far less
I think 25k will do the trick
That low quality hurts the price tremendously especially since it low rolled on the swiftness. Probably under 20k but you can list it higher and gradually reduce the price.
low swift   people rather have a ring with the class engraving and a stacked neck   if it sell for 30k thats already big
In EUC, one sold for 70k with 400 Spec and 465 Swift. Another sold for 60k with 460 Spec and 464 Swift.       I'd put the value of your necklace somewhere between 40k - 50k.
No similar necklance on the market right now, looks perfect to sell minus the quality which I'm not sure by how much would decrease the price. I can't really tell what its price should be.
Open bid 100k, no BO
Put up for like 200-250k someone will but it. Especially as it gets closer to express ending
10-20k maybe even lower since main stat is way too low
Like 35k and 10% lower and everytime it comes back
Yeah it's more of a noob trap. No player that understands the game will buy a neck lower than blue
Unfortunately, quality is most important on a necklace. So sub 50 quality would make it worth a lot less. Your necklace leans towards spec too which makes it even worse for Artists.  Imo, you have to search for rings/earrings with the same engravings + similar quality and price it lower than what's on the market. No reason for someone to buy a low quality class necklace  for a higher price when low quality class ring/earring + high quality necklace gets the same engravings with better stats.
I sold a 40 quality necklace with Blessed Aura 3 and Heavy Armour 4 for around 40k on NA West. Took about two weeks to sell.   The issue on yours is that it's low quality but even worse is that Swiftness is the lower stat. The 78 Swift loss is too much for myself personally. If I were a buyer I'd just search for similar engravings on rings or earrings.
I think people look for at least blue necklaces.
There is no way this sells for 500k. Swift is way too low. Most people go class engraving on ring so you can get away with lower quality. I’d be surprised if this sold for even 10-20k tbh. I’d start at like 20k and work down.
Nice. This is the kind of creative content this sub needs (look at all the stuff r/ffxiv has)   Are you going to sell them?
looks great!!
Do you sell these? I NEED the mokoko ones!
amazon we need mokoko merch what are you doin  ![gif](giphy|ii2SwleIFpCrhqZewv|downsized)
Yes! They’re up on my Kickstarter right now! :)
Thank you friend!
Nvm I just saw your reply about Kickstarter
Grab a napkin man you’re drooling
wdym
I’d recommend joining the regulus discord server or the lost ark discord and going to the guild channels that promote guilds and see if there’s a fitting one for you
Thanks I forgot about the discord! I'll head there
I teach a lot of raids to new players almost weekly. New players in G6 often make this mistake so I decided to make this meme in good fun about it! Stole the idea from an old stack up marker FFXIV meme!
Big respect for what you're doing. I've personally been part of 4 learning parties for Brel G6 and I don't think I'd have it in me to prog it more.        But yeah I can confirm and can't blame anyone for instinctively running away. Usually red = danger so it can throw someone off really easily.
Thanks for the laugh
why are you running?
Hahaha  Good thing its a gunlancer :D
I got killed because no one get in the circle after the spread. Btw song??
I did this today. I’ve cleared the raid on multiple characters, multiple times.  I still did this today and killed myself 😂 brain farts happen to us all
That other mech in G5 as well where you're supposed to stack to mitigate(?) damage. Especially funny when I'm on a spec class and they're a swift class booking it to Narnia.  Come baaaaaaaack!!  \*explodes\*
I have yet reached Brel 6, but I totally get it because of FF14. Also it's similar to Vykas throne stack lol
Yeah, totally agreed! It's intuitively drilled into mmo players to take red away from the team, I always get a good laugh when this happens! They had the awareness to recognize they had something that looks angry and to take it away, which in and of itself is better than a lot of people so I always compliment them on that!  🤣
<3
Hockey Stick - Kill Amethyst     The song is a lot different than you would expect, it's on spotify though!
 [DOOM Eternal OST - Cultist Base - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24W_dmJIqfA)   got you
G5 personal meteor soak mech too. Not many soak mech in LA but a ton in WoW. Always seeing people running away solo with the personal meteor then getting rekt
The song I linked must have hijacked the OST to layer in their background. Glad there is a better source, never played the new dooms!
Consistency of markers for stack/spread/soak/fall off damage is one of the main reasons I loved FFXIV's raiding. The fights were almost all one enjoyable dance once you had them down
Saw this for the first time ever this week running g5. What exactly are you supposed to do here? Couldn't find this mech described in any text guides anywhere.
In my subjective opinion, FFXIV has the best raiding in the genre. The combat isn't for everyone though.     "The fights were almost all one enjoyable dance once you had them down"     This is super true! As an AST main turned BLM enthusiast.... the dance part becomes how can I squeeze in one more fire while in leylines without getting one tapped! 🤣🤣      Optimization is my favorite part of reclearing in XIV!
Step 1 - Every one stands in the small red circle, including those with a green ring.   Step 2 - The red ring spreads a bigger one to another player, the players with the green rings get away from each other and the raid to let them explode.    Step 3 - Everyone immediately converges back to the player with the new bigger red ring.     Failure to have enough players in either red ring to "soak" causes a raid wide 60k ish damage.
“Soak” mech is a term for damage is split among members in aoe. So if one person is alone with debuff it will inflict heavy and often lethal damage. You want other players to stack together. Aka soak the damage so nobody dies
I wish I could get into FFXIV. There's a lot of things that really appeal to me but I don't think I can get past the combat.       If I had started it a decade ago there's a good chance I'd be playing it now though.
So this sounds horrible, and I hate that it is something said so much about so many games... But if you ever get the urge, force yourself through it. Just until you get to end game and can learn proper rotations and do a few end game raids with a job you enjoy. A lot of people find it to feel horrible until end game content and then end up falling in love with it later or at least dealing with it because the game has great raids.  You may not be one of those people, and may still hate it. I know a lot of people really simp for XIV... but it really is a special game I always return to for the new patches. It's definitely not for everyone with all that said, but I always try to tell people to give it a real chance and get to end game. Which can take a LONG fucking time if you enjoy the story and pay attention to it. One of the best pieces of writing in any form of media in my opinion after you get to the expansions. How they keep one uping themselves every expansion is beyond me!     EDIT: If you do get into it you can message me! Playing games with friends is always more enjoyable especially in XIV and it's designed so end game players can do all old content and still feel rewarded for doing it so helping newer players isn't a waste of time!
It is very rough to get in to and many jobs are just plain not fun till level 50+ plus 300-400 hours of story to get to endgame (if you read and dont skip cutscenes).  The end game loop is worth it and respects an individual's time more than most MMOs (plus Yoshi P has gone on record saying if you need a break take it).
Yeah a lot of my friends who are into FFXIV basically had to force themselves through it. One of them almost dropped it but just tagged along with his friends because they wanted to play together and now he's pretty much addicted lmao.          I might give it another shot, though I think it'll take quite a while until I will because Lost Ark still has my full time and attention and i'm not even close to burning out yet. I do also wanna give Blue Protocol a shot.             Also cheers for the offer, while I do have a lot of friends who play FFXIV, almost all of them are in NA and I already have pretty shifty internet, so connecting from EU to NA servers would probably not be the best idea.
I second this. I can quit for months and come back right where I left off right into the new raid tier just fine. I literally quit for a year at one point and within like 2 weeks of playing was caught up.     The game gives you a lot of fun optional side content that FEELS like optional content you can do if you want it, or you can just play something else.
Ah yea, play in EU then! I'm in NA myself as well. Do what you find fun, just consider giving it a real chance in the future if you find yourself ready to try something else! LoA made me stop playing FFXIV for the last year minus new major raid releases XD
That's a nice Stone for a 5x3 +1 chaos dungeon build ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)
That's why you don't cut useless stones even for fun you never know when you will hit that one in a million chance
7th 9/9 (any 18 node) stone posted to Reddit. Still only 1 10/9 so far from a Redditor.
welcome to the 9-9 club brother
Sidenote, kind of a ripoff that the vitality bonus doesn't increase past 16 successes.
Chaos set is going to be lit
I guess u can build 5x3+1 chaos dungeon build.
What is it? I can't see on phone
Yikes
my man wasted his failstacks
I love starting a game brand new and seeing posts like this that just tell me 1. I have absolutely no fucking clue what you're talking about 2. Because of this I know I have so fucking much to learn and look forward to
Kinda deserved tbh
You shoulda stopped the moment it started going too well
put that man on suicide watch
It’s chaos dungeons why would you cut a stone for them LMFAOOO
Are all people joking in the comments? Ur next chance on 9-7 remains the same and it does not depend on stones cut in the past. Those events are mutually exclusive.
See ya in 2 months
OP was like:  NINE NINE NINE!!!
5x3+2 in less than a week if OP is feeling spicy xD
Not sure if joke, cuz not funny, so assuming it isn't: naw, that's a pretty bad chaos stone. Adrenaline is useless on most classes in chaos.
that's not a "useless" stone he's clearly just was trying to cut a stone for chaos build
How can they farm internet points and attention if they won't do this?
Does 6/6/6 count
nine nine!
9/9/1 stone but adrenalin preemp strike
... yes people are joking. We know this, but it's funnier and more convenient to say it matters so when the next stone is shit we can blame it on that.
🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓
With adrenaline, an engraving that its negated by the other engraving in that stone, preemptive strike
Well, do you even need a stone with preemptive strike stone for a chaos build? you can just put leg preemptive eng and leg class eng there and find 1 or 2 accessories to complete those 2, with some heavy armor or fortitude if you want those, pretty cheap and easy. Cutting a stone is weird to me.
preemptive strike and adrenaline are exact opposites... you dont use both
... Time for eo SF spirit bomb? :'D
If you don’t one-shot with Preemptive then you really gotta show ‘em who’s boss, and the only way to do that is to make sure crit a second time 🫠
Adrenaline still gives attack, not just crit. Artist also has a lot of multi hit skills that won’t one shot easily under preemptive
hey now adreanline also gives attack power
Depends on how deep you want to go. I made mine full 4x3+1. It’d be 5x3 but stones suck
sure u can do instead and maybe some ppl prefer to cutt a preemptive stone instead, my point is this guy was cutting this stone for a reason and not just fcking around cutting random stones
Robust spirit is the one with spirit bomb and preemptive strike doesn’t work on awakenings :,)
…no
Yeah, but that's 6%, vs 17.5% on Contender. Adrenaline is just bad for most chaos builds. Also, multi-hit is bad in chaos on most classes, unless every hit can oneshot, like Starry Night.
Uh… my ghetto artist is doing 1475 chaos as an i1475 toon and one shots with four skills.  Tiger, crane, that ink spray thing, the carp thing, and One Stroke (mini boss killer).  I don’t even cast anything else really.   I keep heavy armor and switch my other three to Recurrence, Preemptive, and Cursed Doll.  Works just fine.  Only thing that doesn’t die in one hit is phase 2 big boss, and after a preemptive One-stroke opener, it’s dead in a couple more quick skills.
Preemptive 100% does work on awakenings, but it doesn't matter because it doesn't work on raid bosses.
That was the joke I tried to cheer up with.  Wasn't serious lol
You have more than two engravings. Can have Preemptive/contender/class/Adrenaline for example.  Is there a more top tier build? Probably. Does it actually matter? No not really. Adrenaline is just a nice bonus when other bases are covered   I agree multi hit isn’t the most desirable, but not like keeping up adrenaline is hard when all you’re doing is spamming skills.
Exactly because of soulfist as well, since early in lost ark you'd have 3 classes that could boost an SFs dmg and then have them one shot bosses with preemptive spirit bomb
Liking the Maharaka design and vibe. And ofc you can't say tropical without Albion lol
your sh looks amazing
>Is this useful?  It has 1 malice, better redoit.
A 9/9 stone allows you to go for 5x3+2 with any engraving of your choice being the +2 I believe. Perfect stone.
Alto putano confucklations!
congratulations u won the lottery
Pray you'll never get tired of playing Sorc because this stone is a one in a life-time type chance.
I don't usually say this, but this is actually cringe. "Is this useful?".....
Illegal.
I just dialed 9-1-1.
fun fact, its just an alt xD
6x3 is real, now swap to Igniter and profit XD, which link tool hermano?
What the fuck
Demencia legion commander.
8th 9/9 (18 nodes) i've seen on reddit  grats.   rencor lol, sounds like rancor
Correct. OP is a sorc so this tidbit isn't relevant to them, but there are a select few classes that can use a class engraving at level 2 over adrenaline and this is the ONLY way to do that in a 5x3+2 setup.
991 you mean
No. It's your main  9/9 stone is currently the single best thing you can get since you can get any +2 engraving with ancient. You won the game. There are so many builds that ppl do not consider because it requires a 9/9 so they go for the second best build, which is possible with a 9/7 (which of  is also highly unlikely). Big I'm sure you know that and just wanna flex so confuckyoulations
Can't even do it with a 10/10 rock lol
We're gonna track down this "hermano" guy and nail him.
Nope still can't do 6x3  6x3 is 90 nodes   24 from double leg books   45 9 x 5 accessories   18 from 9/9 stone   87...still 3 nodes short
No I believe they mean literally any engraving at +2 meaning they could go Adren 2 with this stone.
That's why this is kind of sick. You don't need to make *either* of the engravings on the stone the level 2 with a 9/9.
Definition of any aside, HM2 isn't bad. It's a bog-standard 3/8/16% engraving, which means it's a better +2 than engravings that really need to be at 3 like AoA and KBW. It's worse than Adrenaline 2, of course, but that doesn't make it *bad*. Adrenaline is an outlier for how good the L2 is. There are a decent number of people on the rankings running CD2/HM2 if they get a suboptimal 9/7 because Adr3+HM2 still beats HM3+Adr1. People don't like to hear it, but it would even be worth running Grudge 2 if that was the only way to get a 5x3+2.
its not really negative at all, the guy asking the question would be valid if he was a newbie, but its like winning the lottery after consistently playing it and then asking: Are 100 Million even a good amount of money, can i do with it anything?   The guy who asked the question must be either mentally disabled or just want to flex, there is nothing inbetween xd  But if you say anything, there are always people that say; "bro its not that deep, why are you so jelous" you literally cant comment nowadays without getting backlash for literally existing lol
Ah, I thought that it has to be one of those 2, since the +2 is always the 7 on a 9/7 and didnt think that 9/9 shifts it. TIL
This is going to get downvotes but oh well.  You know it's funny because in the other mmos I've played, whenever someone gets lucky with rng, and share it, they usually get a 'nice' or a simple 'gg'. Doesn't matter if it's a humble brag or a flex. People are just happy someone is having a good time and lucky, believing that positive karma will come to them as well.   But here? Man, some people are so bitter when they see it that they can't even pretend to be a good sport about it.  That's kind of sad about this community.   (Now watch, downvotes incoming because this is LoA reddit)
The guy legit says ‘greetings from Argentina <3’ and gets a barrage of hate. This community is fkd.
Look at my profile, tell me if I'm one of those bitter people.
Don't personally care if you are or aren't because it's not my business and it is frankly cringe to care that much what a stranger thinks of you.
If you didn't buy the 1100 RC pack which gives you 2600BC that's the best and most worth stuff in the whole RC shop tbh anything else is not remotely good as the 1100 pack because that pack alone give you 6 months of crystalline aura
The ark pass has a great amount of mats for honing and otherwise. You should definitely buy the whole thing especially if you want the skin. If you don't care about the honing mats then just covert crystals and buy them separately.
The BC skin is character bound so it depends on how you want to use it imo. I but the Ark Pass's premium tiers because I have 5 mages and can share the skin between them. That makes it a lot more worth to me than buying 2-5 skins
Join the lost ark mokokos discord. There are learning parties from valtan to brel on a weekly basis. You can DM me for invite link.
Join the discord link down on the right side of the subreddit. Assign whatever roles like what regions youre from etc etc --> looking for group / raid / static --> make a post or look for others wanting to do a learning run.
If you are looking for someone to teach you, that will be a lot harder to find.  If you are looking to learn the raid..ie prog it.  then I would suggest just making a learning party and you should have plenty to join your group.   I would also recommend practicing Prokel if you are DPS.  You will find it easier if you are willing to go in or be a backup.  The problem I see with a lot of people trying to do learning parties/join them is that they have  crazy bad setups on their character... IE rainbow stats, not 5x3, wrong engravings and so forth.  Make sure you have a good setup on your character before trying to make or join a learning party or any party.
Lootheroes discord regularly has classes. Like every day at least one of each gate or two. Search the web for invite or this reddit.
Is it possible to get that link too?? Two buddies and I have been doing the 1-4 Brel grind and want to start to prog 5-6
I'd like to get a link of the mokoko dc please. Thank you!
I sent you the link, but not sure if you are getting it. Let me know.
I need to do 5-6 as well. Can i have a link???
Link sent
It's honestly the best time to start. Catch up mechanics allow you to zoom quickly to end game.  You honestly might have quit on launch due to how slow progression was.
I also played for around 2 weeks on launch and started playing again a week ago. So far I've been having a lot of fun, although I'm just now reaching the level to do raids.  From what I hear, if you are a new player you need to find other new players and/or become friends with older players, possibly joining a guild. I think this game is only soloable if you have been playing from the start and you keep up with max level content.  Otherwise you need to befriend people so that you can do raids where you may have to retry several times without frustrating experienced people who just want to get it done.
I don't know. Once upon a time I would have said no way. However t1 and t2 guardian content is dead.  Unless you can easily make friends, this game is brutal. Starting off, you will likely be kept out of high tier content unless you have a decent roster level. Try to find a guild.  And you are stuck playing catch up and as new content releases, it becomes harder to learn new raids like clown and above.  Then there is a lot of gatekeeping in the game and honestly some part is necessary or people will imposter their way into raids. People can also get toxic.  However some is undeserving, gatekeeping solely based on class doesn't make sense for 1475 and higher content but people do it anyway.  The gameplay and classes are amazing, free respec is also nice. Campaign is amazing quality.  You will also need to study raids in detail.  It is hard to catch up now, but it is doable. It just takes a lot of time. Best is if you have friends joining with you
Depends on the type of player you are. You will progress at a lot faster pace than you could have at launch. There are currently 3 progression events that will skyrocket your prog. If you want to do new content/raids day 1 it will take you maybe a week to make it to the start of end game content, but probably a few months to catch up to the ilvl that most other people are at. If the fact that the grind to fully catch up bothers you then I wouldn't start. Otherwise there are multiple raids to enjoy and you'll catch up in ilvl at a steady pace
If you can find friends/a guild go for it. If not, don't bother.  Without a guild, you will spend many more hours in party finder than in the raids themselves since no one wants to take a chance on a new player. It's not worth it.
never too late! it's a fun journey, just recommend finding a guild or friends who can help you learn the raids
Lost ark reminded you of lineage 1? The fuck
The sooner you start the better, it's never too late and right now is prime starting time with the events currently in place.  Finding a guild or discord of helpers will make your life much simpler when you get to raids/for questions.
Do not play this game, my friend.  And that's coming from someone who plays almost everyday like a clown.
[removed]
people have already said what i came here to say, so ill add that tradeable founders items, especially if still in their respective selection chests, sell for a large amount of gold on the mb. once youre 1445 from story express and then hyper express events, you can think about selling these to help you catch up even more.
this game has some of the best catchups I've seen tbh. and the longer you wait the easier the catchups become.  the only thing they could do more is just automatically give you free 1370s or something. which they basically do already since honing is 100% success and doesn't cost any gold  or stuff.
Yes
To be honest it is, there many RNG gated stuff outside of honing, like tripods, cards, quality to some extend. Not to mention gems that getting say to end game like brel hard would not be feasible. You'd enjoy sitting in lobby on several cases which may end in disband or cetera. Pugging outside of any tangible static or guild is atrocious for new players wanting to reach current content, comes from a vet having 7 1540 and near 2 extra 1520s.
Any good Plato find a new friendly guild?
Was a combo. Open worldish down view.  ( no game will ever be lineage 1,  if NA had not closed I’d still play it!)(LOA strength mage forever!!)
I will never understand why people say this lmao. It's like they want their game to die. It''s not even a funny joke either
Do play this game, my friend.  And that's coming from someone who plays everyday like a clown.

Ya I opened them. Have the pally and striker (think that’s the ryu ninjaish one)
I'm not joking. Plus, game is dead anyways wdym?
Anyone want to run some clowns?
Can only get it by playing on the JP version
I don't play in EU but I'm in NAE and I was able to enable KR voice pack. I assume JP voicepack was also there as an option but I don't have access to the game right now so I can't check, but it should be somewhere in the Audio settings.
Unless there is a way to like install it manually I don't think you can like you said only KR is on steam for us
No, the JP voice pack is property of the japanese region publisher therefore our version does not have it.
i dont understand why they dont let us have the jp voice pack if they have jp server :/
only kr is available in the audio settings
Licensing.  AGS has nothing to do with the JP server.  The localization was handled by a different company and they don't even have rights to it.
Ahh well rip, time to reject anime and become a koreaboo I guess.
My friend tried to buy multiple while it was on sale. It didn’t allow them to purchase more than one. After you buy the discounted ticket, during the transaction I think it actually says 1/1
No you cant, just tried it.   https://preview.redd.it/pvo6y1klzksa1.png?width=504&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=958bd659b1ffd1ca59670788987043cccd230b26
If it doesnt say 1/1 or a number, it's unlimited. The tickets now give you 24hours to change your appearance as well.
I think the problem is it only allows you to have one reskin ticket at a time, but this is why I was asking.
No, you can have multiple at a time. I have three right now.
Depends on how long you want to wait. Technically all skins will go up in price generally, but the easy popular ones are gonna be the swimsuits and the 2nd Anniversary Skins/Gunner weapon skins.
Anyone who knows the best one is not gonna tell you about it
The skin-tight pants
If I knew, I'd buy hundreds of them and I wouldn't tell you
Don't think there are any tbh. Some of the best skins in the game which were very highly praised and worth a lot later on, in KR at least, were the event anniversary skins.  Sold a bunch of those in the beginning and held onto several for much later to sell.
Wait for maid outfit
No one can know for sure. You can look at Korea, but they prefer all those thousands of casual wear skins which all look the same. On Global general consensus seems to be that Fantasy skins are much better.
Last Gunslinger weapon, probably.
Scrapper gloves always do very well, the cat paws are expensive now and will for sure go even higher in value, the 2nd anniversary  weapon skin for them is super cool too, sadly you can't dye it but I'm sure a lot of people dye around a piece like that sometimes.
The only real answer here is probably the “chic” tank top for Gunslinger. Everyone wants the booba.
Foreskin
So you want to buy a skin with gold and resell it later and you think it will make you this huge profit that’s worth months of waiting? I think there’s better ways of making gold. Skin selling is for those who buy them with real money to squeeze out couple thousands more than they would when buying gold directly from the shop
The Neria skins often go up in price until a certain point then people start selling them for cheap
That or buying skin with royal crystal and sell it now or later
Only thing that’s worth it is buying them with RC and selling right away if you were gonna buy gold with real money anyway. Otherwise it’s not worth it, sitting on skins for months waiting for their price to go up, they can lose value or gain value depending what direction economy takes, so it’s a bad gamble for not much potential gain.
Adding onto this point, if you want to buy something to speculate on prices, skins are not that good of an avenue compared to something like shard pouches/fish/leapstone. If you look at older pets or skin selection chests, there are sometimes days where theres not a single sale.      Even if you buy a bunch and the price goes up, it'll take forever to liquidate your inventory. Your gold could be forever locked into those skins even if on paper they're worth a lot, but no one is buying.
Okey, thanks for the tips!

The telltale sign here is trying to build a story out of useless facts. What you did before you logged off, that it's a holiday in Brazil. None of this matters or has anything to do with the fact OP was 'hacked', he's trying to add to the storytelling to build a case.  Alternatively to the pilot accusations, he could have tried to sell the account - got it stripped then charged back.

Now with all honesty there is anything amazon can do if you either download some sketchy file and now your computer is corrupted or someone knows your log-in information from other sources.   https://preview.redd.it/cnut5597qisa1.png?width=1048&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3d75c2f10e30cdfbe20a549e5469c1cf414a5132
this guy probably bought an piloted service lmao
98% you took a Piloting. Take your L and move on.
Have you ever EVER given away your steam login info to ANYONE?? If not, do you suspect anyone who is living with you?
You have to actively participate in getting yourself hacked these days. Sorry you did the dumb OP. Learn the lesson.
You can check your steam login history to see ip / location etc. Not sure if this will help in something or not.
That would've required access to your steam account. You haven't logged in to any suspicious sites/bought pilots/reused passwords?
You did give login info and got scammed didnt you? I highly doubt these "hackers" will be able to bypass steam guard, also first thing hackers do first is to change your steam password and better yet your username. These "hackers" did not change anything according to your story.   So you bought piloted run and gave your account info for outsider hence your broke steam and lostark EULA so get fucked.  Also just come clean what really happens, admitting it wont hurt you more.
bro even my friend dog random vpn account asked for a permission code to login 2days in a row before I could login without it asking there is noway  u didnt give ur email/account to someone
Aint no way you just get randomly hacked in 2023 now WITH Steam Guard. Just be truthful and mention you bought an pilot service lol
On the bright side you have a lot of awakening shards.
Hi OP, first of all, sorry for your loss and hopefully support gets back to you. Secondly, I think it's good to take a breather and trace your steps of how your account was accessed.   This seems to be a Lost Ark targeted attack. The culprit knew what to look for to steal from your account, even down to the silver draining method such as draining your silver by buying awakening shards.   1) Did you access any fishy looking websites telling you to login using steam auth? Some phising websites are designed to look like the legitimate ones.  2) As far as I know, there are only 2 methods one can get access to your account remotely. This is assuming you have the steam mobile auth.   The first method is via steam backup codes, which you might have generated for whatever reason. With the first method, an email will get sent to you if one of the code is used up. The hacker might've gotten access to your email(?) too somehow.  The second way is if you have let someone on your account from another PC device. Steam mobile auth would have told you to press "Confirm". The person can also login to your account remotely without steam auth code if you had the "Remember password on this device" option ticked.  All in all, because this is a Lost Ark targetted attack and OP said he didn't share his info to anyone. I just  is kind of weird since Steam Authentication seems to be pretty secure if you never shared your info with anyone.
So, after a lot of research i find out someone from china and someone from kr got into my account today, still don't know how, i have steam guard activate and they still got into my account. No i didn't let anyone pilot my account and didn't click in any phishing website. Probably my password in another site is the same and got leaked and people enter in my LA. But  like [**CombinationDirect165**](https://www.reddit.com/user/CombinationDirect165/)  said, this people know how to drain my silver and take my things. Just letting anyone know, change yours PW if possible because i still don't know how they enter. Anyway thanks for the people who was kind and polite.
The most likely scenario is that you use the same account name and password in multiple websites and one of those got compromised. Do not use the same PW everywhere!
report yourself as gold seller and rmter, see if Amazon will ban the one who got the thing. JK talk to Amazon again saying your account got hacked. And then file complaint to BBB about Amazon do nothing to protect your online property
Is your steam 2fa not on you should double check, cause that’s HIGHLY unlikely especially for a lost ark acc unless u gave someone access urself.
Doubtful. Pilot for a certain clear?
For sure op bought his way to a hell mode carry and got fucked 🫣
So many people think steam has Military level security. Just No. There's a chance OP may had given someone his login credentials AND his 2FA code for a carry, but my steam account got also compromised a few months ago, someone sold all my Dota2 items for a few cents less than the amount where Steam Guard is required and then bought a really overpriced item from a Russian account. I don't have a fucking clue how they did it and from the login history it looked like I did it from my own pc. I contacted steam and they just sent me a link to their FAQ. They probably got my password from some random stolen user DB's, but I don't know how they entirely skipped 2FA and even email notifications. After all the hacking drama that has been on the internet over the last year (uhm... LTT for example) , for me it looks like you can never be 100% safe.
So you probably got hacked and the hacker deleted your emails.  I would scan your computer with   https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download
I'm honestly shocked as to how someone hacked your steam account... honestly, how does that happen? I'm clueless.  I have phone verification so I imagine I'm not gonna be hacked... so, how? Maybe a weird email with a link that he clicked on? Hmmm
I can’t help you but wish you the very best hope u get a bit atleast back this really really really sucks dude
As usual, it's obvious the dude got scammed and is now trying to hide the fact he got scammed for a carry or got scammed during RMT.
I got no real advice. But seeing how many believe you've been giving your credentials for a pilot run, I just want to say not everyone thinks so.   If I were you I would seriously investigate how this happened, to prevent it happening again and to other system. Like if someone knows your password and you use the same on on email, steam etc, they can do all sorts of things. If you had mobile steam guard it should have prevented this. If you have only email guard then they can have access to both and use it just like your own account.
>Someone got into my account (i have steam guard activate and nothing is in my email or my celphone)  Firstly, I need to point out Steam Email login verification is not a real "Steam guard" thing. It must be something like this:  https://preview.redd.it/rc3akntcmmsa1.png?width=471&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e4e98f0c5542f44ffb387cb507ce79a7cfd1499f  I wonder if OP knows how 2FA works. I have this feature enabled and never got anything stolen from my Steam account for over a decade.  OP either logged in at a 3rd party website via their Steam account, didn't use the Steam mobile guard, or "lent/shared" their accout to someone
Faz umas duas semanas que eu vi uma pessoa no servidor SA falando que aconteceu isso com ela, roubaram tomas as gemas e o gold.  Será que isso tá acontecendo com mais gente? Você é um jogador frequente ou casual? Fico até com medo. Também tenho autenticação e tudo mais, mas vai saber como eles conseguem essas coisas.
You paid for a service out of game. If you didn't this would have never happened.
You payed someone to clean up your character(s).   Good investment I'd say. :)
in before  "Get fucked and change your password."  Sorry about your account... but also  >"Someone got into my account (i have steam guard activate and nothing is in my email or my celphone)"  That just isn't possible.  You bought an inferno carry and they ripped you off.
Thank you, will try to do this
Pray one of the Indian cs agents LOOOOLL
Let alone through steam. It's possible to get your computer compromised sure (by installing software from shady download links) but even then your windows software will prevent most damage, and even then the odds of it being someone from lost ark is basically 0.  Amazon isn't in the picture here, either their computer was "hacked" or steam, you could go to steam support for compromised account if you'd like.  Regardless even if OP is lying (I literally work in security field so i deal with people in these situations all the time), I'm still sorry it happened to you OP, it doesn't make it any more or less fair. But the reality is there's not much you can do but take the lesson and move on.  If by chance someone from lost ark DID compromise your steam account details AS WELL as your email details, then bypassed your email security, all to delete your stuff on lost ark. Then take this as a lesson and improve your email security and change your passwords, two factor will obviously completely nullify any fears and the only way i can imagine this being possible is if the passwords were the same / shared on other online sites that were compromised  That would be an absolutely astonishing amount of effort on their end though
Not necessarily. If you use a common password and your email is known. Its not that hard to do it if you have the tools. However, it is far more likely that they got got by social engineering and are not telling the whole truth.
What are those?
He probably forgot to mention the pilot he paid for in between doing his valtans on his sharpshooter and destroyer and going to sleep. 🤣
either that or he bought an account and it got yoinked back cause its super easy to do on steam... buying steam accounts is super sus
What tricks do these hell carry people use?
They're from Brazil though. Does SA have those carries?
I assume OP may assume enabling steam login email verification code as "steam guard" which is defnitely not the same we're talking about.  If OP only used this authentication method, it is actually fairly easy to hack his Steam account if their email was compromised.
Exactly, less confusion here and much more story building and explanation. Dudes a liar, plain and simple
I'm surprised this isn't more well known. Anytime someone adds stuff that has absolutely nothing to do with the situation, they are either lying or beating around the bush to distract you.   This hacker can just bypass a 2FA and they're using it to get $5 worth of items off an account to sell on RMT sites?
[removed]
Yea, if he paid for pilot he is both an idiot and a disgrace. Should have done hell himself
Haven't played since August. What's piloting?
Never did, not even my friends. And i live alone
So why you can presume i did some wrong ? why i would let someone pilot my account ? i know i didn't do anything. But okay you do you
I don't know if you're innocent or not, but I feel bad for the amount of victim blaming you're getting, especially if you're telling the truth. I hope you're innocent and get your things back.
nah it happened to one of my friend's alt accounts that he used for rmt. heres the steam login history: [https://i.imgur.com/vnbq09a.png](https://i.imgur.com/vnbq09a.png) china and korea.   So... u/Spirytt1 probably either did 1 of 3 things; bought his account if hes in SEA to circumvent publishing rights and got screwed over, bought hell vykas/valtan service or rmted. Different os types as well. probably using a Chinese bot called KP or running everything thru hyper-v / quemu on a mass server for botting.
Most likely scenario is this guy RMT'd/Account shared/Piloted and thought he was one that will get away. Two authentication Steam and got hacked over night and the guy who hacks the account somehow also plays Lost Ark? Coincidentally much?
How does a steam account getting compromised mean Amazon is at fault? I get why AGS gets some hate here and there but come on, at least be reasonable with it.  This is not even mentioning the fact that a compromised steam account is at the fault of the user anyway. Steam is one of the most secure platforms in the world if the user is competent.
steam runs on chromium you can easily steal session tokens or clone them. can also back them up via a reg edit along with grabbing a few files from the pc itself. he could have a RAT. but most likely just got scammed from a piloting service.
So a few things.  First, I'm sorry this happened to you, and I'll take the benefit of the doubt and believe you. I'm not denying a single thing being said, and obviously your bias/experiences can lead you to any conclusion you want, and I have no right to try to convince otherwise.  However, I just want to give my own opinion on a few statements being said. First, about your situation, I strongly think the problem here is a lack of information. That's not your fault, and you may never find out how you got your steam hacked, but not having that information is why you can draw the conclusion "you just got hacked and they bypassed 2fa", there could be an unlimited middle steps that you or I could imagine that actually could make it make sense.  Second, "military level security", this here bothers me. It's nothing like that, it's that login security has evolved to the point pretty much "login military security" or whatever is a standard. For context here my job is Apple, when it comes to something having more security then another it's not about whether or not it has fFA or how strong it's 2FA is. There isn't really levels of the security beyond that, what does determine security is all the things behind that scenes that's *completely unrelated* to the login process itself. This is the multitude of ways to protect your account and information past or prior to the login  So you bring up the hacking drama, a great example because it shows what hacking today is, and that's databases. The LTT forum did get it's database hacked, in fact MANY databases get hacked, and this has to do with the security. Once a database is hacked, the hackers get access to thousands of logins/passwords and other site information right, as well as cookies and all that jazz. This information is then sold, as well as personal information, to sites that sell bots account details. Some people use the same password/email combination on other sites, and there you go accounts be compromised. (ignoring 2FA)  This is completely unrelated to the case here, because if amazon did get account information hacked and an incredible amount of database information, it would effect a magnitude of people. It also would not effect 2FA, which you and the OP claim never occured.  Someone previously mentioned the Sim Swap, which is high end for bypassing 2FA for scammers, but EVEN THAT just reroutes the 2fa code to their number, it does not bypass 2FA completely. There is always more sides to the story, some parts that are missing that can paint a picture. Another thing to mention is that hacking itself is such a massive risk, and hackers that do it (that hack databases and scam) need to have a high reward equal to the cost of leaving a virtual fingerprint.  &#x200B;  Now, with all that out of the way, let me wrap this up. I am not saying it was your fault for what happened, or that it's your fault for missing vital information that could explain how this was all bypassed. I also agree that if it could happen to you, it could happen to anyone. The issue here is that it's incredibly unlikely due to the nature of this post (tons of irrelevant and strange information, somehow instantly concluding it was a hack and not a bug, and just knowing the amount of times this happens to people who use the same story as op, and lastly that they know that their resolution is with amazon and doesn't care at all that their steam itself was hacked)  2FA and security itself isn't perfect, but it really thins the herd, and the provided information just doesn't add up
I like how you bring up LTT.  In LTTs situation, it was 100% a user error. The hack occurred due to someone clicking on a compromised file which was actual malware designed to hijack the session token. This is the only way 2fa can be bypassed like this.  This is a very common steam scam and has been happening for at least 10 years. Someone tells you to download something, and when you run it, it will copy the local session key from your steam files. Anyone who is in the csgo/Dota trading community knows about this.
>but my steam account got also compromised a few months ago, someone sold all my Dota2 items for a few cents less than the amount where Steam Guard is required and then bought a really overpriced item from a Russian account.  More details?  Is your Steam guard a mobile app or just email code authentication? The latter is far less secure. The first can't be easily compromised unless your mobile phone is controlled by someone remotely.

No one didnt. He gave login info and got scammed.
I've had a situation where my steam account was stolen despite having steam guard. During COVID lockdown, google had a record of my exact computer connecting from halfway around the world in Russia, so I guess the hackers found some way to spoof it.   Not saying that your explanation isnt also likely (what are the chances you get hacked and they only target your lost ark account?), but it is possible.
PLEASE update us, this sounds terrible! Some people have even been able to get back pieces that they accidentally dismantled, and that's 100% their fault. This is 0% your fault, so I'm hopeful that they will be able to make it right.
Yeah not sure how the guy got access through his STEAM with email. To be honest if someone can go through my steam I would be more worried about my account. That means this guy has access to my email and can bypass new login detection. Either the guy can literally control his computer or he gave someone else access. So even while typing this right now someone could be on his computer.
If you think two factor nullifies any fear of conpromise, then you never heared of sim swapping lol.
You pay people to pilot your account to get hell mode titles so he can scam lobbies. Op gave login information to scammers and got hacked instead of his title.
Maybe he didn't go to sleep but rather just gave his account to a pilot and got fucked and immediately went here to try and get stuff back. Unfortunately it won't work
No tricks. They just say they'll log into your account for you and get it all done. People willingly hand over accounts to them with zero proof they've actually ever done this service.   These things don't exist. There is no one doing this for you even if they say to use PayPal to pay them. Anything that says they need your account info is a scam. Period.
Why wouldnt they? lol  Gullible mfers in every region.
First off, of course they do. There are capable players on every server. Second, even if there weren’t any from SA, a player from any other region could easily VPN there and fulfil the service.
No, there arent any hellkas and helltans in SA, im from arthetine and never saw those in public only statics try hell mode.
Uuuh the armchair psychologists. No1 is safe anymore!

Someone plays your account for you. So op has to give login information so they can earn his title for him.
u gave it to me to pilot your account and get u atd. /s
Because it is literally impossible to break 2FA if OP told the truth, not to mention the hacker knows the value of Lost Ark items - all the odds added up are 0% to be considered as valid.
I don't think you understand how these account stealers operate.  They usually buy lists with multiple tens of thousands of compromised accounts from all kind of website and they use bots to try the combinations on various platforms that has value.  When they get a hit, one of two things happen.  1. They go through the steam inventory and clean what they can 2. They look at the games owned that can have trading elements and clean them themselves.  or  1. They look at the games owned and sell the login information to another party that will then clean it.
So you mean as a online game company AGS has zero methods to protect its players online properties and if they get hack they just lose everything and nothing they can do to get anything back?
Wow thanks for the answer, yeah my point was only that most opinions were granting for sure that these things don't happen and the only way of getting hacked is purposely trying to do some kind of action that is again ToS. As you say, I'm sure 9.9 out of 10 cases are triggered by user error, mine probably too.  I can not condemn nor defend OP, but I'm glad you gave a detailed explanation of the problem and your point of view as someone who has  knowledge on the field.
Yep, user error and social engineering are probably the most common causes, I don't blame Amazon or Steam, but user mistakes that end up with their account being hacked don't have to purposely be related to them trying to pay for account piloting, or some kind of obscure chinese hack.

The only way that a session can be spoofed on steam is if the user downloads something fishy which clones the session file. This is 100% a user error.
..It's even possible it's the hacker who posted this trying to restore the account owner's items just so they can delete them all again assuming his reddit is linked to his google account that was compromised to get through steam security  The plot thickens
Context bro, i'm talking about this kind of specific situation. Sim swap is a massive scale with massive risks, nobody is going to compromise email/steam and sim swap to delete items  Sim Swapping is for scamming
i don't even have interest in hell mode titles
Bruh.. So when rmt isn't enough to carry your skilless ass you need to pay someone to log in your account to earn titles for you? Ahah hilarious.
You can’t hack a steam account with just a username and password when it has 2fa.  Talk about dunning Kruger.
Account authentication is handled through Steam so there’s only so much AGS can do in additional to the numerous safeguards steam has in place, and given the nature of the AH it’s hard to revert resources if they did manage to get stolen
This reminds me of when there was a wave of RMTers complaining about their gold / gems being gone on this sub, which coincidentally happened at the height of the bot infestation that was occurring last year lmao.
Pretty much and op got scammed instead.. not much sympathy from me lol
Not everyone use 2fa, far from it.
He literally states he has steam guard.  And if you’re not running 2fa on something like Steam in 2023, it really is your fault.
1540 and 1560, yeah.       Resting isn't worth it when it comes down to mats, but if you wanna gamba for ancient accessories go for it. I'll do the same because gamba is fun.
If you're the type of person who always runs your dailies, then no, not worth saving it.  If you're a guy who doesn't give a shit and just runs whenever you feel like it, then save it.
If you are already doing rested on all chars like me, then it is the smart way to do it lmao.
Only worth stacking rest bonus if u already do rested chaos dungeons, if u do it every day it's not worth it, we're not getting a soft reset like we had with 1490
Depends on what you want to prioritize. Other people have mentioned the gamba for accessories and bracelets, but if you do save up you actually end up with more shards than you would have by doing chaos everyday in that interim especially if you hit 1560 chaos. You will lose out on other drops and especially silver, but for me this is worth it.
Are you doing rested anyway? Then yes.
I just wanna a excuse to do it rested
Also worth saving if you're doing rested anyways. Rested 1540/1560 > Rested 1520
I just wanted an excuse to not do chaos for basically a week personally.
First off play what you like. No point in playing a video game if you don't enjoy it.  I've been an FE main since western launch. I knew barrage was superior in terms of damage but gameplay didn't appeal to me.  DPS difference between barrage is about \~15% I believe. Not insignificant, but both specs are still around middle of the pack/higher in the list.  Old arti players might say it's bad if they're using the old full swiftness build which is significantly worse than the new full crit build.  Edit: Forgot to mention. Even though we can't know for sure, I don't think I've ever been gatekept for being FE. There was only one time where someone made a joke after I joined the lobby "FIREPOWER NOOOOOO ;\_;" but it was lighthearted and we shittalked each other afterward so it was all good. Even in the same lobby, another player said they play both arti builds and they were both good, so people saying FE is bottom tier probably never tried it or they're parroting others' opinions from before the rework where it was indeed pretty "meh" compared to other options
we have many FPE arty 1500+ i don't think it's gonna be a problem.
I’m an FPE main with level 7/8 gems (8 is mostly on cooldown). I find myself on the mvp screen, even if I’m not the mvp, which is fine for me. I am heavily invested into it however.   While yes the damage is lower than Barrage, your damage is more consistent and you take significantly less damage because you’re not a cripple that requires babysitting by a support. FPE is also one of the better classes for equalized content (challenge guardians/dungeons).   FPE has better stagger than barrage (solo stagger clown). FPE is middle pack of dps (though full swift FPE is probably bottom).   You won’t be gate kept. There’s also a lot of barrage players who don’t know boss attacks yet, and as a result miss their turret or build meter way too fast in other raids. FPE can easily do more damage than them.
It's a fine spec man just play whatever you like. Damage is solid, great stagger, has weakpoint, is fairly tanky, and pretty fast/easy to play so you won't be floor pov. Only reason you'd be gatekept is if your gear/stats are bad.   What stat split were you thinking of going? IIRC FPE can go like 4 different versions of crit/swift
FPE is good, got a friend who mains it just fine. He competes with my barrage alt at similar ilvl for damage, his char has better quality, ilvl and gems than my alt and pulls ahead unless he fucks up or has to do a mechanic. It's much better at doing boss mechanics than barrage because the main spells have higher stagger and it runs more swift so lower cooldowns, plus the faster movespeed gets him around. It's a very well rounded build.
You will get invited on any well geared class if everything else is good on your roster. Its not your class that is getting you gatekept, its your roster level, gems, lack of titles, no cards. Plenty of people apply to parties with all of those checked. I have a 1475 FP arty that will pretty much get insta invites to anything besides clown and does great damage for his level with only 1 level 7 gem, he just got rid of a level 2 this week. Once he is 1490 I have no doubt he will get invited to clown on reset day (more gatekeeping earlier in the week) and any Brel 1-2 once he has 5-6 level 7 gems which is when I will push him to her.   I see pistol deadeyes, depression hunters, scouters, reapers, reflux sorc, combat readiness in my Brels quite often, play what you enjoy/can afford. A lot of players also like the 'rare' classes because it shows you enjoy the class are not some reddit meta andy who couldn't get cruel fighter as a BE with a pocket bard.  And dont worry about trying to get all those Roster boxes checked immediately, just try to slowly work on your roster and grow at your own pace. I recommend trying to funnel gems, getting most gems 7 will get you ez invites to Valtan and Vykas even if you haven't tightened up the rest. GL fellow Gunner enjoyer, keep going and there wont be any gate you wont be able to blast through.
like many already said, first of all play what you like.  &#x200B;  2ndly FPE isn't bottom. It's average dps comparing to good player with spec class. You will def be able to out dps a bad ignitor or arcana. I never get gatekept because I am FPE. Actually it's easier to get into party than a random ignitor because FPE is swift, has shield/tanky and good stagger (I cleared brel 5-6 on fpe arti alt before my ignitor main because every party has a big ignitor already)
Reddit: pick whatever is fun for you  Game: pick barrage noob
FE is just middle of the pack damage and is not bad with some of the best stagger available but is very tripod dependent so you will be behind on damage until you can start farming lvl 5 tripods at 1540 CD. Artillery is also not very popular as a class so honestly u have a lower chance at being gatekeeped because ur not competing with popular classes for a spot. DI SH is the worst dps in the game and still gets groups. Also, there is a dps shortage rn so its easy to get raids lol
Is firepower weaker? Yes.  Will you be gatekept out of some groups because people perceive it as weaker? Yes.  However, firepower is much, MUCH cheaper. You can build firepower much sooner and start clearing raids much sooner.
FPE is bad compared to BE, but building proper FPE costs fraction of BE.   Having played both FPE and BE, playing the meta FPE of crit main stat, swiftness secondary feels pretty much the same as playing BE, but without the damage.   With BE your one rotation of skills generates your wheelchair (assuming everything lands), then you do the wheelchair rotation and then again human form rotation   FPE feels just as clunky as BE, but no upside in damage. Only if you go full swiftness variant of FPE it feels smooth to play, but it is also the weakest FPE build, pretty much only good for Prokel
FPE is a decent spec.  Barrage peaks early since it's one of those classes that gets a massive benefit from one big gem (like surge and master summoner), but FPE catches up when you start moving into 9's and 10's across the board.  You also have more mobility, stagger and weak point. FPE is one of those classes that can make up for a bad party stagger comp with Napalm shot and massive stagger on multirocket launcher  In the end, play the spec you like the most. I play barrage myself, it's a very good, tanky, easy to play spec and does a lot of damage very easily. FPE does too, but it needs more gems to do so.
Just play what you want. FPE has good stagger but the damage is really like bad.
HAHAHAHAHA! FPE Artillerist are one of the better stagger class. It also have -%Defense. If everyone plays an Igniter Sorc or Master Summoner just for damage, and most of them are clueless about playing said class, they are more likely gatekept due to stigma and only those known players who mains them and plays them well will be invited. Seriously, just play what you like and do your utmost best.
barrage is double the dps of firepower and this will never change. if you wanna play firepower even after knowing this go for it
I've played both FPE and BR builds, both are fun.  Recently switched back to FPE and plan on staying there for a bit.  Barrage carried it's weight early in the game as well as doing chaos runs, but FE is more forgiving as being mobile in legion raids pre and post-Valtan is pretty important.  Yeah, damage is something left to be desired but having fun/surviving fights is also good.  Artys are nice comfort picks for most groups so gatekeeping 'should' be minimal..
First of all: I play barrage, used to play FPE.  You wont compete with barrage on damage alone on most fights, but that's fine.  FPE is extremely safe hitmaster DPS which is easy to play, insane stagger (Napalm), good counter (Swing).    As a class that contributes a lot to mechs while also being very easy to play, I'm happy to take PUG FPE into runs for stagger and survivability.  For the same reasons you would take a Gunlancer or Destroyer, Stagger becomes more and more useful as the game goes on.
no one will gatekept any build as long as it is BiS build with perfect 5x3 engraving, lv7 gems, 50+ quality, at least for myself, heck l will even accept Pistoleer at this point
Absolutely not. FPE is very strong and cheap. I play an offmeta build with hallucinations and mass increase and MVP all the time. He is comparable to any other class I play from zerker to glavier and in some fights  he clearly outperforms them. Tier list need context and I guarantee any tier list you've seen wasn't created for "NA/EU PUG LOBBIES".  Edit: I have, multiple times , beat similarly geared barrage enhancement Arty's, for whatever reason. Our consistency is better and we don't whiff as bad.
If it's around the middle I don't mind, but people told me it's around the bottom chart and people will gatekeep me. I already get gatekeep on my machinist and sharpshooter and it is frustrating, so I don't want to face the same issue with a main. If it's only around 15% diff it's not that bad.  Thank you for your advice :)
I didn't see anyone above that item level, all I saw were barrage ones lol I play EUC
But what about the two main damage attacks of the missiles to land? Some bosses move, change locations, each attack takes few seconds...
FPE is more consistent. As in, consistently lower.  Barrage takes more damage but by no means is squishy. It's well above average in tankiness comparing across classes.  The higher stagger that FPE has is definitely a real advantage at least.
Thanks for help  I read the guide shared on this subreddit I think crit and swift, my gear is poem of salvation
Right but your two main damage attacks the landing bombs take a few seconds to land, boss can move, run, change location and you miss DPS.
Yes loll
I don't have a guild to run with or something and IDK I keep on getting gatekept on my alt machinist and sharpshooter so... Thanks for advices
I play on sharpshooter and machinist too and people gatekeeper me, I have to pray hour and pray for a miracle lol, so it is very frustrating and don't want the same experience with my altilerist gg
That's the problem. It has insane stagger, a good weak point, and also shield. But the damage of FPE is very very bad. I don't want to get gatekeep like my sharpshooter and machinist
The OP is trying to have a serious discussion.  You’re getting downvoted because you gave a wildly hyperbolic blind-metaslave response.  To the original post: the two builds aren’t that far apart in damage, with BE coming out ahead given equal gem levels.  That’s part of the issue though: one L10 barrage damage gem is huge ROI for that spec, whereas FPE needs a ton of gem investment across dmg/cooldown on a bunch of skills to scale its damage.  FPE has solid stagger, mobility, better general smoothness of play, and is more forgiving to mistakes or crappy boss movement/patterns.  You’re also not going to be stuck in your turret when a counter opportunity comes up.  I’ve used both and I stuck with FPE.  Just more fun to play for me.  And any lobby host that isn’t a derp is going to know what you bring to the raid.  My arty has L7 gems; I get invited to PF lobbies almost as fast as my gunlancer.
Yes, for a noob like me I guess it would be easier for me to survive bosses, I know Artillerists are nice because of their insane  stagger, but I think FPE are rare and people will put you as second option
Idk who you been talking to but FPE Artis do not get gatekept. They provide a lot to parties outside of damage.
What build are you running on your SS cuz after the changes you really shouldnt be gatekept
I play barrage and a friend of mine play firepower, it isnt incomum that the only thing i can really do is damage, and he can do a good amount of damage,stagger and he can have a bit better weakpoint then me, i would not say that firepower have bad damage but the guys who say to you are just bad, it isnt incomum for him to get cruelfighter on yours brel runs
One of my alts is FPE artillerist and I rarely get gatekept. People love them mainly because of staggering. Can you take a screenshot of your build so we can see what may need to be done?
There’s 4 main damage attacks, the multiple rocket and heatbomb also does significant damage. Those two with the two bombs do the bulk of the damage. It’s really hard to miss all four.   But yeah, bosses move and stuff, but if a boss moves during FPE, you can still chase it and use your other abilities. A boss moves during barrage, well now it’s wasted and you need to rebuild your meter. Barrage is high risk high reward.
Being squishy isnt really the issue, it’s building meter that’s the real problem for “bad” barrage players because now you’re affecting everyone else’s damage. And there’s some mechs that even as barrage you shouldn’t be tanking. All of this leads to wasted turret rotations and a huge dps loss, and where an fpe player can over take because missing a couple shots as an FPE isn’t that big of a deal.   I mean don’t get me wrong, a barrage players who knows boss patterns and positioning can easily be mvp and an fpe player can never compete with a competent barrage player.
I think guide has nightmare for crit/swift as standard and hallu for full swift.
Your gear should be nightmare.
Same for barrage, it needs to land those bombs if it wants to transform in one rotation, else it needs to wait on cooldowns to do it. And the turret form abilities have their limits as well. FPE actually has an advantage when it comes to burst window over barrage because of how short their rotation is, whereas barrage takes a while (ofc can be shortened with as buffs). So if damage windows are short, FPE may be able to pull ahead on an even playingfield.
Machinist and ss alts oof. Hope your roster is high
Gatekeeping will drain your mental on a weekly basis.  take my advice and at least have 1 of the op class in Lost ark or start investing in a barrage arty.
For weaker specs you hone higher to get accepted to groups easier, 1460 Valtan, 1475 Vykas, 1490 Clown
Why do you think that FPE's dmg is very bad? It's about 10-15% DPS difference. I play a FPE artillerist thats 1540 ilvl with all 90%+ quality accs and I get MVP often.   Though I don't get highlighted dmg but highlighted in other categories such as staggering, still a MVP nonetheless. FPE artillerist is more than fine in any raid lobbies.
you may not have noticed but i didnt say anything about getting gatekept, stagger, counter, being more fun, mobility or anything you just listed to cope with yourself. i just said whats true which is barrage is double the dps of fpe and anyone thats not coping with their "better mobility better stagger blabla" knows this
I don't know...
Loyal companion before patch, after patch I get gatekept less.
Yes, but it is hard to land an attack because some bosses move fast or Change location, therefore nuke attacks miss probably, no?
Uncommon? I think that's the word you krangled.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malapropism  Everyone probably has an expression or word ^^  English is a silly language anyhow!
My FPE altilerist is not the greatest, as I started investing and deciding to go in that direction ( I still got some barrage equips) I wanted to make sure I won't get gatekeep because of it...
Oh right. With the shooting laser, it's harder to change the direction
Right, and probably most players don't play their class on maximum potential.
If arty is your main class, FPE can be much nicer for prog raiding and learning fights since you're not glued to a wheelchair while you're still learning patterns and mechs.
Yes, but I already crafted everything and transferred the item level to it, I can't destroy them for the materials
Right. Because I played after what I love, as I read advice of people who told you to do so. I deleted my sorceres and berserker for them.
Right, but I tried Sorceres and Berserker they are boring and hard to play for me... I already made high-level machinist and sharpshooter alts, I don't want to start over with new alts.
I don't know. I talked to high-level artillerists in the game and they said FPE is very bad I also searched the DPS chart and also it seems like FPE is not popular so I thought...
the difference is way bigger than that, its only 15% if you compare fpes strongest with barrages weakest build.
“Double” DPS where? On a static dummy in trixion with L10 barrage vs L5 FP gems?  Or are you referencing a cherry picked number from an artificial/theoretical DPS chart from KR?
Firepower isn’t bottom of the list. It’s a B tier class. Perfectly balanced. Not broken, but not terrible
Swiftness i assume, pretty good but if youre gonna rebuild id recommend giving the 50/50 crit spec variant a look as its currently the strongest build dealing real competitive dmg
Barrage has the same nukes and they need to hit their nukes to get enough meter to transform.  It's a "git gud" type of deal. You need to learn boss patterns and when to drop nukes. My FPE Arty is like 1505 now. Damage is "acceptable," solidly middle of the pack. Barrage does better damage, but barrage is stupid good so it's hard to compare against. FPE is way nicer for learning fights.
You use those same nukes in barrage.  You also have times where you start firing lasers and boss jumps behind you or off screen.
Yeah i did mean uncommum, english isnt my native language, i thinked in english but typed on portuguese
The higher you go the more stagger becomes a thing, iirc fpe has stagger tripode  People will love you for it. Damage is rarely , if ever, an issue  But stagger can and will be  Don't be discouraged. You'll be loved for who you are
You don't destroy and recraft. You use gear conversion to switch them for free. You unlock gear conversion by farming 55 valtan bones and 55 vykas wings total, so you should be extremely close if you don't already have it. Open your character panel and you should see a "gear set conversion" button underneath your character's feet. There you can freely swap to any other gear set. Many of my characters use a different gear set for chaos dungeons than they do for raiding.
I also have machines as an alt you will face gatekeeping a lot in that class. SS is a high skill class they also face gatekeeping.   FP arty is weaker than the barrage arty and a majority of players know that so when they see FP arty they will think twice and see the other people who applied before they pick you.  The only solution is to be overgeared for the content you want to play, 5x3 build, or have lvl7 or above gems and all that cost insane money.  Unfortunately that is the state of the game rn.
If your build is good don't worry about it. The gate keeping is largely about roster and how well you are built. I've got a buddy the mains fp and the fella has zero issues getting into groups. It's not like a reaper or transformation class - those guys do face some issues.
Probably the old artillerist players who didn't even bother to read the balance patch, let alone playing them since they already had barrage builds to begin with so they had no reasons to play FPE other than dissing them.  Just so you know, 5 of my DPS class in my top 6 roster are all "off meta" builds which are:  * LC Swift SS * FPE Artillerist * Eso Striker * Legacy Scouter * Red Crit/Swift GL   And they get in lobbies just fine and they all do the job well so I don't know why you're worried about it. Just play what you like. ;)
im solely talking on my experience and, the trixion dummy, cherry picked dps charts interestingly say they are somewhat close in dmg but i guess its because every consistent dps class is 10x inflated on trixion parses. fpe cant even outdps barrage with 10x inflated dps on trixion damn
The 50/50 crit/spec build is about 3-4% DPS more comparing the full LC swift build, is it not? I personally don't think he need to switch the build if he already invested on high quality accessories.
So what's the solution? I guess I will form parties of my own and take all the classes which are gatekept. Hope more people will do that 😄
The problem is my roster is below level 100
Probably because I'm not pro as you. My roster is below level 100, i'm still trying to figure out things about the game, etc... But IDK that's my experience and other players from certain classes 😅
I actually never did a swift parse post patch ill do one  and compare, all i know is the 5050 build was 20-25% increase over pre patch swift with a couple lvl 4 tripods
like you said make you own parties but you will face reverse gatekeeping![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy) the strong players might not join your party and have a lot of min Ilvl players with maybe good build. find a guildmates who can help but that also hard.  my advise have at least 1 OP class as an alt or invest in a Barrage arty.
5x3 fpe isn’t expensive.  If you’re 5x3 with correct stats, at least lvl5 gems, and more than 20 above the content, can’t see getting gatekept just bc FPE.
1.	No 2.	+20 everything EXCEPT SHOULDERS 3.	Do Brel 1/2 4.	Transfer +19 shoulders to Brel 5.	optional: hone Brel shoulders to reach 1500 if you want
1. Yes and no. Kakul gives Mayhem horns, which will make your gear lvl2, increases its benefits. Now, you can skip this and try to join brel, but having lvl1 gear might be a turn off for a lot of people, hence being harder to get a group. 2. I recommend honing everything to 20. If youd like, you can hone something like your chest or legs to 19, and hone gloves to 21. After 1000s of hones, your rng is all going to work out at the same regardless of the path you take.   Good luck!
Do not listen to people saying that getting into Brel groups without level 2 set will be a problem. Source: me, who has had 3 straight characters go straight from 1472.5 to 1490 to do Brel for a couple weeks so I could then hone to 1500 and \*then\* start doing clown for level 2 set.  Getting into clown groups under 1500 is 100% more difficult than getting into Brel 1-2 groups at 1490. Plus going back to clown at 1500 makes that fight far less punishing.  Edit: What will make getting into Brel 1-2 groups difficult is not having 5x3 and not having level 7 gems so I would focus on those elements first.
Yeah, you could definitely learn both raids in a week, would just take a lot of time. You don't need the clown horns, but you might have troubles finding parties. Since you're focusing on getting a 5x3, I would first get clown down, since the bar of entry is lower. After you finish your upgrades, with all the bounds you have stored up, start pushing everything to Brel NM (Everything should be around +20)
Before you hone to +20, use an upgrade calculator (like the one on Maxroll) to see if it is cost-efficient to buy the Brel honing books (Advanced Mending) from AH. The Brel armor honing books stop at +20 and since your armor pieces are at +19, make as well use them if it is cost-effective. You can always come back later for Clown after getting Brel gear since Elgacia is a long time away.
I neglected Alts prior to brel. In the last month I’ve pushed 3 characters from 1475 to 1500+  As others have said, clown before 1500 is brutal, even if you’ve been running it on a main. Even 1500 groups are going to see some mechs. Not the worst thing but being 1500+ makes it much more forgiving. You’ll get denied on brel runs due to ilvl well before they ever check to see if you have lvl 2 bonus from clown.   I’m just starting to unlock the 4pc clown bonus on those 3 Alts and the dmg increase is huge. Makes everything much easier.   Imho def get to 1500 first.
Hone everything to +20 and gloves to +21. Your weapon is already +21.  Do brel g1-g2, transfer glove to brelic and hone 1 more on it for 1500.  Since you probably have lots of prebrel mats and not much marvelous leaps, imo this would be the best course for you.  At 1500 you can start learning Kakul a bit easier too.
Extremely hard to get into brel groups unless you're 5x3. Will be an even bigger struggle with no lvl 2. I would say work on that and do clowns. With that said brel 1/2 is much easier to learn and do than clown.  Just be aware that gatekeeping has become the norm so you should try to join/create learning parties.
Follow what other people suggests, but I recommend you to take time and learn the raid properly instead of taking a bus or sneaking into reclear party, which will probably tempt you. It will be damn hard to find learning party, but there will always be one popping up eventually. Take your time and learn the raid with others through learning party, and it will make you better player overall. Skipping those learning process will just make you someone who always get carried.
Uaaaa
Thank you for the steps, helps a lot! will do these
Adding to this  I ran a gs on lvl 1 set in brel for 1.5months (as a social experiment, mostly on or near ilvl)  Never had anyone mention it ever
Just adding to the other guys; I pushed 3 alts to Brel at once last week and have had 0 issues with lvl 1 set :^)
Thank you so  much! I was curious about the experience as checking gear of people in partyfinder could've been misleading as they could be friends and whatnot.    Will do and learn Kakul regardless, but wanted to know if it was even worth applying at all at that in-between point.
Aside from week 1 pugs, I never saw anyone check set level
I mean... You could have 0 issues with 0 gems too. Or 3 engravings. A dumb thing to say.
Good stuff!!
Thanks guys!
That’s not quite how it works…? Not having any gems or having a 3x3 instead of 5x3 is a huge dps difference, while lvl 2 clown set is a minimal upgrade that no one bothers to check. I personally have never accepted anyone without checking their engraving and gems at the minimum.
Again chiming in  Much easier to get into brel with set lvl 1 compared to clown below 1490  Worst case for brel bus is 4k gold and you get 4k from clearing the raid so that's also an option
I'm saying that it is a dps increase and then you can apply that logic to everything.
It is, but some dps increases are substantially better than others. Not having any gems will literally break a class, while not having lvl 2 set will mean your 3.5 mill skill will do 3.2 mill instead. That’s why I don’t think you can apply something as broad as “a dps increase” when talking about gatekeeping without specifying what the increase is.
Anyone who plays gs and says it doesn’t do damage is just bad at the class.  It is very strong if you’re good at it.
Not even close...  Also arti was never low DPS.
1500 crit 800 spec 7m peacemaker 1 adr 2 grudge hit master cursed doll keen blunt. this build outdps every class that is not a broken bursty char(barrage, igniter, master sum, surge, rage hammer, deathblow etc)
GS is considered busted in KR right now (same balance patch as ours). Their endgame content is a little more hit master friendly than ours (or rather, less back attack friendly than ours), but GS is not weak.       GS is middle of the pack in theoretical damage (but lower end in trixion especially due to extra damage <50%), but it's a relatively easy class to achieve said theoretical damage.        If you feel like you're doing less damage than others, there's a few potential causes.         **First may just be the group you play with** - the more we overgear content, the more the meta favors burst classes (e.g., igniter, barrage, deathblow). They blow up a big part of the dps pie, then everyone needs to cut damage (e.g., G3 clown show time, G6 brel meteor/tile management, etc.), limiting consistent dps class perforamance.        **Second may be stat distribution** - with LWC (200 crit stat value) and AD3, your optimal crit without a crit synergy in your static should be around 1250. Even as low as 1100 if you have a 10% crit in your static (or even lower with swift wd, control glaive, or other 18% crit high swift classes). Spec/swift distribution doesn't make a big difference given your gem levels, but rest in spec is better for overgeared content for more burst.        **Third,** given your roster level, you are probably missing a few **skill points** (and maybe tripods?). GS is *very* skill point intensive. Also, if you have anything less than full skillpoints right now, 7M crit/spec build that you appear to be running (I'm guessing based on your setup) is very inefficient. Our 408 sp cap is already below the minimum sp typically recommended for 7M skill rotation in KR (switch is recommended around 412+ with level 8+ cds), and if you're missing more sp from that cap, go 6M nightmare with 500 swift until you get those sp (and better cd gems).       **Point 3.5 (edit):** switching to nightmare alone should also just give you a meaningful damage bump by itself at your weapon quality levels as long as you eat mana food when you do.  **Fourth,** (and relatedly) all 7s with one 8 gem is probably close to the bare minimum gems for someone in your ilvl zone. Most dps with level 9s or more should and will substantially outdamage you. 7M build also functions suboptimally with 7s.        **Lastly,** 33333 with your engravings is about 3~4% weaker than the 333321 PM1 build. This means your dps ceiling at 1550 (all +16) should be about the same as 1540 (all +15) with 333321 build.        Edit 2: minor adjustments on the crit stat comment because I can't do simple multiplication.
I started to stop caring about dps tierlist and more so on enjoyment . These tier list are just plain stupid and ruining the peoples enjoyment of the game . I get it you wanna see big dmg but we are months maybe a year behind where KR is to see big numbers
skill issue
No mention of tripods? Wep quality?  Lack of LWC, mid gems.  Honestly the whole vibe seems like unskilled pilot more than anything else.   I have 2 gs mains and another 3 with gs alts in my static. All agree gs is very strong and anytime someone says smoge dmg, it's just mediocre player.
The GS I play with in my static are usually cruel fighter and MVP. I'd say they're solid A tier DPS because their DPS uptime is so high.   Are you playing crit/spec build?
What's your DPS up-time like? Do you get knocked down often?       Chances are, if you feel like you perform better on your significantly lower ilvl Artillerist, you're used to standing in attacks that would otherwise knock you down on your GS.           GS is definitely not a bad DPS, far from it. But positioning is very important because a lot of skills root you down for a pretty significant amount of time. And you'll have to stay on top of your cooldowns which requires practice since you can't see whether skills have come off cooldown on sniper/shotgun if you're not in the respective stance.          I recommend to just pay as much attention as you can to boss patterns, memorize DPS windows and just get more practice in.
20 weapon? Gems? I believe those make a big difference for any character
Sorry it’s you and not the class.  GS is very strong in the right hands. Prob a main switch angle tbh.  Edit: before I get downvoted by snowflakes, the guy said he mained gs for a year. If you are still bad at the class after 1 year I don’t know what to tell you.  I’ve mained SS since launch and mvp 95-99% of the time and have been since the class has been considered bad and in a worse spot than it is now. It definitely wasn’t as good as gs and it still isn’t if played at its peak. I still did fine however with one of the least played/low dps classes.  Hell, even now all 6 of my SS are DS which is shit talked constantly right now and considered bad. The engraving for it right now on my server are 50-100g. This should tell you much about my class. Despite that I mvp all gates on all raids except maybe a few g1 brel just because it’s a trixion fight and ss isn’t great there no matter how well I play.   So before you downvote think on what you could improve to play better. Are you getting interrupted/knocked down. Are you not getting enough uptime? Do you know all immunity phases of the boss and when to do your rotation or maybe hold when the boss takes reduced dmg? Are you doing the optimal rotation? Can you improve your gems or maybe get higher weapon quality? You always want to be doing something and not just standing and waiting for cd, use auto attacks or reposition. Try to predict boss movement and space yourself accordingly. Using your spacebar aggressively to maximize dmg can be useful. These are some things you could be doing to improve, it’s been proven that gs is very good so once again it is definitely a you issue and you might want to do a bit more research on your class.
GS are still one of the highest dps classes.  It’s pretty rare I don’t get cruel fighter on mine even vs people with more i lev than me.
I know your edit says you know boss patterns don't get knocked down and use your abilities correctly but if this was the case you would be MVP most of the time even in juicer lobbies.  GS is absolutely not a weak class.
Maybe you’re playing properly? Most PM GSs I’ve played with do pretty well.
I top dps easily with my Crit spec GS 1540. Just today i've beat +20 weapon, 9 gems in 1-4 brel. I have +16 and 7 gems.
Funny that you say this today, yesterday i was outdamaging a 1520 blade with my 1503 gs on kakul xd
Stadt using skills instead of basic attacks.
I find that most gs I meet now is pretty good in dmg, appear quite often in the mvp screen. It was different before tho, seem like people get used to the class and play it better? idk. ur roster is still low, so I assume u need more time with the class
Gunslinger is view in Korea as the "broken limit" Meaning every class doing better than GS is considered a really good class,every other are average.  Gunslinger got a huge buff recently (yes, huge one) on her snipe skills. Like perfect shot only needing 3 shot and now you have more damage before 50% of the boss' HP.  Gunslinger is a consistent damage class. So your uptime is very important. Meaning for every spell up you lose DPS. Ofc you can't compare to burst class like artillerist.  It's like "hey guys I don't understand why my sorceress feels like she beat my mayhem zerker DPS wise" well no shit Sherlock ! Burst class will always feel stronger than consistent class, doesn't mean they are better.  In conclusion : what you fell and what really happens is two different things. But your build mean nothing with a good uptime on gun and if you lose your salvation buff during encounter you are losing so much DPS. Overall don't blame the class when it is obviously your current way of playing it the problem (or your brain who can't grasp the idea of how DPS work)
Try gs in hell content to see if ur truly unskilled or not tbh  Should be minimum upright fighter  Cant really say much if u dont have gameplay vids
Skill issue. We GS just got a major buff with the last balance patch on focus shot.
Couple of things, first off I'm assuming you're playing 7m with br, ps, and cata or srf. If you're not, then that is the build that is seeing solid performance and 6m is a lower ceiling for higher comfort.   > I'm always dsping during the fight never go into full cd because I can manage my stances cds  With level 7s, a salvation 7m gs should hit some downtime if you're rotating properly. This is probably one of the bigger issues   Are your tripods maxed? What about your skill points? These are both very important for gs because you have so many damage skills. If you don't have all the skill points by now, start to focus on them, they help a lot. Tripods can be gotten over time if you're sitting on 4s, but should prioritize getting 4s at the very least and 5s ideally on your big el4 skills.
>alt arti ilv 1495 deals double the dmg that my main gs  Artillerist is broken, but not *that* broken. You must be in very specific content for this to occur and even then with an iLVL gap it should never happen.
Player skill > classes in terms of DPS.
gs is a high investment class.  i started to get MVP against same or higher ilvl players 1560+,after upgrading my weapon to 20 and lvl 9+ gems.  make sure ALL your tripods are maxed.  some classes are just stronger than others in early/late game,thats why you feel that way.  GS is definitely considered as top tier dps in late game,but not strong as full spec classes like DB,Arti,etc.
Skill issue
Skill issue
I main both eng GS's and I'd say 60 to 70% of the time, I'm MVP across all content. But then again, I'm still watching videos, learning from better players and perfecting my rotation. I've been through a lot since making one and the muscle memory has kicked in to the point my fingers know exactly what comes next and how to react.
I will say you’re just doing something wrong, I have 3 gunslingers since launch and they were quite bad during Argos days, we have been getting nothing but straight buffs for 4 patches, we are borderline OP. What ever content I do, guardian raids, clown I end up doing upright / cruel a lot of the times. Perhaps your rotation is off? But we are a bursty uptime class, we have decent burst but content damage all the time, after the first rotation your always doing two abilities per cycle. Do you mind doing a 1 minute trixion with no awakening rotation to see your dps? If you could update me we can then see what else it can be.
Record gameplay or we can’t help
both GS builds are in a great spot rn
It's pretty middle of the pack for most farm content. For progging it's very good because it's consistent and doesn't have any specific timing issues like most other classes.   If you are seeing low damage, if there isn't a really strong class like igniter sorc or something else that just bursts all the boss' HP all at once, that's a performance issue on your part. You mentioned you never go into full CD, not sure what you mean on that but, every good gunslinger will run into an issue where they are waiting 3-6 seconds for their skills to come off of cooldown. I end up using all of my pistol skills during downtime and even auto-attacking sometimes.  To address your arti doing more damage than your GS, that's not really out of the question, Barrage Arti is one of the hardest hitters currently, so it is possible. A GS and a Barrage Arti that is similar geared and similar skillwise, the GS will never out dps the Arti, that's just how it is.
Tbh you don't even need to be good gs is quite easy compared to alot of other classes to reach skill ceiling with.
I'm going to respond to this so I can find the post later when I'm home and Playing the game
I don’t remember reading breakpoints for gems in the community guide. What level gems do you think would be a solid point. My gs is an alt but she’s been blessed with high quality weapon and armor so putting some resources into her. Super fun class. Running nightmare as I noticed the dmg is better (91 quality weapon) currently lvl 7 gems, 4x3x2x1 (meta pm 1 build) lvl 5 tripods, max avail skill points for 7m build on US servers. my crit is on the lower end because I’m saving for a better neck. Any input would be most appreciated.
I'm more used to my gs than my arti i just started playing arti maybe a month ago but my gs i have been playing for a year, I don't stand in the attacks at all I always avoid all I can even do all endgame dungeons with bad sup or no sup at all  and you can see if your shotgun and sniper skills are out of cd or not even if you are not in that stance by the small dots under each stance
weapon 16 gems all 7s and one 8, but my point is other classes at my ilevel still do more dmg than me, ofcourse if i have 20 weap and 10s gems i will do more dmg
that's a hot take if i ever heard one, unless you're talking about tth
Ahh I didn't know about the cooldowns bit.       It does sound like you have plenty of experience then, but it's still tough to give you advice without seeing any actual gameplay footage.
At 1550 if you play in a party like brel most around your level will have around 20 weapon and that plus other factors as who is the synergy and support on your team impacts it.  My main is a des over 1560 with 20 weapon and I notice even from 19 to 20 on a des it made a big difference so on purpose dps class it would be more. That 2 alt SF and Scapper at 1540 have 16 weapon 7 gem, and they place really depending on who is in my party. Usually making it on to family photo is good enough for me with them since most in my party are better geared.   So your case no LOS 18/30, 16 weapon and 7 gem is average - pretty sure you just partied with better geared people. I wouldn't go out and say you are bad. Just my thoughts.
unfortunately, I never record any gameplay 😞
thnx, for your thoughts, I'm still thinking that my low dps is still due to no los 18 and maybe 7s gems too because 7s is average, but I was aking ppl about their opinion about the class and got everyone calling me just bad 😅
Ahh that's unfortunate, it'd be the easiest way to give advice.       I do hope you manage to figure out what the issue is though!
I feel your pain. I went through a lot of those thoughts too but then looking into it more there is so much more that goes into it. As mentioned about weapon level, quality and gems are what you can control but support and Synerergy you can't and they play a big part in it. I got my LoS 18 and actually uses my selection for it since I know I'm not getting 30 any time soon. But LOS 18 at your ilvl will help and also your alts.  Now if you play in one of those 1490 plus vykas/valtan and at 1550 get put played by someone around 1500 then I would worry! Other then that you will see as you get closer to 20 weapon and better gems with LOS 18 it will be world or difference 😉
at vykas and clown I'm usually an upright or cruel fighter, but the problem always with berl or calligaos, I never make it to the mvp screen, well I'm trying to get los, 8s gems and better weap quality and let's see, 😅 I love the class and love how agile it is but it's disappointing to see other classes at the same ilevel deal so much dmg than you
It's not the class, gunslinger is very strong. And if it's pugs, then class doesn't matter because people's uptime is so poor. I always got MVP on pistoleer before I switched to Enhanced Weapon and that class was bottom 3 DPS  I'm not saying you're a bad player, but it's definitely not the class. It could be tripods, wrong build or wrong rotation. It could even be that you didn't farm skill points because gunslinger uses a lot of skill points.
I recommend getting your weapon to +20 first before getting gems, and when you do start investing in gems try to get level 9 damage ones first on your hardest hitting skills
Kadan/Zinnervale/Thirain
Can't go wrong with thiraine, kadan, zinnervale. Avoid asta.
Probably Kadan
Go on the lost ark discord and see which servers  chat seems the most active in, say guild recruitment, as well as the correct language.

So I was at 3 awakening level and had +4 cards. Tried to awaken it to level 4. After awakening I got a new Xereon with 1 awakened and now I had +3 cards left. I awakened again, it's now 2 awakened and I have +1 card left. They act like 2 different cards.  I noticed some cards shows 0 awaken when hovering over them and some don't. Not sure what's wrong here.
it's been like this for a while, don't worry about it  card awakening has always been buggy when you hover over it
But it's not just visual. It starts awakening from 0...
It's not gone , just looks like it, don't worry.  If you close window down and reopen card menu it'll show you the awaken version
Spec classes want AS MUCH spec as you can manage. I’d say aim for minimum 1700, with 1800 being near the max and requiring perfect accessory qualities
There's no min spec breakpoint for surge db. Higher gives more dmg on surge, I'd personally never go to less than 90 quality items with exception on class ring to make it some 60k cheaper :)
There aren't any significant breakpoints for spec on a Surge DB. You just want as much spec as possible. 9 spec is about 1% increase in Surge damage. So the difference between running a low 1700 or less spec versus running a close to perfect 1800 spec can be more than 10% difference in Surge damage.
1700+ with bracelet   No specific breakpoints needed
For pure damage Cursed Doll is slightly better, you need crit synergy in your party for KBW to pull the same weight. KBW is not bad at all I wouldn't worry about it if I were you.
Im doing fine on my surge db with 1706 spec  Smoother rotation is more dependent on gems  That being said, u can have a "perfect" rotation with lvl 5 cd gems
Correct answer: “Just a little bit more”
Other people have answered for spec, but I'd like to point out that going KBW means you want a lot of crit rate so get a high quality necklace for max crit and spec.
1800
Pretty sure Surge has no minimum spec for breakpoint like Robust SF. So any but as much as possible.
FYI, the past tense of cut is cut, there is no cutted.
if its your main 1800+ and for main roster alts 1780+ shouldnt be difficult
All accessories with spec and sub crit
1900
[removed]
So I have a surge db that’s got a pretty poop spec necklace (460 spec, 490 crit), so the spec is only at around 1660. This includes the bracelet which gives it 60 crit and 60 spec but it does have circulate. Is the bracelet worth sacrificing to get 1700+ spec?
I like to reach 1750+ cos thats when Surge reaches 200%+ dmg but not at all needed just personal pref
if it's a main DB, spec should be 1785+ with relic bracelet. if it's a decent alt 1750 no more no less, if it's one of those trash alts anything above 1700
Yeah, that's what I'm trying to do right now I lost 6 spec on my class accessorie, what about crit because I got a necklace for very cheap, from spec I'm loosing only 2 points but from crit it's 25. Is that bad?
Class ring is generally the first item I purchase in a build simply because you can that much or more if shooting for a high quality.  A 3/5 spec ring can be wild on some classes . I try to shoot for 80+and stay 30-50k, takes a while of looking be willing to lose bids.  I have 3 1800+ spec characters and unless you’re willing to whale I don’t know another way to do it without dropping 100+ for a single piece.
1700 spec vs 1800 spec is like +~189% surge dmg vs +~200% surge dmg  The actual dmg difference is ~3.8% surge dmg  I did this math based on 9 spec = 1% surge dmg as i cannot check ingame rn
Thank you
Or if you dislike cursed doll healing down just go with KBW
Ahahaha 😄

Personally I would invest in a new necklace.
It's fine, 80+ neck should be okayish :)
I'd wait it out a bit. Db surge accessories are expensive as hell. A bunch of players might get lucky in the upcoming weeks with ancient drops. You then have some more options on auction house.
You are correct, but i wasn't trying to say that it was an overall 10+% damage increase on Surge, but a difference of 10+% damage on Surge between the two specs levels, like how you illustrated with the 189% vs 200% which is a 11% difference. I probably could have worded it better, sorry for the confusion.
You dont have a breakpoint for robust. The more spec you have the faster your hype will recover.
So let’s say I get a new necklace but spec is still like 1690 (nice) is that still worth keeping the bracelet?
Ohhh he said there is no breakpoint like robust spirit my bad
I have 1706 spec with a circulate bracelet and i mvp 95% of the time  Its perfectly fine imo, but it does look pretty bad to be sub 1700 spec with bracelet  Waste of pheons to upgrade accs/bracelet if ur build works fine imo
Circulate just makes it very hard to replace. If you're only at slightly under 1700 with a 490 spec neck, then you should just upgrade other accessories instead. It sounds like your earrings could be upgraded too.          With 100 quality on every accessory, the max amount of spec you can have is somewhere around 1820ish (including cards/potions bonus from collectibles)        So you're def rocking some accessories worth upgrading still, which I'd go for before touching your bracelet.
I say this because of the rng factor of bracelet and you potentially spending 30 to 50k on a high stat bracelet and then getting unlucky on the rolls. I treat bracelets as bonus stats personally.  With accessories you can buy what you want if it is available so I tend to prioritize accessories. A low spec necklace you would want to replace eventually anyway and provides the most stats. Having cheaper engraving combinations on the necklace definitely helps with cost as well.
It's not your bad, its his bad? Idk about RS Soulfist but some classes have pretty significant breakpoints, especially transformation classes. He worded it like RS Soulfist is part of that group.
LWC applies a debuff on the boss, rather than a buff to the party which makes me believe it's multiplicative.
Multiplicative, in similar fashion to "I have a plan".   "I have a plan", dark support set 30, LWC30 in power spectrum for neutral ground (non weakness)
Robust Spirit or Energy Overflow for SF? what are yalls thoughts on both
trying to buyh the crafting recipe from Jeniff but it is telling me that I already have the Masterwork master herb steak meal recipe but it shows as amount owned 0?? Is this a bug??
For those who play entropy glavier at a high ilvl is adrenaline3 over cursed doll 3 viable? The extra crit really helps for horn crit chance but not sure if I’m sacrificing too much dmg.. full engravings are with grudge pinnacle and rc and am.
I can't seem to find it on my own. I saw a few days ago an image which displayed dps classes from best to worst of each type (entropy,hitmaster,both or smth). Does anyone knows where can I find it?
Are you supposed to start resting your chaos dungeons/guardian raids starting today, to get full rested for the Brel HM launch?  Is it necessary to rest una dailies for leapstones? Or are those still the same?
Just got back into the game recently after taking a break and I’m seeing a lot more ppl in raids use atrophine now is it better to just bring it if the gate lets you and your class can use it well to make runs go by faster?
My main is at 1445 and this may sound like a silly question. Until this point, I was only looking to get the engravings I wanted (according to maxroll), and not caring much about stat. At what point should I really be concerned with the stat, and more importantly, is there a systemic way of getting both engravings and stats right correctly? or is it really a chance of luck? For the past few days, I tried to get the stats correctly and by doing that, my engravings are all over the place (obviously). Thanks in advance.
Hi!  Will be there any achievement related to clearing brel G6 hard for those of us who don't have multiple 1560+ but can show we cleared at least once (For the second week). I only have main at that ilevel right now.  How is the state of Mayhem Zerker? Books are like 4K and I would need 14 more. Like 56K. But he still 1415 (5K leaps and 1.2M shards) and I have a solid roster of +6 1520 so don't know if it would be a waste to spend 60K on books + at least another 70 on accs.  Thanks.
TTH gunslingers, if I wanna go the Swift/spec necklace route (+spec on everything else), which gear set should I craft first? I've checked out the community guide and saw that NM, salv, and hallu are some of the recommendations, but I would appreciate more specific guidance. I'm aiming for a 4x3+2+1 (Grudge, TTH, KBW, HM, Adren2, PM1).   also would like to hear how much gold you guys spent on your builds. I know spec ain't cheap and those builds benefit from every single spec stat you can get. just wondering how much/how long I should save for all her accessories. (if it's anything like my deadeye I may have to save up/hone less for a couple more weeks haha)
I'm a relatively new player and managed to find a Master Craft Kit through excavation.  Is it worth it for me to craft a relic tool or should I just sell it? I could definitely use the gold and I'm afraid of rolling bad effects if I do end up using the kit.
What are the Gear Score check points for more Una Token`s?
as mayhem zerker which bracelet is better?  https://i.imgur.com/n5Zo9xK.png
Does the dmg and crit rate portion of Master Summoner engraving effect pets? Ancientspear/Earth collapse?
How effective are chaos dungeon builds? Is it worth it to build those on DPS?
Sorry if this has been asked, but could I get advice if I should start over or continue playing my old characters? Some information  * I moved to west coast, and all my friends stopped playing so I don't have a reason to stay on east coast beside my characters. * I don't pvp so staying on east coast servers probably isn't a problem. * My current roster is a holy knight (main/highest) at ilvl 1043. Berserker 513, and shadow hunter and gunlancer at 340. * If I were to restart on west coat, I would still main holy knight.  If I were to stick to my account what do you guys suggest I do? Is there a guide somewhere? Is the Punika power pass available (and how do I get it)?
 Can you enter Adventure island twice in one day? Specifically speaking about Asura island 2nd quest
Hello.  Still learning how to play support.  What are the best moments to use the Awakening during Gate 3 of kakul saydon? I'm usually casting the awakening shield right when he summon the mario portals.
I’m wanting to build a 3 spender WD but I’m wondering if there’s a difference in performance between that and the 4 spender. Should I think about moving up to 4 spender after reaching 3 spender or should I just stay with 3 spender when I reach that goal of mine?
I'm trying to make some gold selling oreha but don't have structures to reduce my crafting cost. Are there any structures I could buy/obtain atm that could reduce it? Should I find other structures to craft something else?
I Like big number. RS every time
For me Robust does consistently higher damage because the rotation is more controlled and static. However it is squishier and less comfy to play due to low swiftness and lower damage reduction uptime. It is also vastly more expensive because it’s a spec class that pretty much uses no cheap engravings. EO is strong too and very comfy but it also an uptime class that relies on high value hype 3 timings to do good damage which is far more volatile in actual raids. Eo is also cheap af to build.
If you know nothing about the class go EO. EO is easy to play, hard to master. IMO one of the hardest class to play well. RS will not feel good until you hit the spec breakpoint and even that can be spendy. Both do the same damage roughly.
the good thing is they both use the same exact skills and tripods so you can switch easily if you change your mind.   i like both playstyles, robust is more simple but the downtime sucks   energy overflow is faster like piano but hype management is a PITA if you're not comfortable with the raid
check under the other headings on the crafting window, farm, special ect........sometimes they are there
What's your stat spread? I'm running cd 3 with a ring and bracer for crit (along with entropy set)
It is somewhere on this reddit but all I can say is that list was wrong. It was based on simulated trixion numbers according to "perfect conditions" included inaccurate builds for certain classes, didn't include all classes/specs, etc.
Yes today should be resting. Although the value of 1540 chaos compared to 1520 isn't really that high to rest them if you're currently running them unrested. Ofc if you run them rested then doing it after patch would be better. This is the same with cali vs monkey.... But if you wanna gamba on small chance of ancient acce then go for it.   No point resting leaps you get the same mats.
Never necessary outside of inferno difficulty and on normal content it can be used to specifally help skip certain mechs, very common in clown to try and skip marios in g3, or maze in g2
It's never necessary, these people are just trying to parse/get mvp. Only bring it if you're 100% confident in the raid and you know that you won't need time stop.
Stats are more important than engravings. You need both to raid at endgame - at least 3 level 3 engravings for Valtan, 4 for Vykas, usually 5 for clown and above, all with correct stats.  You could get 3x3 with some luck, Argos accessories, and a 6/6 stone, but for anything above that or with relic accessories, you have to buy what you need from the auction house.
To add on to what others said, before you buy more things, be sure you're building properly as well. Not sure what class you are playing, but the community guide hub has a link to all the community guides which are more informative overall than maxroll (and better updated as of late): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1APWVyq77z2flMCc06_cqUnrNKee1U99p7R4XZe5FYV0/edit
Stats are more important than engraving. Some classes straight up can't function without correct stats. You can aim to do a 4x3 build to start with and upgrade to 5x3 at a later time. Also don't use maxroll guides, they are pretty outdated or poorly written. Look up community guides if there is one available for your class. There are also content creators who have made video class guides/in-depth walkthroughs.  You will mostly be buying accessories with the right stats and engraving from AH. It's very rare to get a piece dropped that you can use yourself. Start by deciding on your build, then cut a rock first. Then whatever is left will be filled by engraving books and accessories.
As others are saying you need both and the best way to find both is buying from the AH. What class are you? I might be able to help suggest finding inexpensive ways to build
You get a pet. KR occasionally have everyone gather in a stronghold to show pets
Mayhem is pretty good right now. Red Dust is still annoying with its lack of superarmor and the fact that it kills a skill rotation if the boss dodges it. And it's still pretty squishy, but no longer in a league of its own (Mayhem with Grudge now is roughly as tanky as Mayhem without Grudge used to be, around Gunslinger-tier). On the other hand, it has pretty good burst and sustained damage + great stagger and has less ani lock/usability issues than it used to.  I haven't seen/heard of any real gatekeeping for it after the patch, and it's generally regarded as top-tier out of the non-spec builds.
Nightmare and salvation are suggested for gunslingers with crit on their necklace. If you are going for swift/spec, hallucination or dominion fang should be used depending on what all your other accessories are. So in your case where you plan to have spec on everything else, hallucination would be better.
Hallu sucks until 6set so it's viable to build NM and then swap to Hallu when you get gear conversion. You'll be stuck at NM6 for a week or two, but it's not that much worse.  It's been quite a while since I built mine and I didn't go for insane quality, but I recall it actually not being very expensive. The biggest hangup is that a 7/7 rock makes it way cheaper than a 7/6 because it lets you run a 5/0 PM accessory instead of having to buy a 5/3.
Sell it. As a new player it's certainly more of a luxury item.
It's just a requirement, conversion is totally free.  If it used 55 of both mats every time it would be a lil insane :D
They're never consumed, you simply need to have **earned** 55 wings and 55 bones on that character. Even your first conversion doesn't cost anything. You also don't need to have the 55 of each in your storage, you can craft your set and the amount you spent on the set is still counted toward the total. It should take around 1 week (now that we have 2x resources for 5 clears) after you finish your set to get gear conversion.
For T3, 1302 -> 1415 -> 1490 -> 1580 (when Akkan releases)
Cool headed
It affects your identity and normal skills but not your pets. You take it at level 1 on CO for the lowered identity cost + bonuses to identity but it is terrible at level 3 for CO Summoners because pets are about half our damage and it doesn't work on pets (or awakening iirc).
As someone who has made chaos dungeon builds on every one of my characters, the ones that MASSIVELY impact their playstyle just from proper gearing has been Scouter and Artist, both having high tripod level in Annihilation Mode and Crane, combined with Dominion set makes their runs just a 1 button spam.  As for Bard and Paladin, with a proper setup, they cruise through Chaos atm. My Bard just has like 3 screen wide aoe clears and my Paladin just melts with low cd skills.  As long as you run Preemptive Strike and the right Relic set, you're good to go. Some classes may want their Class engraving for extra dmg, and supports might want Contender or Cursed Doll to help, but for more DPS, just having Preemptive Strike makes things smoother.
 It does depend on the class a bit. Some classes are completely fine just switching Preemptive Strike on them like Deathblade, Sorc etc.   Other classes like Wardancer (FI at least), Soulfist and Tai Scrapper really benefit from a proper chaos setup.             And it also obviously becomes more effective the more time you spend doing chaos dungeons. Personally I do them daily on 8 characters so making my clear time faster can add up quite well.
NAW is pretty bad with its BC price, AH prices, and you will see a lot of chinese players and RMT whales. I'd stick to NAE if you can bear with the ping.  Your characters are fairly low ilvl so you can totally just take a month off and play on NAW and see how things are.
Yes but if you’re talking about the quest then in for the island you cannot talk to the vendor again that day
Sounds like a good plan, Mario 3 is important to protect your guy on, going into M3 on low HP is pretty miserable if you have a bad pattern. Showtime is another possibility if your guys are on item level, and you want to save sidereal. You probably have to choose between M3/showtime, and M3 is a bit scarier in most cases.  Other than that, clown is in a weird spot where most of his attacks either give you mayhem, or they can't be tanked (saws, hooks, shit like that.)  You can use it if he gets off his deadly ball charge and is targetting a class (or clown) that can't escape.
Along with the other reply, awakening is good to get identity gauge if you need to heal/dps buff in a pinch. The 2 orbs generated from artist ult is great at giving you options for what you need. Usually I ult after Iron Maiden mechs to give dps buffs if I don't have enough gauge
Right after the 2nd bomb of the showtime mechanic. So that the person who goes M3 can get gauge filled up by standing In the yellow rings to enter G3.
3 spender hallu is a realistic build and probably the top actual performing build atm for WD
There was one very good structure in the shop that's sadly not avaible anymore called "ANSM-L". Right now I'm using the structures from the masterpiece quest and ignea tokens.  For outfits, I have Nia's and Payla's Vern ball outfit but that one costs 350BC so you're gonna have to craft for a long time for it to pay back its cost
ah, guess I gotta jump on all the fun at the auction house. Thank you!
Thanks for much for this! I'll definitely use this !!
damn maxroll, loll jk. Thanks for the tip!
Thx! I'm Gunslinger
Yeah but the pet is at 5 and 10 clears, right? So how can I show that I've cleared first week, that's what I meant, sorry for the confussion.
Is Preemptive Strike the most useful by far? Which engravs are typically used?
ty for the info! Is there going to be an event/easy way to get my character to tier 3 later?
ty
Hey so I was able to enter for Asura for the second time today and finish the second quest for the soul.
Where can I find Payla’s outfit? I checked the shop but couldnt find it?
Region? Which class spec and stats are you looking for? I just built a cheap spec crit tth
[Bigger horns than normal ones exist for that.](https://preview.redd.it/q7bmgf76p4j81.jpg?width=1320&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=23cb3ab53096a10eff3cdac94829551039324f78)
Just Preemptive on DPS. Anything more is unnecessary.       It's mostly skills that are swapped around because some classes (Tai Scrapper, FI Wardancer for example) don't have any AoE.
nice! I'm in Azena, doing PM though
Thank you very much!
got it, thank you
Losing 0.3% efficiency on kbw literally does not matter. It’s not as if it’s useless when slightly below, it’s only a comparison to alternatives. Don’t worry so much about that.
I calculated the difference some time ago and came to the conclusion that it's 14% dmg vs 10% CDR + 8% atk/move speed.  I'm going to use swift myself because it is more fun and the damage is very similar in normal content. Crit is superior if you play with atrophines and a spec bard, but it's very niche and mostly for hell content I would say
My preference is crit/spec bracelet + swift/spec necklace. With 5x3+1 this leaves me at ~80% crit which leaves room for anther crit synergy. Ancient bracelet upgrade and lvl 3 gear set will add a bit more crit % too.   Can’t underestimate the effect of some swift in a real raid for DE. Especially if you’re still working with some lvl 7 CD gems and are not partied with aspeed buffs from bard/DB.
We get lvl 3 set so I'm definitely switching to a spec-swift stat allocation on ancient 5x3+1. It's just to allow things like expose weakness from supp or being partied with another crit synergy on non-ideal comps.   Getting more swift is extremely comfy and the gap between spec-crit vs spec-swift is closer given the scenarios above due to overcriting + faster animations/mspd = easier to do dmg on real scenarios.   Trixion parses also have a certain amount of variance to it unless you test it for hours or simulate multiple rotations in a program.
I am going with spec/crit. In my testings (yours too) and this one KR Deadeye, spec/crit is higher DPS unless you get all crit synergies.   And since DE has a crit synergy himself, I never get placed with another crit synergy (unless it's low uptime like Striker and they aren't thinking about his synergy)  So basically if spec/swift **needs** crit synergy to compete with spec/crit, then it's too much of a hassle for me. A pug isn't going to place me and Gunslinger in the same party because most classes will overcap with 20% crit synergy. It's also less realistic to find GS/Arcana/swift WD/control glaivier for every content you do. Otherwise you'll be stronger as spec/crit  And even that doesn't seem to be true. You said spec/crit had 14% higher DPS right? Even if spec/crit and spec/swift both had a gunslinger in their party, that 10% crit won't give 14% DPS boost.   Unless your class specifically benefits from swift, swift is so much lower value than crit/spec in DPS. The AS doesn't make much difference in DPS and CDR is great, but the swift to CDR scaling is too low to compete with crit/spec. The only time AS would give a noticeable DPS boost is if it was the breakpoint between landing 2 shotgun skills vs 3 shotgun skills during a DPS window. But that is very boss specific and theoretical (as in I dunno if there are windows where that is true although there probably is some)
The swift is indispensable on deadeye, much like the extra swift from bracelet helping a lot personally on igniter sorc.  Depending on what you can buy you can:  Assuming 100qual  550 1590 350  with crit neck, swift ring, spec + swift bracelet  450 1490 550 with swift neck, crit earring, crit + spec bracelet.   From doing generous testing these seem to be the most consistent ones, it's very necessary to be maxing out crit due to entropy + kbw  After it just comes down to what acessories you can buy/money you want to spend
Trixion dps is tricky, why?  You don't do exact same damage each time.  You may have same crit rate overall but not the same skill.  You don't know when kbw negative side triggered.  Timer might end on upcoming big dps skill.  For best result you manually calculate expected damage but takes time and it lacks the rotation. If you add the rotation that is alot of math and variables.
I'm going to run both since I got an 8/7 stone and can just swap in a cheap 3/4 relic neck.  But I'm expecting to main crit spec as that burst is everything and not criting really hurts.  That being said I don't expect to be able to afford 2 90q 3/6 accessories any time soon to make it worth it.
Spec/swift feels just so much better imo.  I was using a budget crit eh5 ring with spec/swift neck for a long time but recently bought a nice high quality eh5 spec ring, so snagged a deal on a good spec/crit neck.   I used the build for about a week and then went back to spec/swift neck.  Yea it feels like trash when I miss crits right now, which won't be as much of a problem with ancients, but it felt so much worse just walking without swift. Even little things like squeezing in a full srf after rolling calis hit before phase change, I wasn't able to do on spec/crit.
That is true, the comment on kbw is quite useless, but the comparison of the raw dps difference is still quite significant based on my trixion tests and the math imo.
Yeah this seems to align with my numbers as well, I suppose I'll just have to test both out eventually and start out with the swift variant since it'll be the new experience.
Yeah now that I think about it when my support dies of cringe and I lose yearning it's definitely noticeable. I guess this same effect can be felt when going for the swift build. Rocking lvl 9 and 8 cds currently and no plans to go cds on 10 so should feel pretty good.
Yeah if I'm going swift neck as I stated in my original post I'll prolly sacrifice some spec for crit consistensy, since it made sense math wise too.
Yeah that's why I like to do the test a couple of times and take an average and also compare the tests to math using average dps increases. My main point was just to give a bit of context to their difference.
This week the servers have been so fucked for me. Insane desync even with 30 ping.
500iq, 500ms
LOL
I've had this exact same thing happen to me before, very confusing.
This can happen on gate 2 x120 as well. It's really disorienting when it happens.
Ya servers this week are bugging hard.
Last week I had a desync on Gate 2 where I during the winged clones where I ran fully from 7 to 11, stood in place for the mech and died. I asked people on Discord how I died. Everyone else saw my body still standing at 7. I had apparently never moved. 30ms ping.
No joke it’s been so bad this week ruined a deathless for me
i haven't even held a level 10 gem, wow
Thanks for supplying our level 10 gem market.
Did you make profit? (':
Dam you gambled the picture away
Wait "or above"? Is there lvl 11 gems? xD
\-1.5 m gold
Aware
Post it to r/lostarkbets
That’s it after fusing that many level 10 gems? Did you pad this achievement fusing tier 2 gems or something?
r/therewasanattempt
i thought it was impossible to lose money with lvl 10 fem fusing since you get your money back if you fuse 1 dmg out of 3 which is %66 chance of getting your money back and %33+ of winning money
That hurts
Lmao
Idk how the prices are right now, but u only profit or even just break even if u get an even split due to ah taxes  Gem prices are adjusted based on that
I got Demons Roar a few weeks after Helltan released and then quit because there was no more difficult content. Returned about a month ago and had to unequip the title because now people expect me to be a god at every raid when I’ve only run Brel and clown a handful of times. Everybody has a learning curve for every raid, don’t worry about the toxic losers and just go at your own pace :)
The worst part that i see are the characters that were powerpassed to 1445, now they are 1460 and want to be 5x3 1540 in 2 weeks because they HAVE TO. We were at 1460 for couple of months making 5x3, gathering mats etc. So pls, just take Your time, this game is not a sprint. You still have to learn a lot about legion raids, your class etc and just become a better player.
As a new player, I joined a learning party for clown gate1 last week. There was 3 new player and 1 veteran 1560(+?). That person was so chill, even after all the dumb mistakes we made, never got mad, gave tips, was cool even when we wiped 3 times to the same thing back to back. We managed to clear 3gates, or rather he managed to carry our asses while also teaching us the fight. He made the experience very enjoyable. I’m still not joining reclear but i learned a lot thanks to him. If you read this thank you wallycx. I hope you one tap all your gear in the future, and get 100 quality on your accessory.
Exactly i my self quit the game before Clown was released and came back 5 weeks after Brelshaza so it was so hard to get accepted and learn the mechanics for 2 new raids  But my old static did help me with Brelshaza 1-4 and clown and i have been doing Brelshaza 1-4 since never tried 5 and 6 and I'll never will dont care about PLC and won't learn the fight cuz i dont actually planning to do ever
I’m a brand new player who has held off on this game because of all the negativity around the game - gatekeeping, bots, time commitment, etc. I’m not super stoked about end game content, so I’m just slowly finishing up the story and it’s been brilliant. The battle mechanics and the graphics feel amazing. I just don’t understand the appeal of rushing everything - maybe that’s just me
I didn't know Brel'shaza was from the Void
I returned to play Artist, got the gs to do some raids but no one invite me because, I think of the roster lvl, so i'm almost quitting again and waiting for the aeromancer.
if you wont treat this game like a job, then you need to treat this game like a tourist or you can just fuck off.  \- Lost Ark Financial Strategic Division
Very good post however the game unfortunately feels like a job with all the homework and raids you need. Everything else I agree.
I returned to the game because of the artist patch and after an hour the game already reminded me why i quit.
''Don't treat this game like a job'' - nice joke. You have to treat this game like a job else your first unlucky honing session from 1445 and onwards will feel like a massive kick in the teeth, and your nuts, at the same time. And spoiler alert, you will get like 20 of those on your way to 1490.  And second spoiler alert: ppl will still not invite you for raids because of gems, engravings, secondaries, titles, cards or roster level.
"Do you buy a Bus?" YESS for me. I never enjoyed raids in this Game. Been buying buses since last year and never looked Back. Last "raid" I enjoyed learning was Velganos Back then before Valtan release. Mostly because I could run it solo at my true own pace all the Times I wanted without hindering other's progress or jailing them with my thousand Errors or my slow&Safe gameplay as I don't even want to be a "gigachad".   Other early raids like Oreha or Argos I just learned them by brute force matchmaking and nowadays they are Homework as Most If Not all of my 14 chars are past 1415. That is how I have my fun without treating the Game as a Job. Even with my reduced gold income I have enough gold to buy some weekly buses and keep honing. Ditching all Legion raids and doing mostly solo content is how I enjoy the Game.   When my main reachs 1540 I will try to "learn" Hanumatan solo while the rest of the players enjoy progging Brel hard. Will take lots of tries and surely more than 10 min with my non-meta build but the guardian seems fun for 1v1 at iLvl
Out of curiousity, which class were you waiting for?
Been playing consistently up to Vykas. Then I started playing less and hopping in occasionally.  There will be more legion raids, more catching up.  If that's how next few years of Lost Ark is gonna look then nah.  But story. It's not great and captivating either and side content for collectibles is grindy too. Tried Rowen and it's absolutely average.  Not to mention daily content activity is very boring and repetitive.
but you have to treat it as a job  blame the devs, not the players because that’s what they created. The game feela like a deadline because of the raids
Labeling hell mode players as toxic is unfair and damaging to the community. Call out toxic people for being toxic. Don't pigeonhole people.
> Steer clear of these players because 80% of them are incredibly toxic if you mess up.   You know that people who did hellmode actually need a lot of patience, right? So, most likely they are imposters who get toxic...
It depends on what you mean by accomplished. If you mean gear, them bois be g2g enjoyers and boosted. They say absolutely nothing and just fail and fail.
I’ve never seen Addicted to delight players tilt or rage in a pug. Probably because they wouldn’t have that title if they had that mindset. In fact their always the most quiet ones in my experience. Demons roar on the other hand eh, lol.
Its a Job dude
The one thing that i hate about those new/returning players these days, is that they don't type anything. Today for example (after having met so many for the last months), we were doing our homework Vykas runs and we had to kick so many of them, because  1. they don't talk to say they are new, which we would have explained and helped them with.  2. they really don't know the raid at all or just completely forgot about it and still refuse to communicate. 3. not using their nades/pots and stuff like that where all others are contributing to the smooth run of the raid.     When you call t hem out, they cry that you're toxic.  No, toxic would've been us kicking you on the 1st fail but we still give chances and try to give people free buses but some really abuse the generosity of others.
Are you on NAW? :) I'd love to be able to join your learning party for Brel. I'm also a recently returning player
\> **it's still video game and not a job**   &#x200B;  you're telling the wrong people this.
Just returned an hour ago and am doing the story express. Here for the ride and I’m sure I’ll hit a point where no one is called xyzjijklop . Loving the combat and have maxroll up on my second monitor to track my progress. Cheers
It's actually kinda funny, I play a decent amount of hell mode myself and have a ton of atd/demon floor friends, (personally only have demon floor and normal vykas clear and not ATD) - I usually have my demon floor title equipped because i like the icon and we were randomly pugging brel 1-6 (3 of my friends and me). We had a ATD pug sorc that had the highest ego out of the moon, made major mistakes in g4 multiple times and one of my friends called her out that the mech x works like x (don't remember exact detail) -  Sorc just answered: "I KNOW I AM ATD BRO STFU".  We were just confused because atd means you know how to greed dps on average and play on item level but it has nothing to do with brel knowledge, it just means you pretty much mastered the vykas raid and nothing else. People need to understand that actually even a average player can get ATD if they just spam hell vykas for months, especially on paladin.  The convo escalated a bit and went a bit into the toxic direction, but in the end the sorc was like "your opinion doesn't matter, you see my title? this is something you'll never have".. tfw my 3 friends went ahead and equipped atd title wrote "shorely" then we quit raid and we just kicked her xd.  For anyone reading this sad/funny story - remember while hell titles will on average provide you with very knowledgeable/skilled players - they aren't gods, I will take a hell mode title player anytime for any content but in the end if something looks sus, don't be afraid to call them out.
Massive respect for both you and the people in your party. I’m glad you had a good experience!
You aren't at the part where a lot of players with 6 or more characters are trying to run through 3 legion raids each a week on top of their dailies/horizontal/etc. That's where the rush is, the lack of time for people who want to do everything.
My man, what makes you think coming back for Aero will be any better than your current situation.
you NEED 2 chaos dungeons, 3 unas daily ( or every 3 days ) and 3 raids a week. If youre doing more than that, its on you
I think you will have a blast once you reach 1490, because that's when you can go into trixion and 1v1 prokel any time you want.
Artist! I actually became excited for lost ark because I saw that Artist was releasing in Korea. I was a bit disappointed when I saw it wasn’t on the starting roster. You can imagine how I felt when I realized it wasn’t going to be released for at least a year lol.
Honest question: Aren't the raids always there? What drives the deadline?
its more nuanced, yes you have some points regarding the game's design, but it's more complex, there is a bit a personal responsibility as well in this equation, if you get burned out, frustrated or treat the game as a job, thats also on you, at the end of the day its just a video game. That means you play too much video games
I am also a hardcore content enjoyer in many games. Hell mode and other difficult content definitely requires a lot of patience for prog. Unfortunately, I’m only pointing out what I’ve noticed.
just want to point out that having patience in achieving their goals and losing their patience in a weekly homework clear are two different things
Yes and no, hell clearers tend to be more supreme than others, i know because i have permanent AtD on all my chars. It took weeks to get DL and once I did it feel so good.  For your "patience" point, they have time to play more than six gold earner, doing 18 raids a week and may be doing dailies on them every single day, so they did have lot of patience to begin with. Very few people who has hell titles have lower than 6 characters.
Ironically I’ve found the pay to win players to be the least toxic of all. I haven’t come across boosted players all that much. What I mean by most accomplished is both skill and gear.
i agree. i only ever get a bit annoyed when its repeated wipes with new players refusing to learn. i cant teach you if you dont want to be taught. its such a shame
ATDs with big egos are bussed 10/10. Be it with actual money or by playing a Paladin.  Real ATDs just take 35% MVP without saying a word and go on with their day.
Guy honestly probably bought title. It is possible to get ATD on pally by spamming it for months, but I honestly only know one person like this on NAE. And they were pretty much blacklisted because of poor buff uptime and griefing runs.
But why do they do that? Like what’s the point?
At least I can do party activities while leveling.
Your forgot the part where you do this everyday and 6x for characters
My main is already 1530 and from time to time I do Prokel in Trixion. Takes many tries and a long time to defeat him but prefer to do it there rather than in the raid
Yeah i do, i used to play reaper on RU so waiting ten months to play my class again didn’t feel good
fomo
because if you dont do them you lose a lot of progress   raids here are still mandatory even after you get your gear from them because gold is your main currency  I shouldn’t be doing a year old raid but the game forces me to do it and lets not say YoU cAn jUsT nOt Do ThEm  yes i can but I “cant” for the reason stated above.  the game isn’t healthy, lets fault the devs and the environment they created, not the players
Two sets of forces drives players to have this deadline mindset.  The first is from the devs. Your gear progression is heavily tied to raiding. Back before they relaxed the relic gear requirements, you have to run Valtan/Vykas for weeks to get the wings and bones you need to complete your relic sets. Vykas wings were especially painful, because you only get 6 per NM raid, and you need about 40 for most sets. If you can get to 1460, then you can speed it up, but then you'd need the gold to hone to 1460+, because realistically, you're not getting into HM groups on ilvl.  To then upgrade your gear to lvl 2 sets, you need 75 trumpets. Each full run of clown (and it's very doubtful you can successfully run clown g1-3 every week if you are only 1475 - 1500) gives you 10 trumpets if you fail in getting the auction box. That's about 8 weeks of clown raiding to get your full level 2 gear set.  Then to upgrade to ancient gear, you need 300 brel horns. They give you 40 horns on your first clear as some sort of consolation prize, and you get 14 total horns for every two gates of brel you clear. Because of the staggered gate requirements, you can't run all 6 week by week unless you're already at 1520 when you started running brel, and that is a lot of honing. It takes about another 2 months of weekly raiding to get your full brel set if you did it by starting at 1490 and only honing your brel gear.  Periodically, the devs will force you to move your characters further up the ivl line by nerfing gold from older raids and dungeons. This time round they nerfed argos, valtan and vykas, but they already did that before with oreha normal mode, around the time of the 2nd hyper express.  The second set of forces come from the players. Most people don't want to raid on ilvl. It is very hard. Or, I should say, you actually have to be really good at the raid to raid on ilvl. Most people in this game aren't actually that good. With the valtan gold nerf, I'm seeing a lot more 1445s to 1460s in valtan HM now, and the people in there are so clearly used to overgearing valtan. To overgear though, you need gold to hone and buy your gems/accessories/hone, which you are mostly getting from your.....weekly raids.  And people try hard to push for week 1 release of new content on at least 1 character. The reason being that the perception of the community is week 1 is where all the learning parties occur. It's not, but it's also true that generosity in the Lost Ark community usually only surface during week 1. Past that, few people want to run any more learning parties to teach or help the community, and nobody has patience for anybody else after either.  The two things feed on each other, driving this sense of "I have to get it done, or I fall behind" feeling.
What nuance? The devs decide how the game is supposed to be played, and the player decides what is fun. And usually what is fun and how it is designed are aligned for most players. It's 99% the design's fault anf 1% the player's.
Nah, not really tbh. Have all titles myself 15 chars and never tilted once in a pug. Because I know we are humans and no machines and the less pressure is in the game the better the people play.  I really think people who go crazy are indeed not very mental stable. And people like that tend to buy titles because they would never stand the hell of AtD.
Yea p2w people dont say sht. Even if you flame them. I think they play on full mute. The most sccomplished its about an 80/20 split they toxic af. But there is no middle ground. They are either super toxic, or the most helpful person you will run into
To be the most efficient and get the most gold and materials out of their roster because they only have a week or day to do it. You have to remember that as of now, the latest raid is almost 4 months old. So a majority of people are running raids for the gold/materials it provides and not the lore.
Seems like you are just fomoing
I see, so the raids are your gold generation to further hone, buy things, ect...?     I can see how doing that on a bunch of characters weekly would be fatiguing for sure. I'm guessing the alternative is to swipe too.     It seems like Lost Ark is a fun game for a casual play, but extremely frustrating if you're trying to stay with or ahead of the curve.
It seems that the devs REALLY want you in these raids every week. They've put all the eggs in this basket.   My next question, and one I'm personally trying to figure out is: Where does this put a new player? How do I engage with this content without "jailing" people?  I know the obvious answer is to find a static, but for the sake of further discussion, where does a solo player exist in this ecosystem?
I have the titles and I can definitely see why people who have gotten them could have less patience. We spend so long doing the hard version of these raids, and some of us even keep doing it for fun after getting deathless. For Vykas/Valtan, and eventually Clown once hell for that comes out, they aren't very fun because if I wanted to have fun and enjoy the raid I would just be playing hell mode. So I see it as a quick 10 minute adventure to get my gold and get out.  So yeah, if I join a homework party and we wipe multiple times, I'll start to lose my patience. I don't start yelling at people or anything, but I can definitely see why OP found that these players were more likely to be toxic. Not that it's a good excuse.
Because most whales are adults who don’t really care.
 What do gold materials do for you?
seems like you’re insane if you think doing a years old raid weekly is normal
Yes, and they made it frustrating so people would give up and just pay for the progression instead. This is how they make money in the end of it all.  I know he's being downvoted and called "fomo nerd" but he's not wrong.  It is completely normal to wish to be up to date in an MMORPG you play, and it is completely normal to enjoy the content as it releases. But in Lost Ark, if you are a casual non-paying player, you can only access to new content months after it drops. And by that time most people will be already familiar with the raid, and you will be shunned upon when you make mistakes, or people straight won't play with you. Also, the hype won't be there as playing the raid in day1 of the release.
Realistically speaking, you are going to jail some people some of the time in this game. Everyone does, and anybody that claims otherwise has overrated himself.  You can be tired that day, or just pushed a new alt you're not familiar with and you're still getting used to the rotations, or just get horrible patterns in a row.   To get back to the new player question....honestly I would not play this game for long if I am new, or returned after quitting several months. There are learning discords and communities that alleviate many of the self-inflicted problems the community faces, but there's a bunch of other things that just makes it harder as a new player to start, chief of them being gold, and that some of the power progression lies behind horizontal content, which is seriously unfun these days, with bots and the complete absence of actual players in the lower tiers.  A great deal of patience is what you'd need as a new player, but you know, it might be more worth it for the new player to go check out other games.
Why you join HW-Parties if you did hellmodes? I host lobbies and pick people. I would never expect anything if I join lobbies… and if I would, I would never be toxic because I know about the diversity of peoples skill. It’s not their responsibility to feed your questionable expectations…
Then dont do it. Or bus it, its gonna be completely different experience.
my friend who returned for artist wanted to try out some other classes and ended up buying 3 South vern powerpasses. that's like 150$ and he end up quitting again.
Well, first, it's much faster to join a lobby that's at 6/8 or 7/8 than host one, especially if you're solo. All my DPS are 1540+ and have title so I get insta-accepted 99% of the time. I do make sure to join only high roster groups with title, so it's very smooth 90% of the time. Second, I said I'm not toxic. It can be frustrating when we wipe, but I don't take it out on people. I can just see that my demographic would probably be much more likely to become toxic, as OP said.  Also, difference in player skill is one thing, but causing multiple wipes in a homework run is another. I expect most players to do poor damage- this is a skill difference. I don't believe simply executing mechanics is a skill issue. Especially in a homework run, mistakes like messing up a mechanic and causing a wipe shouldn't happen. I get that everyone makes mistakes, and I don't mind if someone messes up once, but if it happens multiple times from one person, then yeah it's not really a matter of skill - it's them not knowing the raid well and griefing everyone else by joining a homework run.
“then dont do it”  then how tf am I gonna play the content on release date? I’m actually curious to read your answer cuz most of yall downvote without saying anything  about bussing, yes I agree its refreshing to bus but my friends quit cuz they got tired of the weekly repetitive experience and now I’m playing the game solo now so I stopped trying to bus
😂 poor damage. Yea well, even if people are dead - as a decent player it’s easy to compensate that. Exception is g5. Are you on EUC? I have some brels left..
Im playing with only 1 character and somehow Im doing everything on release, you can do it
Yeah... I'm pretty used to people doing shocking amounts of (low) damage. But I really don't mind at all in non-hell mode. There are no DPS checks.  But nah, I'm on NAE. Good luck with those brels xd
so ur character is brel hard ready 1560 with good gems etc? how do  uget enough gold to hone  I spent around 40k raw gold from 1555 and 1560 cuz i pitied almost two pieces  if i’m playing only 1 character then that basically the whole gold I got from raids in the past 3-4 weeks
I just bus clown and brel and hone when I can. There is so much free mats from everything I dont have to buy anything. Alts take forever to pay off investment so its actually easier to hone with 1 character
I find standing in the middle as a group is faster than each player going to a corner
Imagine thinking a supp without preemptive strike is gonna be the difference in a 1490 cube when everyone is 1520+
People just go in with their CD build and no one is going to bother optimizing it for cube. Personally, I use different sets or builds depending on the class and not all use betrayal and/or preemptive. The only character I actually run betrayal on is my arcana, mostly to farm for Emperor cards. My most preferred is salvation for the atk speed on slower classes like sorc, SH, and glaiv. On my bard, I use charming and dominion for artist.
Too uninterested to look into it, I do all content with one build.
Preemptive strike doesn't matter cuz I 1 shot everything.  I don't really need betrayal cuz somebody will have it and I ask em to stand in middle so all mobs aggro to a single point of the map.
Soneone don't Play omegalultoptierbuildforeverything kinda post? I have 1546 on main and I'm using betrayal, but i needed to Google what the fuck Preemptive is. Why should I invest any money into build for single piece of content that i do maybe twice a week if i have bad rng with Boss rush tickets? Like dude... If you want to be 120% efficient in a fucking cube, go and pf it lol.
tbh cube nowaday is much more easier than season 1 there's no need to switch around your build just for that
I used to go in with Caos build (preemp and betrayal) but the only risk to fail are trials where shields and heals can have a Good use... So i prefer to enter as support for this reason (those lower 1490 i enter with Caos build instead if i still grab some tickets from guild shop)
I don't use Betrayal for any content. I hate the set.
Bc i dont have cd setup on destro and arti
>and it means everyone is pulling their weight more equally.  Lol as a pally main(5x3 setup) there is no equal weight pulling when im doing 40-50% of the dmg 99% of the time, please just stay mid.
haha yearning on artillerist go brrrrt
Usually it's b.c I was lazy and never setup the preset and just keep forgetting or I don't have betray unlocked yet but still run it b.c the cube vs boss rush drop rate is so off I'd rather not bank 100 tickets like I did on my GL and arti at one point.  Even at x3 it still drains u. Silver was nice though
I don't really give a shit what people run, but it's annoying when ppl stand in the corner instead of grouping up in the middle so I can easily nuke everything
Because I don't care about cube. Did my hopefully last ever ticket today without betrayl. U mad?
Imagine optimizing for cubes.
Thats probably because said people won't run pre+betrayal so don't insta 1 shot everything on spawn. All grouped in middle you fight over who hits what, waste abilities aiming at the same stuff, and ranger spawns in corner just hit you until you run over there anyway.
Corner is most efficient tho for killing filler trash as most floors have them spawn there.
Good chaos build is in most cases also cube-optimal build - very few classes don't benefit from Preemptive at all (some weird multihit builds that also don't run betrayal - since preemptive works on betrayal procs), about half of chaos builds either prefer to or can opt into running Betrayal, and if neither of those is true - Contender is another strong option, especially to replace Grudge that for most time is a dead engraving - there is no reason not to run Contender if there's Grudge/Cursed Doll in your normal build to be replaced, it's a direct upgrade for non-boss content.  From classes you mention:  * Sorc - depends on build. Swiftflux chaos works best with Nightmare, betrayal being second (just for extra damage), 2dom/4nm being an option too. Classless wants betrayal for off-chance of free meter generation, or Nightmare. Igniter makes chaos unfun, but if you run it - just go Betrayal for free identity RNG. Preemptive in all cases lets you run lower damage variants with shorter cooldowns, on classless only Contender is a bit better option. * Shadowhunter - good mobility, good AoE, can greatly utilize free identity while in demon form; no reason not to run Betrayal. Also Preemptive makes everything you do oneshot, without having to rely on just part of your kit. * Bard - current chaos meta is running Dominion+Preemptive with bunch of AoE oneshot skills (Heavenly Tune, Sonatina, Prelude of Storm, Sonic Vibration), charm does reduced damage to multiple opponents and is quite bad for non-boss content. Betrayal + Preemptive + Contender is an option if you lack tripods/gems/weapon quality/ilvl. * Glaivier - no idea honestly.
You are something else.... what class are you playing?
Yeah but if someone pings mid they're delusional anyway, you afk corners with filler aoe / betrayal on their spawn.
Lol, lmao even. Preemptive is a really good engraving for chaos dungeons, especially for supports. Maybe if you're a one character andy you won't find much use for it, but for people who have a full roster it's a great engraving.
You don't need to swap it yourself you just click the drop down for the preset you use in chaos
Someone doesn't play support
We talking about CD's now?
It's more annoying ppl pinging mid, my spawn is dead anyway literally the other corners. Instead of running around like headless chicken or waiting for mobs to group up, just go to your corner and insta kill them.
You don’t need preemptive strike or betrayal to one shot anything in cube. Almost everyone is overgeared for both normal and hard cube
My artist doesn't have betrayal because it doesn't have gear conversation since i pushed it to 1490 week one. Gotta take a gold nerf for one week for more valtan bones
Di sh doesn't need betrayal  she os everything with everything
I can see it working on classes with good AOE already in their raid build like DI SH, Reflux Sorc, or Master Summoner. However most classes are pretty bad without a dedicated build and preemptive.
Reflux, Control, TTH and RE.
Ah yes, support thing. Sorry i don't have support in roster and won't. I use betrayal for 2 characters in chaos/cube, rest of them just don't need more aoe. And as you used "andy" i don't even want to talk anymore. There is no point in talking with this type of players.
If you have a betrayal set you use in chaos.  I have 8 characters and only 2 use some special chaos set.  For those with a special chaos build I bring it to cube.
Never ever used betrayal on my bard, charming supremacy sorry
Funnily, out of the supports right now bard works better with dominion than betrayal - you have enough oneshot screenwipe AoEs (assuming preemptive + contender) to not need extra damage procs from set, cutting cooldowns with Dominion is better.  It's classes that don't have one button instant screenwipe that benefit from Betrayal - or classes that rely on identity resource for fast clears. I find Betrayal far more important on Deadeye and Paladin than on Bard or Gunslinger.
I play all 3 Supports, 1555 Bard, 1540 Paladin, 1505 Artist. Betrayal in my eyes is completely useless on them because have you seen how much AOE they have and how low their cooldowns are (assuming you don't change from Swiftness stat)? The truth is if your damage is completely dependent on a RNG effect from a set that doesn't have 100% uptime and/or the first damage tick on an undamaged mob, then your DPS build is scuffed.
If he could read he would be very angry now
I have gear conversion on my artist and on first time tried doing hard cube on chaos build (dominion for crane spam) and it didnt feel good. I took a ton of dmg from everything and healing is bad with chaos build. So now for cube i run support build with betrayal. Not ideal for dmg when betrayal is on cd but atleast i can now keep ppl healed up.  Ideally would probably have a mix of sup/chaos build for cube but not worth gearing for it.
See that's fair, but unfortunately the majority doesn't seem to be the case, just lazy or misinformed.
He mainly plays swiftness thats why. I dont change anything on my reflux sorc but i play mainly back attackers. DE, STRIKER,shock scrapper. Its hell without them
Swiftness classes are good with 1 build re is kinda meh without the betrayal
You're probably a mage roster andy if you don't use preemptive or betrayal
Second miss. Only glavier in my roster isn't Ambush Master :v and I'm thinking of swapping her to Control :v some more mistakes about my playstyle?  I'll do it for you: Yes, i don't play super efficient. Yes, sometimes i don't even try to do all my raids. Yes, i don't consider myself a pro in any aspect. Yes, I'm not f2p (I'm not big spender bcs in my country crystals are worth fuckton of money, I'm just buying aura and arkpasses) I don't know what more you can think will offend me, but if there is something more, keep adding shit to the list :v
Hello Ragnortsxx
I'm 4 hones away from where ur roster is at lol gg
I think I am playing wrong man . I am day1 player roster 220 and My 6 gold earner still have 1455 character :D Only 3 brel hm character
Same point as you finished honing yesterday. The mats were well saved up but the raw gold ate my gold revenue for 2-3 weeks..
noice
On an alt I need to do NM1-2 to get the final piece for a cheaper 1540, so yeah gg that alt, its first Ancient piece delayed until next next reset. Shouldve won more bids smh
My roster all looks similar but I can’t really move my 1540s even with their bound mats. The raw gold from the honing button is killing me and feels like Frog has annihilated gold income.
Lookimg like a flex, i tell you what tho. You on nae? We going tk be great friends
A nice big plump roster
Nice, but why does your Paladin look like a ninja lol
Your Sorc and SH are so cute. I love the glasses on your SH so much\~
Looking really good! Personally just finished 5x chars 1550 and main 1565 only bc people will be gatekeeping new guardian raid :/
I see that your artillerist is only 1540, he needs to be akkan ready right this instant !  Hope you'll have smooth  g1-2HM runs next week :) (and up to g6 for your main)
😂 forgot to block main char name great 😂
hope you'll have easy hones
you are doing something wrong i think 😅
thank you
is it a late addition alt to your roster?
If any of your characters have full Brel gear, you are good to go, you only need the achievement on one character:) In this case just go 1-2hm and disenchant the armor piece to get the horns back. Hopefully you’ll have enough for your final piece then. If not, doing 3-4(5-6)nm slowly til you get them is perfectly fine  Edit: ok nvm I misunderstood what you mean
for books it has a lot of people kept their books adter frog to sell and the prices are even lower now than when frog was here
in on EUC
thank you ^ ^
wish there was a char similar to samurai
cuz i love the outfit i dont have a berserker so closest to it was my paladin
ty ^ ^ i love her too she looks really good
ah yes probably lol
i wish haha my arti has the worst luck for honing :(  and thank you, im not gonna fomo its too much pain xd
i wish haha my arti has the worst luck for honing :(  and thank you, im not gonna fomo its too much pain xd
why is people down voting my post? :(
3 hones now no shards on last 😭
Yeah theyre late. But I cant complain now cant I, since I have triple 1560... Ill just accept the L and move on. I can hone 16-17, but that shit not worth and expensive.
Yeah. Seeing some books at the end of raids use to be a decent gold boost. Now it just feels like chump change.
probably cuz they consider such posts as unnecessary flexing and adds nothing to their enjoyment ... anyways, good looking roaster mate and as always, good luck!
Don't worry about the downvote . Just enjoy your progression in this game and post whatever you want
because the game is dying , the game content is too repetitive.
so close yet so far 😭
ah yes if you have 3 1560 cant complain there xd
well i just like sharinf my progress ive done it since i had my alts at 1460, people seemed to like it back then 😂
thank you i know it looks like a flex but ive been posting my progression since 1460 😅
thats whats mmorpgs though irs meant to be repetetive
dont worry about the haters ... i personally would like to see more flex posts of good rng and overall account progress to show ppl that hard work is rewarded rather than more uselsss bots/gatekeeping and crying posts that solve nothing and do nothing other than hurt the game by making it less appealing to new comers...  I'll admit, I am a bit jealous of ppl with good raosters, so good work bro ... I personally only like playing one main but still make new alts for free mats/silver etc.  anyways, keep up the good work :)
thank you, your answer made my day. Hope you will have a nice roaster as well
you need to buy the workshop recipe from a merchant in your stronghold   if i recall correctly she stands next to the stairs at the harbour
In your stronghold, open the crafting workshop and it will be under the Tools tab, then go down to Fishing Tool
I don't remember cause it was a very long time ago but maybe you need to research the crafts in your stronghold.
could be bugged, contact support  I couldn't craft tool repair parts for a year
it isnt there, and in my shop aswell, so it must be somewhere on my characters but cannot find it :D
Did you maybe accidentally put it in the pet storage tab or other storage?
noice sssssss
SSSSSSS
That's an S tier typing test
Thought someone would spacebar last second on your tile with the snake emote but good clip still!

Nice hiss
there's a preset channel in the lost ark discord  in the search bar type "in: presets Assassin" without the quotes
Yes, a casual players lost ark career is summed up by how many reddit posts they can create due to 1 singular bad experience.
So 6 players were alright, 1 was toxic. Looks fine, doesn't seem to be a big problem. Yes some people are toxic. A lot are not :-)
Argos lmao 🤣  That guy is not going anywhere
LOL an argos rager, well ill be damned
If you been playing MMOs for a while you should have come across some more bad apples.
I've noticed people are more toxic at the low entry content, i only have these experiences on my low lvl alts. But in general its rare, most people will just not say anything and quit the raid instead after a few wipes.   There are tools that are a bit hidden for new players:   - switch character in between gates of a raid. You will get a ticket for reentry and to everyone else it just looks like you dc'ed. Just say you're out and do it if people are too much of a pain. You might be stuck on a different gate than gate 1 of a raid, but sometimes this is the way to go.      - when inside a raid you can't do the above, just say goodbye and alt-f4. Once you rebooted the game you can hop on a different character, come back later once the folks abandoned the group and get a reentry ticket.   I always make sure to say i am leaving before doing it, so any other players in there is not sitting around waiting cause they think i dc'ed.   Reentry tickets can take up to 24 hrs to arrive, and i've tried once to never get one in boss rush, but never in raids, always get them.
Like in every hobby and/or activity under the sun there are wholesome, nice people and people vying for jackass of the month award, you just had bad luck and found one this time.
Not gonna lie its a pretty tilting way to die if someone takes your safe spot. Were you following x3 rules?  Either way, its no reason to rage since Argos gives you 4 lives. Sadly someone getting tilted over one mistake is pretty common in pugs. All it takes is one guy to sour the mood for everyone and with Lost Ark being as grindy as it is, people have low patience as is.
Is this what lost ark is really about? Based off one toxic guy? Idk man
Trust me, I quit LA for my own reasons and I think it has the best community in terms of non-toxic people. Don’t sweat it.
You say you have been playing MMO for a long time and only now you came across a toxic person. My good man were you playing MMOs with bots only then. Yes there are toxic people everywhere, including lost ark. Mute them, ignore them and move on with your gaming.
Why is it always a zerker that is toxic?
are u ok? am seriously asking cuz am concerned about u ... the fact that one bad experience made u jump on reddit to cry out and hope someone holds ur hands to tell u everything will be alright is very alarming and sad to see ... if some online troll flames u and u get that upset then bro, u need to be hugged more often and probably GET A LIFE ...anyways, have a great day ;)
probably nesw thingy, if you taken his spot, it is normal to him enrage
Gotta work on your mentals, man. You can't change how toxic people behave, but you can control how you react to them. Let the toxics be toxic. Just focus on working on yourself, get good at the game and the classes you are playing. Other players are not blind, they will recognize that you are a good player if you are willing to prove it.
this \^ . probs the best objective answer.     Yes, shitheads can be wherever you go, be it in a game or irl but at least full-on flaming others is a fairly infrequent experience in LA.
Getting tilted from a death in Argos is nothing to get mad about. I die quite often when I go to my x3 spot and find it taken.  I just die and tell the person they were in the wrong spot.  No reason to get tilted.  It’s not like you can’t just res or the clear will fail.
It's the Bosses in this game that are supposed to have an enrage mechanic, not players lol
You basically said the same thing as me in the 2nd half of my comment. Its like people just read my first sentence.
Can insert that “You had me in the first half” meme.

The lost ark discord class breakdowns in the pins
Omg thank you how did I not know about this!?
Now that you know, spread it around!  There's also the community discord with class areas for questions/extra info
Before -> If you space bar anytime before the bullets hits the target, they disappear and don't do damage  Now -> If you space bar after bullets starts to drop from sky to target, they will remain and do damage. If you space bar before the bullets starting to drop, they will disappear and don't do damage.
Same with deadeye
Yeah, I’ve tried it at a bunch of different times and never noticed it being like in the notes
Agreed. It is same or maybe even worse than before.  It's not cancelable at all.
Yup. Noticed this day 1. Didnt feel a difference.
As the above comment stated https://youtu.be/ga1lSh5dPc4 https://youtu.be/xE0JoF7ZEPU There's plenty of test video from KR especially since they got the test server.
same, it's not cancellable like Rime Arrows does. l think the bullets have to be finish casted then you can space bar(?) but doing that only save you like a few milliseconds and totally not effective at all
It is not cancellable. It is stated in the patch notes that they only changed the visual on it
It's working as intended. Not a major change.  You are now able to spacebar and switch to rifle stance to make meteor stream get the peacemaker damage buff. You couldn't do this before.
I can speak for Deadeye, the cancel is there, it's just barely useful as the bullet needs to be dropping before you can spacebar cancel it, and Deadeye has such a long spacebar animation that there's little to no benefit to doing the cancel. It's a scam.  GS has a shorter spacebar and can draw a bit more benefit from the cancel (and change weapons, but you don't run Meteor Stream on Deadeye except for on Pistoleer, so there goes that), so once again the boobalady gets all the love while deadgeye gets shafted. >:(
Which is pretty sad because you really want to spacebar cancel as she shoots into the air and not when they start to drop, they could've made this cancel so much nicer
How is DE shafted if they don’t even run the skill?
With a proper spacebar cancel, it could have been a decent Pistoleer burst buff and general QoL improvement as Pistoleer has trouble getting his skills out quickly.
There is an influx of people who bought their accounts. I've seen a few.    This will become a bigger problem as time goes on, because more and more hardcore players will quit between now and future releases.
Just not my experience at all. I do many pugs a week although they are usually partially friends. Yeah, people will mess up here and there but if they have a good sheet with roster and titles its fine more often than not.   To be honest sometimes my statics are worse than pugs because we usually have kept some people around who are not amazing at the game but are just cool people and were happy to all game together.
Only issues I’ve had are in Vykas. But yes this past month has been awful. From the dps shortage to more impostors showing up. It’s really a gamble when you join a decent looking lobby or recruit decent looking people. There’s been an influx of new players as well so just more variables thrown into the mix. Even Vykas 1500+ lobbies aren’t completely safe although they definitely minimize jailing probability. Gatekeeping might get worse honestly.   I’m really not looking forward to when we get the gold nerfs to HM Vykas. I understand why SG is doing it but if you’re going to nerf income, nerf the difficulty as well. These raids should be treated as old (not now but when the gold nerfs come) and something that players should not need to spend more than an hour trapped in one. After all, SG wants to incentivize people to do later content and not simply stick with the easier gold making content
pugs have been fine for months in my opinion only had one bad run in ~3 months
People really missed the point where you said "last month" and I agree with you pugs this month are just pure miss and hit even with PLC I legit had a Gs in my 1-4 calling stars and then didn't even manage to kill 2 stars by the time the mech ended he was 210 roster lvl as well 1530ilvl for people wondering.  And yes pugs quality have gone down by a lot compared to the 2nd month tbh
I pug all my raids on 6 characters, and while some are bad, most of them are extremely smooth. It definitely doesn't happen enough to warrant a post to complain
If you want to reliably clear things quick, statics are always the best option.  I haven’t had any issue with pugs, but I also only get ones like 40 ilvls above the content since minilvls typically don’t care as much
Do you Remember when incubus was legit hard to get? vykas was an easy oneshot even on alt ilvl run, good times. Same thing with mlc and plc before week 10.
5-6 Brel is a shitshow each week, just a complete fucking disaster no matter how juiced the PLC lobby is. 4 is a toss up. Rest is mostly okay, Vykas has memes but very rare to see disbands at 1490+. Clown 3 is either a one tap or 1.5 hours of resetting, rarely anything in-between. Fortunately the clown jail's aren't too common.
Oh is that why those absolute potatoes have been in clown raids the past two weeks? I actually hadn't realized this was the issue and thought it was people just regular-impostering by moving from getting bussed to "trying to play normally". But it actually makes a LOT more sense to believe that that 1560 who couldn't understand clock numbers in clown g2 maze and that other guy who turned into a clown in g1 three separate times and then jailed us in g3 were actually newly-bought accounts rather than people who previously bought busses.
Omg this happened to me today and I was so mad. I joined a lobby of 1500+ on my bard. It’s really hard rn with the dps shortage, so I was happy they accepted me at first.   Then we failed g1 twice which was ok but then we failed g2 a few times. It seemed like only one person was sus, but then we got to g3. This time we died to the first swamp two or three times, people put the pink puddles on the boss, and we didn’t do enough damage to be able to do wei frog (even with many people being 1520). By g3 I realized it wasn’t just one person learning but maybe half the raid
I stopped vykas because of this. I’m patient but it’s way too brutal now
I got brel deathless yesterday in a full pug. Generally pugs have been fine just gotta watch out for red flags. But I've only been doing 1-6 runs, pretty sure 1-4's and 5-6's are lower quality.
This is a problem for any game that doesn't have player performance stats readily available. Just make your own static, and you will save yourself a massive headache every week. People will always try to sneak into a better lobby to get carried, that's just the way the west works. Not many people value other people's time and they simply care about themselves, so you should do the same and not give those jailers a chance to steal your time.
Gatekeep upwards, no weird RMT'ers, no weird account buyers.   Even if you're a legit whale, why are you applying to my lobby? We have a penguin suit wearing alt of a dude who is 147th highest on the region in fishing and a 4x3+2 gunlancer with a 90s movie reference in his name, why the frick do you wanna play with us?   You're weird if you show up here on a 1570 something with multiple lvl 10 gems, thats not following dresscode at all.
I have the same feeling i think its a mix of people burned out that just do raid because they have to and are just tired/bored  And also the fact thats its the end of the brel nm cycle meaning pretty much everyone is here and its hard to filter bad player because they are kinda hidden now   Also its very random i had pugs where we deathless everything and some others where we perma die on clown g2 or people can't do shape
As soon as I read this and went in a G3 gate a 1570 impostor arrives and fails... the 145x mechanic and wipes us. No need to tell the class, YOU KNOW it already. 1570 accs go cheap now apparently bc theres so many of them as impostors.
No, but theres a heavy dps drought so you are either jailed in the raid because you filled with pepegs or you are jailed in the lfg window trying to find decent people (which cannot be guaranteed even by things like roster level or titles these days...)
make a static for clown until the shitters give up and go back to valtan. did all 6 runs in 90 minutes last two resets
Well gatekeeping G1-4 runs based on a G6 Title is stupid anyway.
Brel G3 jail has been hellish these past few weeks
The game is on a dead spiral right now. Thanks to smilegate for their less than stellar gamedesign
> How do you guys clear raids nowadays?   guild static for Brel, pug for anything else (aside from Brel 1-4/5-6 on alts which i do with guildies outside of my static), the only raid where i still occasionally get jailed in is Clown G3 which i only do on new 1475+ characters until i get enough horns.   statics are definitely the way if you want fast and smooth runs, if you rely on pugs you don't know what you're getting at the end of the day.  i've pugged Brel 1-4 twice and it wasn't as painful as i expected (granted it was a lobby full of PLC).   > Because PUGs seem to have lost any measure of gatekeeping since titles and rlevel don't mean anything anymore.  don't worry, gatekeeping is alive and well with unreasonable expectations at times.
It's just you. I do 6 kakul, 6 brel and 6 vykas each week. In total out of all 18 raids with PUG, usually only totals out to about 15 to 20 wipes for each week. Averaging around 1 wipe per raid, isn't really a jail
Look for statics, best way is to bus tbh.
Isn't account selling against TOS or is it still  passable under the kingdom who don't wanna rule by fear
If you overgear, bussing is more consistent, sometimes faster, and give you more gold.
I just had a party with a bunch of 1540 people they told me after clearing gate 1 (with 2 wipes) they’re learning gates 1-2 of Brel and I was like but you already have brel gear why you learning? Also in Vykas and Valtan there’s an interesting amount of sus people with high lvl chars and roster.
Haven’t had much issues running with pugs unless I’m running around Chinese prime times. Yesterday took me almost 2 hours to clear 1-6 Brel.
This is not really directed at OP but more so a general question based on some of the responses in this post ….what’s the difference between sitting hours and hours with a static to learn mechs vs doing the same with a pug?  You may or may not beat it in either instance.  Sure if you put up a pug with requirements KWTD etc and someone going in blind, wiping everybody all the time i can see a frustration because the requirements were upfront. But if you put up a pug and need 7 other people to complete something that tells me your options are already limited so you prolly should be happy with what you get.   When you put those pugs up just remember…. All the videos in the world cant replace experience. And you can’t get experience being gate kept for WHATEVER the reason. This is especially true for the solo player which is your target audience when putting up a pug whether you believe it or not. I know there’s certain damage thresholds that need to be meet by at least some of the party to make the runs go smoother but js sometimes you gotta take the good with a little bad.   Yes i am newer player. No i didnt buy my account. I have roughly 400-500 hours in with a couple 1445 characters with 4x3 engravings level 5-6 gems and a couple more characters I’m in the process of leveling. Most community’s I’ve been apart of, the more experienced guys are itching to show the new guys what to do and experience those moments with newer players. But not this community from my experience. This is a pretty cut throat can’t beat something after one or two wipes and the party is folding community. I know i know…” well that can be any community “ and your right, it can. But its really noticeable in this one.  Hell I’ve been in groups where we don’t even fight anything and someone is pulling out. “ im out…. Dude got level 3 gems”. Bro you suck that bad to where you can’t over come that. So damage phase might take 7 minutes instead of 3-4. Gtfo man.  It’s unfortunate because this game is an absolute blast to play.
Im still pugging and the quality is indeed bullshit some chars jailed for several days but I just keep going and its funny since this damn artist release I haven’t had a week which I cleared all raids pretty sad can’t Imagine how I should do it with 6 chars lmao
Unless your play schedule is extremely variable, anyone would highly recommend forming statics or joining guild runs. There are far too many imposters, whether they're bought accounts or lifelong bus riders. The game's Legion Raid designs are too cooperative and time consuming to allow deadweight. A few bad apples and you've wasted 5-7 people's time. It's the entire reason gatekeeping exists. An unfortunate reality, but the end game content can't be carried by 2-4 people any more like Valtan.  That being said, I mainly run in my static, but I pug every now and then, and I give everyone one strike only. Two strikes and I kick them.
nope just yours
The only thing extremely annoying to pug right now is any content on my paladin.  If i pug i just do like 3-5 big tries before stopping which makes doing raids pretty fast. Sometines groups just kick 1 guy and keep going. If we start try 3 with critical fail on the first 2 tries i start calling out the guy who is wiping the raid. In example i asked a gunslinger if she would be kind enough to stop WIPING half of the group and stop breaking the total opposite color he was supposed to break. It seems guns was a friend of raid leader cause the party switched him with other guy who broke the things correctly.    If i go with guildies we go untill we burn out apparently. Sometines you get an smooth run sometines it feels like prog. I like most of my guildies but some of them shouldn't be on the same clear group just to make things easier for everyone. Idk if i'm an asshole for thinking like this but having more than 2 people that can't do mechs properly generate a lot of stress for the group. The ones failing start to feel terrible and the ones who aren't failing mechs start wishing their pugged
🤦‍♂️ LA is a swamp filled with extreme narcissistic people… it’s so cringe that I don’t even know where it’s coming from.
Its still 50/50. Even if you go to extremes gatekeeping you may still get shat.   C'est la vie.
Seems like it
I believe at this point most hardcore players are running on statics or find players with discord and the lone wolf are just carrying Wales that can't fucking learn how to use sidereals
Valtan is horrible since people are leaving it for vykas clown brel just an horrible state atm
Wait people buy accounts? Wtf
People are going to buy and sell accounts because that's the easiest and fastest way to play on patch content. Let's say you buy an account for $500, play the content, and then you just sell the account for $500. You've basically paid nothing to play on patch content.
I got a 1540 sh who failed the swamp mech when trying to break out of gate 3 in a jail break for vykas.  I just pray that people are normal.
Clown pugs are usually jail.  Unless you're going with 1540+ juicers all around.
I haven't had a jail run in more than a month in EUC. Although that's probably cuz I make juicer lobbies and gatekeep on top of that.
The amount of high ILevel and Roster Level People who Still fail Mechs in Brel G2 and constantly Die is way to high. Makes me not looking forward to Brel HM at all
never accept valtan whales
G5 brel all 200roster+ PLC and they take turns fkng up actual canc gate
With every express event we get some new players. Also tons of veteran players create a new character that they can't really play yet.  It will get better again in the following weeks I think.
I dont do 5-6 anymore because of pugs, actually i dont pug raids anymore i been doing my runs with my guild and sometimes pug vykas with my 1530+s and yeah somehow i can still get jail.
The most efficient way of clearing all raids in a timely manner has always been joining a guild or forming a static. This will never change.  You say you barely have time for your raids but that's really on you. Pugs have always been hit and miss as you don't know the skill level of the 7 other people.
I haven't seen this until yesterday, interestingly enough. I was doing a "quick clown." Everyone was 1520ish, hell the support artist was LWC30. That's a super rare thing to see currently. I figured it'd be fine. We had a scrapper, Arti and sorc. Now, I figured I'd be the low man on the totem pole and we'd clear pretty quickly. Then we started to hit the add mechanic in G1 and found ourselves with the cars mechanic. I'm not an artist main and clown is always a pain in the dick to deal full damage on. He doesn't like to stand still long enough for me. This is relevant because I wound up with an almost 50% cruel fighter. Scrapper gets an upright and that sorc gets fighter. Okay, maybe a bad run, idk. We wipe once or twice in Gate 2 to accidental knockoffs. Shit happens, whatever. We clear it without too much stress. There I am with 40% cruel. We move to gate 3. Pick the Mario's without issue. Then the wipes start. Someone always dying after showtime. Then I notice that our clown turns after showtime sometimes hit 6. Now something is suspect. I double check the party members closer and see that the sorc is reflux. I think there's no way reflux is that bad. I've played with good reflux Sorcs and they still deal damage. Then I died to a failed stagger check. I decide to watch the sorc and see what's up. Literally watch this dude run around not killing balls and not casting anything. At all. The artist tricks the dude with a portal to a ball and pings the shit out of it for him to kill them. Finally the artist calls 2 more pulls and he's done. We wind up pushing through and getting into bingo the next run. Myself and the scrapper wound up doing the bingo and clearing. TIL you can 3 man buss in a pug and not get paid.
If you accept a 130+ roster level with a juiced character, for example 1500+ilvl for valtan, it's not gonna be a jail.  I know its a crazy requirement but if your character is juiced too, it's only fair. Most 1460 valtans I've encountered since Artist released, are jking jails. It triggers me.
How do you even sell an account? Asking for a friend
People join bad groups then blame the community. Seems really stupid but it really just comes down to joining competent groups. Which is really not a hard thing to do   Honestly, even if theres 1 player who "bought their account" in your group as long as everyone else is solid. There really would never be an issue with any current content
Pugs have such a wide spread. I find it really interesting. A lot of the times I’ve seen, players that always pug are some of the best. They are forced to learn all “positions” and have to really nail down mechs. Guild runs I tend to stick with what I know, there is usually one or two in discord calling out mechs which allows you to zone out without consequence and most runs are so juiced you just skip a lot of mechs.  It’s frustrating to get learning pugs but I’m always happy if they communicate and put in effort. I feel really bad for those that need to learn and just get constantly roasted. I don’t think purchasing an account has too much of an effect. That player still needs to learn at some point. Instead of sitting around being gated because they inspect poorly and never able to learn they have kicked open the gate with their wallet lol.  More and more higher tier players are going to be leaving the game eventually and if these newer players are never able to get their foot in the door that will just be a problem later on instead of now.
Not sure how you're finding yourself in these parties. I actually left my static for pugging and have been enjoying the hell out of the game. Way more consistent clears.
Yup...seems like all my pug groups leaves me in a jail
My pug groups are fine since Clown in NAW region, of course there is always bad runs or bad week too But the majority of the time its pretty fine on my side.   That said i do make my party every week and gatekeep sus people, i gatekeep hard in every raid, I don't gatekeep by class fyi as long as you are built properly I'll accept you even if you are a Reaper or Zerk. also if im gonna join parties i always check out the players in the lobby, like all of them cause I don't like any sneaking.  example was in 5-6 there was a group asking for a title, 2 of them was low roster and no title so instead of joining I created mine, peeps joined with PLC and that other group tried to join mine, i accept the 2 with PLC I suspect those guys are Chinese cause they can't speak English properly, well anyway they are trying to sneak in 2 no horn/title players they even had the gall to ask for the lobby lead too, I kicked them and saw them trying it to the other party, they got kicked again. Was pretty funny tbh.
If you see anyone with roster level <160 they will not know mech  However, if they have endgame titles, 5x3, all level 7 gems, and most importantly LOS18+, they are heavily playing the game and will most likely know mechs
The majority of LOA west players relied solely on bussing their gear. Once they are geared up they try raiding and fail a lot. Doesnt mean they bought their accounts.
Looking at my local groups I can get a PLC, Brel Hard ready acc for as low as 150-200$ and skip ALL the grind. Yep. These people are the ones who will terrorize your runs. So get ready everyone, theyre a lot more agents than you think.

Cheap tbh.
Yeah, the number of bought accounts is different for each region, and sooner than later each region will see this problem emerging.
I was in discord and my friend was doing a pug Vykas and they invited a 1590 Gunslinger all lvl 10 gems. He consistently lost to a 1540 DI Shadowhunter every gate and didn’t even make the family portrait. I thought it was really weird but that makes sense. People are just selling their accounts now.
How are people selling lost ark accounts? Are they selling the entire steam account?
Because buying an account is cheaper time and money-wise from a new and returning player's perspective. I myself sold mine, keeps me out from itching off my addiction.
Also there are many clueless alts with free 4x3 engravings
[removed]
Do these accounts come with other games on steam.
Pugs are better than my static runs lol
>we usually have kept some people around who are not amazing at the game  Me and a friend left a static mid Brel cause some bozos can't stay alive in G1-6, on top of that she as a support messed up a few times during prog and she got blamed by these bozo's zdps WHILE they themselves died an insane amount of times, that's a no for us.   Prog the rest of G6 in pugs so easily without them, felt so good cause in pugs while there are a lot of bad players there are a lot of pretty good players too. Feels good to not be always relied on to top dps, to do prokel, to do stars, to do m3.
Right, like if all your PUGs suck maybe you're the problem? I also left my static because I'd rather be angry at strangers then people I generally like. It's weird...
>Even Vykas 1500+ lobbies aren’t completely safe although they definitely minimize jailing probability.  Did 2 1500+ lobby vykas runs last night and almost got jailed in G2 in both of them. I think people depend too much their ilvl and got lazy with mechs.
For me too it's the opposite of what the OP said, I have been puging every content since valtan and it's true it has became worse at one point but I feel like recently it was getting a bit better. First week of artist release was horrible but that was for specific reasons. Especially if you wanted to do 1445 and 1460 content while also picking people that are on that lvl with all the free stuff (had a valtan hard lobby full lvl 1445 but people just couldn't survive up until the ghost phase even)
People join bad groups then blame the community. Seems really stupid but it really just comes down to joining competent groups. Which is really not a hard thing to do
I just did 2 1-6 Brels that were super clean pugs, we 1 shot all gates except g6, which was 2 pulls.  even had someone DC before g6, they never came back so we decided to just pull anyway and cleared it with 7.
Absolutely, like when I see a fully titled lobby fight with supports over diamonds in G3 or 1570+ sorc only using auto-attacks to break the orb in G4 yellow cube mech, that's what I mean with whales who bought accounts.
Target (not) Down.  I can only assume he wasted target down absent-mindedly right before the mechanic started, and shit himself when he realized it was on cooldown. If he doesn't do stars on other characters, he's probably used to Gunslinger pressing 1 button to basically instantly complete the mechanic without even moving.
It's more of a question of how you clear the content if the PUGs are diluted by bought accounts where you can't tell jailers from people who just want to do homework runs apart. I understand that the issue might not be as prevalent in your region and is not meant as a complaint (what can SG/AGS or the community do about it realistically), but rather: What is the best way to get the raids done quickly with minimal chance of getting jailed?
Yeah, I'll look for dc groups and hw statics, ty for the advice!
Pepperidge Farm remembers
Yup, that's the root problem I am trying to describe. The game is at a state where buying a juiced account is MUCH cheaper than swiping or even RMT, you get all the horizontal unlocked that you can't swipe for, and you get all the titles and a full roster. Now they terrorize all the PUGs and you can't tell who is legit or not and lose valuable time.
its very doubtful theres that many purchased accounts. more clowns are playing clown because valtan gold was nerfed.
If you always use discord for g2 clown it makes sense to need time to adjust to clock, first time for me was a bit weird
I feel ya, Vykas hm is a dumpster fire for PUGs rn.
Wait how is it possible to not have dmg for that. If wei hits top guy and the person waits just a sec before wei you can literally have dodo dmg on ilvl and kill it if people manage their meter.
Well for me is the opposite 1-6 are the most clueless ones
Well... My 1-6 yesterday wasn't able to do g5. It was overgeared PLC run.
True and real!
True, I'll keep that in mind for future PUGs XD
I feel your pain brother
Agreed, when your endgame consists of 18 legion raids a week and endless dailies people lose their patience easily, they imposed too much homework on the players, and gatekeeping is a result of that.
G1-4 is pretty free now even for pugs. The shit hits the fan at G5-6. This is also why several people I know only do G1-4 on all their characters because 5-6 is such a toss up even with titles and it’s not worth the extra gold to suffer hours of fails.  Even last week I was in a party with my bard and most the DPS were standard 1540+ 5x3 title lvl7 gems etc. Somehow our DPS was so lackluster that we were seeing the tornado mech and if that wasn’t enough, we got 3 separate sets of blue meteors when we were fighting her near the bottom. The last time that happened to me was on a prog party week 1-2.  I really believe that our DPS were just all running around dodging and thinking someone else will do damage.
I could say the same, I also PUG my full roster, didn't have any major problems but a month before it started to go downhill. What I'm trying to put down here is that the emerging problem of bought accounts is hitting hard in my region (US-W) and it might not be as bad in your region (yet). The game is at a state where buying a juiced account is MUCH cheaper than swiping or even RMT, you get all the horizontal unlocked that you can't swipe for, and you get all the titles and a full roster. Now they terrorize all the PUGs and you can't tell who is legit or not and lose valuable time.
100% this, get 2-3 homies and sell vykas, clown and brel 1-4, EUC thats extra 10k+ per character so 60k if you running just gold characters, then there are the vykas/clown books on nobid to share too, more rng gold. Personally do freebid on brels since good books are so rare there and 70% of the time even when listed as freebid we will get the book for 50g to split between us anyway.
I mean what do you expect, Chinese prime times is like 6 am for west coast, at that time people either pull an all-nighter or just work up and haven’t get their morning coffee yet. Unless you’re imply that Chinese player suck, but would be generalizing.
>what’s the difference between sitting hours and hours with a static to learn mechs vs doing the same with a pug?  You may or may not beat it in either instance.  I can explain at least this. Always pay attention to the expectations of the party. Some groups have high expectations, and are usually advertised in that way. "Reclear or HW" groups will not tolerate wipes because they were advertised for players who are experienced.  I agree with you though, it can be harsh. But if people have the expectation of clearing the raid in 30 minutes instead of 1 hour, that should be respected. Likewise, if a group is just a regular party trying to clear, they have less right to be angry or complain about wipes.      With a pug, you never know what you will get. But thats why we clearly label groups to set clear expectations before the run
Nothing against new players, I mean everybody was new at some point, right?  You’re right when it comes to players in Lost Ark having no chill, but the root problem stems from the devs themselves imposing too much homework on the players. As someone with a full roster, you have 18 legion raids a week to do on top of dailies. A lot of MMOs I have played are more new player friendly like FFXIV where mentoring is even incentivized, also they don’t have a large playtime around raids, they are more like theme-parks whereas LOA is purely raids and dailies end game to earn your bread and butter.   There is a huge difference between a static and a pug, a static forms when skill-wise some players are on the same level and want to clear efficiently, I had a static for my Brel runs on my main, we were clearing while chatting or watching videos since it’s all muscle memory and pattern recognition. A PUG has a title, where people have an agreement of minimal requirements for Lone Wolf players to join. The problem at hand here is that people with bought accounts don’t respect the lobby title, every MMORPG with high-end raids has descriptions in the party finder ranging from: Everybody Welcome to Try Party, Learning, Prog, EXP, Reclear, Homework Party, etc.   Lost Ark end game raids are unforgiving, one person can wipe the raid over and over, but a reclear/homework party expects you to know the mechs inside out, with minimal miscommunication and wipes. These bought accounts don’t respect the requirements since they have clear achievements and go into Homework parties abusing them as learning parties or prog parties, or even worse, hope for a free carry. The gate keeping is a result of people wanting to clear efficiently since they have so much to do and it will become worse and lead to even harder gate keeping requirements for all players to weed out these people.
Yes, most hardcore players are already in statics and/or bussing, time to adapt or get perma-jailed I guess...
Most of my toons in Valtan can basically clear GP by themselves so as long as most of them live til then I just carry the rest of the way...
The current state of the game is that buying an account is much more convenient and cost-efficient than starting on a fresh account, going through 50+ hours of first-time MSQ, building a roster and months of grinding horizontal content, and then swiping for ilevel, plus low roster accounts won't get accepted so new whales opt to buy second-hand accounts. It wasn't as much of a thing before since not many people wanted to sell but with a lot of people quitting the demand is getting filled.
New or returning whale and dont want to grind? Instead, you buy a quitting player's acc whos willing to be lowballed to get away from the game permanently and there you go.   PLC, ROSTER 180+, 401 SP, loads of 1500+ chars, level 9-10 gems, LOS 18/30. Playable out of the box and impossible to gatekeep until they enter the raid clueless as fuck.
I remember someone like that in vykas and the rest of us just told that person to “just stay deadge and get bussed”, because we just wanted to clear and it’s better without someone messing up the mechs.
RIP brother, that's the issue rn. There is no way to tell before the raid that you have an agent.
How stupid to sell a account that cheap
Compared to swiping 1500 Euros, it won't get you nearly as far as a second-hand account, and that's the scary thing, you get all the horizontal unlocked that you can't swipe for, and you get all the titles and a full roster. It's only gonna get worse because the more people sell the less they will cost. People think: Whatever, let them play their game until they terrorize your PUGs and you wonder why you can't finish your raids or spend double the time jailed in raids...
yes
People made a new steam account to play the game with the idea of selling it when they quit.
A lot of people that don't plan to play a game like LA (usually all mmorpg) will make a new account (steam or email) just so they can sell it later on.
yeah, there's a complete lack of a catchup and insane requirements  you have to do unrested 1560 chaos for almost 4 months to hit 1580 without external shards
How does it work selling your account though. You'd have to give the buyer your email login as well?!
Yes but at the same time if you're inviting or joining groups with people on engraving support then you're kinda inviting that evil into your life. It's not as though they're in disguise like account buyers.

Yep, this. One of my static member with 1540 ilevel deals the same damage as my 1490 sorc :(
Vykas runs are like a slider, DPS on one side, brains on the other. As you move the slider towards DPS, it gets further from brains.   G1 isn't too bad. G2 people won't stop firing stuns into the middle. G3 is when all hell breaks loose. I guess when defeating the boss is a forgone conclusion, everyone changes their priorities to getting MVP. This encourages greedy, risky play that results in wipes.
Sometimes you run into partial guild runs where people are trolling each other too. Fortunately, g2 doesn't require very many people alive, provided you're willing to time stop for the ball mechanic.
Ah yes, let me just determine which of these groups of complete strangers is competent before joining real quick.
No idea why DPS would even want diamonds, cubes are just diamonds with more time to clear for a DPS since the tiny amount of increased HP isn't really relevant. They're kinda making their own lives harder, at that point.
This is why we will have to gate keep with brel hard pet aka 5 clears and 10 its sad but I would rather have a legit run than risk being jailed because someone bought his way into the content
It’s a lot more risky for class like summoner or arti to do square, I don’t blame them if they want diamond. Also support like paladin having much easier time doing square than diamond.
Bare with me a bit of long context   I can't tell why but one thing for sure I didn't see him use the skill where the gs sits on the ground and shoot idk what it's called snipe or like you said target down, and asked if he needed innana said no need but he still got hit by every eye and I was like that's really strange thankfully the other guy was cube so 4 of were alive and finished it   and on G4 I asked him what you prefer kill or catch or stagger he said kill but the guy took 5 sec to kill we almost failed the stagger so I told him just catch the next time I'll kill he catches it and didn't move for a bit until someone pinged him aside from mech the guy was good at pattren he was just bad at mechs tbh.
There is no magic answer to this, you either find a static or try to arrange adhoc homework runs within your guild.
Sorry, DC/HW?
Yeah... sounds difficult for AGS to ban, too, since they can just say "I moved"  More reason that linking it to actual national IDs would've been nice like Korea does
Someone these clowns think every shitter they encounter bought their accounts lol   No, people are just bad at the game.   Theres not even enough accounts for sale to supply all the bad folks i have to carry in pugs every week since release.
Before, my go to insult was "stop buying busses", now I think "how much for the account?" is my new thing now.
NAW moment
I’m afraid I am, not saying all of them are bad but during prime time when it’s obvious judging by their igns runs rarely go smoothly. Can’t blame much since we know why NA West is so rampant with bots and RMT.
I remember something like that too, group ultimately ended up disbanding, was this normal vykas last week or week before?
Supply and demand. Lot more people quitting than starting the game. But yes it's insanely cheap compared to other games.
If it is from a 3rd world country, 200$ is like a month's minimum wage salary, so not entirely impossible.
If you're quitting, any money you get out of quitting is fine. The alternative is either you let the account sit there forever without purpose, or you mark it higher and then it would never sell because why would anyone buy expensive accounts when ones much cheaper exist.
cheap accs usually heavily botted but since la don't ban no one cares
Well the time/cost of generating that account with bots is probably very low.
This is pretty normal tbh if you are familiar with account selling within p2w games. So I have some friend who plays chinese wuxia MMOs, if he feels like to return to the game he will simply buy an account with \~20k usd, and sell the account with a little bit less when he quits some months later. The account he bought will cost you like 500k usd if you start from absolute scratch。  Also, the more p2w a game is, the more ridicule the price difference will be.
Damn. Guess if people made a dummy steam account just for lost ark then it makes sense. I can't imagine ditching my steam account whenever I quit though. I don't even have a big game library but my account is old AF. Would bother me too much to make a new one
dummy lost ark email for steam, it's a different story tho if its your main steam acc.
Somehow certain people manage to join competent groups each week. Almost like being able to inspect a group is a skill in itself.
I actually enjoy squares more on my Pally since I can take out 2 with one skill.
People definitely won't bus/get piloted for Brel 5-6 HM just like they did every other piece of content, that'd be crazy.
I love doing squares on my summoner, I just ww grenade the first and auto attack the other two. Always works.
Nah, Arti flamethrowers first two squares and uses enhanced shell/forward barrage/swing/napalm shot for third
Weird, definitely seems like he put target down on cooldown before shapes, otherwise I can't imagine why he wouldn't use it. The fourth shot is a guaranteed kill, the other three will kill in one hit if they crit. Since PM's critical hit chance is so high, it's extremely unlikely that TD won't clear all three stars within a few seconds. Pretty much TD, cursor on star, shot 1, cursor on star, shot 2, cursor on star, shot 3. Done. If any don't crit, you have another shot to finish the job. You're also immune to knock back for the entire thing, so don't need sidereal.  Sounds like overall just a sketchy player who's either not focused or pretty clueless.
HW = Homework, lingo from Korea where it basically means you're looking for experienced players for a quick reclear.  not sure what DC means here, Discord?
Last week was literally the first time I had people THAT bad at clown in the last 4 months. Sure there are shitters but if they're 1540+ there's literally not enough time for them to make that many mistakes.
Hard vykas a couple months ago haha. I guess this happens pretty frequently, unfortunately.
how do u bot honing? like you can't get a brel hard ready account just by botting.
but if your lost ark wasnt bound to steam, you would?   those ppl planned ahead. now you also know for your next game
Inspecting doesn’t tell you if someone is good. Titles mean nothing, gear/ilvl means nothing, having the right engravings and gems doesn’t mean you know how to play. Bussing means there’s literally zero way to determine if a player is competent pre-fight.  I didn’t say I had problems, all I said was you can’t tell if people are competent without actually being in the fight.  People saying that every pf they ever join is competent are bullshitting unless they exclusively join 1560+ parties that skip every single mechanic that needs bodies.
Would've loved to have you in my run earlier where the two paladins were SHOCKED that they were asked to do cubes and unironically asked me "If I wanted to wipe on shapes that hard".  In the end we reshuffled so I had cubes, and I watched one of the palas do diamonds with executor's + light of justice one, then auto the other two.  My mind was fried after that, honestly
Yes, discord groups.
Theyve just been useless afk vykas durdles
They botted since release  Like i know some people that have been botting dailies since argos and they still arent banned  Dailies everyday is enough to get to current content
planning ahead? selling an account is a regret not an investment. $200 for a 2k hours HMBrel ready account (according to another comment) is global poverty wages. they can have it
>now you also know for your next game  Imagine playing games like this
Seems like you just don't know how to pick out good groups
yeah but u still need raw gold going from 1445 to 1490 atm is over 100k raw gold atm that doesn't include mats yeah u can bot the mats in chaos but what about the oreha going 1490 to 1540 would still take a lot of gold and time to get the brel horns and 200k gold atm is already like $60 on g2g so selling a brel hard account for $200 is kinda far fetched.
I think it’s the idea that most games have a shelf life.  If you had fun for a decent portion of those hours and now just want to recoup a bit it’s not bad at all.  Also some people when they want to quit need to make sure they quit I guess.
It's something...u can either get nothing and let the account rot or get a few bucks back and move on to another game. I've sold my old mmo accounts before and while it's sad to never be able to go back it's a whole lot better than leaving and getting nothing back.
> not an investment.  Sure.   But if you don't want to play then selling is better than not selling.
Nah you can sell brel ready for way more than $200, and if you are quitting it's a free 1k anyways. Its only a regret if you arent actually moving on.
Its only a regret if u come back to the game
That's a lot of Vietnamese Dong and Philippines Pesos FYI.
This is not a standard price pretty sure. They're closer to 1k usd and above generally. That is still strictly less than you would need to spend on a fresh account to get there. And comes with the perk of skipping all horizontal and raid progression.
Having options available. Don’t see anything wrong with that. I sold my older gameboy games 🧐
isn't this what most people do?  they play games, and once they are done, they sell it. I mean it's like Gamestops whole business model.
I've plugged since release since my schedule is too unpredictable for any static.   There's definitely less reliable groups to pick from. My suspicion is they all found statics of their own or quit.
I mean they still play the account  They bot dailies while at work > come back from work and raid
I don't know if you know this, but the chaos dungeon exchange gives a ridiculous amount of solars on a weekly limit. (Not roster limit, weekly) that's a lot of juice mats you can get for free if you bot chaos dungeons
That's selling access to the media, not the literal progress. I find account selling incredibly odd.
Then you are just odd, if everyone in the room is the odd one, you are the odd one.
Average redditor thinking they are the majority. Never in my life have I met someone who create a new account for every online game they play, that's basement dweller behavior.
gold deletion vendor
Believe it or not, you got the most likely result twice in a row.
Some people might not like this but after i get green i just dont tap anymore
Most dumb system
F
this and stones. building a character is legit a horrible experience, i don't recommend this game at all to new players
you gave up too early, next tap could have hit fosho
I dread the weapon quality taps. For my Glavier, It took me from the moment of her release up until a week ago to finally get to the quality I wanted on the weapon without mass spending gold on chaos stones.
Saintone said it best, quality upgrade is a scam
my soulfist all purple meanwhile my main tryhard stuck on blues
I feel it. After 28 tries i went from 58 to 59 on my launcher. I just skipped a week after that.
At least your out of 59 hell!
I hope there are pity systems on all of these dumb shit
And thats why i quit this game.
skill issue
Every tap should succeed tbh. So if unlucky you will slowly increase to max by incremental of *1*
Thats the nature of the beast, even we deny it, we just love the rush of gambling.
Ya with the new system you can just dump 200 stones and 100k gold into a weapon upgrade in like half a minute without getting anything
My condolences
L
Honestly at that point I would rather lose quality that go up by one
Anyone that played lineage 1 or 2 among others back in the day knows the soul crushing despair Korean mmo upgrade systems bring. I stay away from them because it gets too depressing.
This is gambling, if gambling affects you then you stop, alt+f4 or whatever to stop suffering.  If this bad feeling persist just quit, come back if u feel like.
Shame such a good game is stuck behind shit systems
How did you managed to get the recording of my gameplay from yesterday.
Sad thing there is no pity for quality
Started at 0 quality and then went to 1. I stopped quality upgrades for now
[removed]
Thank you for your service, SF ult just went from there to 93
End game
I tapped 28k on my glaives weapon yesterday. Went from a whopping 66 to 66. burned 28k for literal 0 gain in under a minute
One day people will understand the quality upgrade percentages lmao
Most likely result meaning what? Just because it's the highest individual percentage doesn't mean it's the most likely result. The sum of the probability of all qualities 61+ far exceeds the probability of JUST 59/60. Most people who tap quality will get larger than +1.
Depends where your money's at. I stop at blue
bUT kR vETs sAY iTs betTer tHaN rE-craFTIn aNd roLLin AgaiN!  same, i dont do it after 50%
Cards are the worst don’t @ me
especially people with addiction issues.
Idk building a character is pretty fun when u don’t forget its a MMO and don’t try to push 20 characters equally. It takes time to have a good char and thats good or better said like in every other MMO
Just one more tap.... just. one. more. tap.
Half the ways to improve in this game are a scam. We were pitched a game where it was more friendly because enhancing had pity, now I wish to go back to a game where enhancing was all the annoying rng I had to deal with  compared to the current enhancing (getting to pity still sucks), getting a good stone, bracelet, quality, card set, soon to be elixir, and so on.
The rng in this game is dumb. I know logically that every account does not have seeded rng … but then there is this  1. All 6 of my gold earners have 92-99 quality weapons in less than 10 taps  2. 2/6 have all purple quality with just legion raid mat conversions  3. I pity almost every single piece of armor and pitied 17, 18, 19, and 20 on my first brel weapon  4. I have had 7 relic maps from south vern  But  I am 23 cards from los30 because I have pulled a god aweful near 50 Wei’s. No large gold bars. No 9/7.  A single person in my guild never sees more than 30% artisan. They get 100k+ gold in accessory drops weekly. They have 2 9/7 stones on their account. Both in less than 10 tries just trying to get a 7/7.  Its things like this that make confirmation bias a thing 🤣
Who the fuck is “we” lmao
No, fuck that.  Give me an option to pay a flat amount or gamble and I'll never choose to gamble.

next tap has to hit
Studies show that 70% of gamblers stop right before hitting it big
i've been stuck at 66 or 67 on my weapon for 3 chars since basically the start of relic gear. it's sucks
I was hardstuck at 65 for the longest time. Recreated and got a 85q in about 10k gold.
And this is why I will never chase high quality on any character. These RNG systems are so bs. I am fine with 50 or higher quality when that rolls.
Not with how it's presented in game, people will never understand how it works unless they do external research.
But it is weighted towards the lowest quality right? So of all the possible numbers to hit, the individual lowest number has the highest probability.
I understand what you're trying to say but it doesn't really matter in that sense. it has to be a single quality, and you could say the same about every single quality going from 59 to 100. that single quality is still lower chance than getting "any other quality". so it doesn't really matter if you say it like that. when he says it's the most likely result, it still is the most likely single result compared to all of the rest as a single result
cards are basically gacha which is cancer
I'm in this comment and i don't like it  have an upvote
i agree for alts and huge rosters, or even just gold earning alts. but like i said in my comment: if i were a new player with no characters? making my main? trying to gear myself to get into lobbies? with these systems? and the way this community gate keeps in party finder? bro.  like ok, honing can suck but at least you're just filling up a mats bar with each tap that's guaranteed to hit. with a small chance to succeed.  but then this new player, on their fresh main, runs into these other systems one by one on their way to trying out valtan for the first time? that just sucks
Getting passable results is easy. Getting good will be of course hard.  IE: 6/7 stones, spec/crit 1 line bracelets, 50-60 quality, lwc12 or los18. Etc.
At least your gear doesn't get deleted if it fails like in metin 2
Seems bullseye someone's  sweet spot..xd
Same here, it makes absolutely no sense that my 70 quality weapon doesnt even have 3% chance to upgrade. Worst system imaginable
Yeah and then the freaking bard gets a 85 default
My arcana had 69 weapon since July. I’ve been tapping for months and nothing, until couple weeks ago it went to 96. So hang in there
Yes... the highest individual probability, but if you had 100 people tap a piece of gear with 59 qual until one success and then polled them on what it turned into maybe 10 people will have 60 qual. The other 90 will have higher. Those 10 people are the largest amount of people on a singular number, maybe there is 9 people on 61, 8 people on 62, but at the end of the day the VAST majority of people are not at 60 qual.  Made up numbers but the the point is the same.
Laughs in zinnervale
you get cards free in card runs though
The main issue I have is variance is too high. You can get a useable or good stone in a few tries, or you can be doomed for an extended amount of attempts cutting 5+ Malus rocks or other garbage like that. For players that have been around a while, sure, we can recover much faster. For new players if you have a stone cutting session like that and lose all your Pheon, I wouldn’t blame you if you logged off and never came back.
The problem is almost entirely the community. It is remarkably easy to get the level of power that the *game* expects of you. The systems mostly become irritating when going for the super high end min-max stuff that is in no way required by the game itself.  Also the only of these systems a new player would be dealing with is the rock, and the rock is basically free if you aren’t going for 7/7 or higher (which a new player shouldn’t be). (Edit: frankly almost no one should be farming rocks that high and complaining about it since you don’t need it for 5x3 but here we are.)
Regardless of my thoughts on the logic of “it’s ok to be the type of person people gatekeep!” Why do people still encourage lwc 12 anyway? Wasn’t the new free dps set stronger
You're dragging your balls through broken glass, but at least it's not lava!
I’m manually deleting my ability stones and bracelets and accessories that roll like crap, so I don’t think it’s a huge difference.  Gear doesn’t auto break because they’d have to build the game completely different. Could you imagine someone playing for 20 years and never getting to Brel Normal because of bad luck had them start over at the first chaos dungeon? No (decent) game is like that, most Korean games have a level where gear doesn’t break and just ask for that for most content, with higher gear making it much easier
Seems you're stupid xd
If they at least weighed it a little bit higher towards upper Blue Quality and made Purple or 100 much much lower it would make more sense. Right now if you have bad RNG that 65-70% Quality area is actual jail.
this literally happened to me...
So exactly what he said. The most likely result twice in a row.
This is such a statistical fallacy. You cannot compare and group a sample size that has varying amounts of trials AND outcomes.  The highest mode will still be +1. Your comments are just a big fat nothing burger. But, enjoy your updoots!
How to burn out in one easy step. Do card runs on all your alts
Yeah … I have done full card runs are 7 characters for the last 9 weeks … not a single card. Not one. Up to Yorn, Oreha, and Argos. 9 weeks now. None. Don’t even get cards from Legion raids.  Card runs are an absolute lie.
Dude I have 7 characters brel hm ready and I'm about to quit from this stone cutting experience. My last 7/7 was when summoner was released. I'm like 600 pheons deep and the best I cut was a 6/7. I can't imagine being a new player. I fucking hate rocks.
Its only good on a couple of classes (lwc12). Or if you don’t take crit syns.
No it’s dependent on class and build (at least when comparing to DD18). There are classes that still benefit from crit rate more than %damage, particularly those with additional %damage modifiers in their relic sets or those who rely on %crit damage for their damage output such as some KBW users or classes with massive crit damage in their kits.  DD30 may not have these cases at all I have not run any numbers on it but DD18 is not strictly better
It's not the most likely result tho.  He literally explained it to you.
Depends on how you define result, and arguing definitions can just as well be used the other way. A more likely result is him not getting exactly +1.
You absolutely should group because nobody is aiming for a SPECIFIC number (other than 100, but even then most people will settle for a 99). Nobody cares what the mode is, they care what the average is. Or the chance of getting 70+, or 80+. The chance of SPECIFICALLY 60 is such unbelievably worthless information.
so how many dungeon mats do you have in your inventory?
The most probable single number to hit on a success is the lowest number possible. Exactly what the op said. I don't know why you need to change the definitions. The result isnt a range of numbers. And each individual number doesn't have the same probability to hit. So why lump them together?
But you cant define it as different ranges. Would you say 65-70, 70-75 etc. or just any random number above what you have except from +1 ? That doesn't make any sense at all.
Am I a joke to you?     Don't forget those of us that earnestly desired a 69 weapon and would have settled for it. That's how I went 55-100 lmao
Since the majority of players will get 60 before getting 70 and 70 before getting 80? But yeah lets ignore stats. Or pretend to know stats and fail miserably ;)
On one of the toons, I have 325 argos blood. Typically delete everything else.  As another point of reference of massive card rng. I am a founders 3 day early release player (for play time context). I have been running 6 Valtans weekly since it released. I have 3 Valtan cards.   So yeah. Card drops are a lie. Most of the folks I play with are done with all the necessary card sets (laz, umar, lec, los) … me … nah. I am almost done with Destined Encounter. And that isn’t from card run drops. Thats from all the F4 packs.
These guys are just being contrarian. If the first guy had said, "OP you had a really unlikely outcome" they would have disagreed as well saying, "actually these were the most likely individual outcomes" they just wanna disagree if they can find some angle to reframe the comment to be wrong.
My scrapper has a +69 weap. On one hand, nice. on the other hand, not blue.  So torn.
If you want to choose to be literal rather than meaningful than sure I guess that means were ignoring stats. Imagine rolling a 6 sided die that lands on 3 and saying "that's the most likely outcome". Well the likelihood of each outcome is 16.6% and no other outcomes are more likely so it is the most. How insanely meaningless is that statement. That is really no different than this.
It's an insanely meaningless comparison is what it is.

Congrats waiting for gf to reach brel also.       Ohh wait i have no gf...
Congrats mr husband!
Congrats! I'm still waiting for my boyfriend to hit 1475 on his artist. Can't wait to do brel with him later on as well.
congrats!! pay no attention to these people nitpicking his build! just do you and keep having fun together :)  see you in brelshaza!
shouldve gotten a bracelet as soon as he hit 1490
gz hf
Grats
Gz to your husband dear :)
Hi, congrats on the achievement. A quick tip, incase you are playing with raid captain, the movement speed from mayhem and from swiftness are overcapping the raid captain dmg. Therefore I would lower the amount of swift to ~830 and move the rest to crit.
not trying to ruin the mood but please tell him to work on re-spec his stat, he should have more crit (1300+) and lowering his swift (800~900)
Congrats on the push! I always love reading these types of posts. I hate to be -that guy- but I am afraid your partner may be getting gatekept from brel.. his stats are completely incorrect and most people care about stats over engravings. I am writing this because as a berserker enjoyer I know what its like to be perma-denied (even with the dps shortage) and hope he doesn't experience the gatekeeping too much..    There is a great community guide for berserker that shows the full breakdown on how to build and play the class optimally to get the most amount of damage off. Best of luck!
congrats
Congrats  You two’s first experience in Brel is gonna be fun
Stats are really Bad  You should AIM for 1400 crit and 850 Swift.
he coulda been 1560+ if he didnt have a wife
Imagine not hiding how much time you waste on this game from your wife. Couldn't be me.
How many swipes later?
[removed]
[removed]
i thought mayhem depend on crit?
Congrats. Enjoy gaming together.
Welcome to the club
Congrats but that’s.. too much swiftness. For now peak swift is 874 with Raid Captain
4k monitor and literally cannot read the words lol
Debussy is going to be pretty angry when she hears that
pls tell me you play gunlancer then
I have been captured by brelshaza (now normal but soon hard mode) could you help me please... I can't seem to quit that clear.... And I'm not even a support... When there was the frog guy they made me clear frog guy with 10 different parties 3 times each for some reason.... Pleass help me I'm tired.    Not even a support btw   Edit; Forgot to mention about which brel anc correct spelling mistakes..
He just honed from 1480-1500 just now 🙂
Okay thank you! I’ll let him know. We’ve been following the max roll guide for a while and just found the community guide about a week ago 🫣 he’s looking into reworking it now!
It's funny that this was the first thing I noticed too... We're even gatekeeping the achievement posts LMAO
Thank you so much! We’ve been following maxroll for a while lol. We just found the community guide last week! He’s working on changing it now 🙂
Why so negative 😂
![gif](giphy|eU2sRBEme4GIM)
I know this is dumb but I still laughed
Imagine hiding from your wife

This might be a stupid question but is the only way to up number is to increase to quality of the accessories and replace a swiftness accessory?
Yeah, only after posting i've realized resolution is kinda shit xD
you need some glasses more pixels bro
Unfortunately no. :< Planning to try and get one of every class, but haven't hit the warriors yet besides a bonk bonk. 14 characters on roster so far.
Small tip, doing the first two gates of brelshaza the first time will give you enough materials to craft a brel relic armor, which after transfer and honing once, will give you a 5 ilvl increase, so a lot of people will stop honing at 1495 and transfer once to hit 1500. Its generally more expensive to hone past 1490 with regular relic gear  Edit: the comment below gives a better breakdown
The truth isn't inherently negative. with that much swiftness he overcaps on atk speed and move speed. Other Zerkers are playing with the same atk and move speed, because it caps out at 40% bonus while having 1500+ in crit stat. that's 600 points worth of stats not in use and 600 is a lot.
I wouldn't say he's being negative. It's just the truth. Assuming your husband is playing Mayhem Berserker and it looks like it since he's going Crit and Swiftness, he should aim for the amount the person above said. Mine is 1574 Crit and 800 Swiftness and the benefit is 100% Crit chance for back attack skills, 90% for non-positional ones after using fully leveled Chain Sword or Red Dust. 874 Swiftness is actually the exact number needed to cap move speed with level 2 Yearning for max efficiency Raid Captain engraving
Negative? He is Entering lategame and so He has to know how his class works and what stats he needs. Im a Zerker myself but i would Not accept your husband in any raid because it shows clearly he doesnt care about his build and has probably an equal knowlage about rotations and tripots.
 ?? How is that negative?  Taking advice on obviously bad Stat distribution as negative is ridiculous.
Imagine having a wife
What does any of this matter? It’s just a question. So piss off.
To increase your stats you need to increase Quality of your accessories. For Berzerker I recommend playing with Crit/Swift Necklace + 2 crits ring + 1 crit earring + 1 swiftness Earring + Swift/Crit Bracelet.  That would allow your husband to get 874 swiftness (don’t need to aim for more but definitely not less than that) and way more crits
Kind of is an understatement
how do you manage to fuck up the resolution like that
Personally, I'd only hone to 1490, get gloves (assuming DPS) and hone them to 16.  Two pieces to 21:  * 12.5K Gold * 119K Shards * 560 Blue Oreha * 27K Basic Blues * 769 GHL  This effectively saves you (two pieces no longer need to be honed from 12 to 13):  * 6.3K Gold * 67K Shards * 67 Purple Oreha * 5.1K Advanced Blues * 147 MHL  Which means at the end of the day, after transfer, you lost the following expected materials:  * 6.2K Gold * 52K Shards * ~400-450 fusion matts, it's a pretty big rip, even accounting for purples saved being worth more. * Blues not bad, depending on server prices. Overall a loss but not much. * 622 GHL  On the other hand, if you just hone your gloves to 16 from transfer:  * 24.7K Gold * 228k Shards * 290 Purple Oreha * 20K higher tier blues * 526 MHL  It costs more, but this is permanent progress that you'll need to do sooner or later anyway. You're closer to 1520 (you can +16 three pieces) and 1540. Throwing away 50K shards, ~15K gold and that many leaps (assuming you don't have a ton of bound GHLs as you honed when you could) is not a great idea if you can avoid it.  Another option of course for a slow character is to do 1-2 on week 2, then 1-2 on week 3. Buy two boxes (you'll have 30/40 after the third week before boxes) and create a second piece, allowing you to do 3-4 after the 1-2 on the third week.
Taking ~40 stats at 1% dmg that's ~15% dmg lost. Best case   ONLY 10%....
You're a perfect example of why I'll never play this game.
Yep getting "gatekept" here at least you know why and what to work on  In game you just get denied and never knowing why
Imagine imagining
Way to play the victim after an obvious attempt to discredit the accomplishment.  "Just a question" my ass.
Noted - makes sense itll cost less overall by not pushing to +21 pre brel, i think the incentive is to be able to smoothly do 1-4 brel right away without taking a long pause in the middle to hone.
Yep, +21 was good on brel release when new mats were expensive, but nowadays it's easier to just hone to +16. Especially during first week of artist when GHL literally cost more than MHL.
ty i just hit 1490 and learning clown rn, this will help a lot going for brel on the weekend
good lmao
thanks for not playing the game
Great, now also leave the sub of a game u never played.
damn we cannot be more grateful that you dont play the game.
Imagine all the people..
Who said swiping is discrediting?
Funnily enough, for me it was Soulfist too. EO though.       I really enjoy the general playstyle but the Hype management irks me a bit. Going into Hype 3 and having the boss just go untargetable or similar just doesn't feel good.          I think I realized that I don't enjoy playing her too much when I reached 1460, shortly before Clown released.       Although due to various different circumstances she's now 1540..
Shock scrapper.  She's just *so* slow, and completely depends on back attacks on top of that.
Found my Arti very awkward when I made him bc of the “hit buttons then wait three second to hit” mechanism.  Was going to bench him after making his relic set, and he crafts a 100 quality launcher.  Now he’s in my main 6.
Most classes to be honest... the trixion tutorial was all I had to work with back then. The class tester at the very start needs to be updated with both engravings for every class equipped with the most popular end game build aswell as their stats and a summon boss scarecrow option.  Why must I atleast finish vern to somewhat try a class? I say somewhat because again, trixion and a raid are 2 different things.  To answer the topic though, my main being scrapper, the green/yellow resource intimidated me then I realised I was an idiot once I actually tried it.
Machinist;  I didn’t like getting the drone positioning mechanics  that made aiming the abilities a little awkward but I watched a video that told me to use my z key to reposition constantly which eventually led to me playing the character a lot more
gunslinger Peacemaker going from pistols into rifle back to pistols to shotgun all in constant rotation and the early raids were hard in oreha 1 hit usually kill her i suffer a lot but now she is one of my favorite alts and no longer dies to one hit the relic gear fix most of the problems and me getting better
Arcana for sure. When I tried her out I really liked the feel, but once I finally got a good understanding of playing around the card RNG properly and managing all those moving parts... She just feels exausting, I never feel like I'm performing well because there's always something not going my way.         Gunslinger on the other hand I expected would always feel awkward, but after having her for a while she became very smooth to play. The learning curve was like learning to drive a manual, once I got used to it there was no friction at all.
DB Striker. I play full AM roster and Striker is my last gold earner i tried (in fact reaper was last, but i did know that i will make reaper when i saw her first time in november or sth like that). He is so fucking slow, his abilities are some strange mix of instacast and lock in one place shit. He slaps hard with 2 or 3 skills and rest is like nothing... Overall i really like him, he is my only one "burst" class in roster and i like his numbers, but first couple of days was... Problematic.
Honestly RS only feels good with full tripods and gems.  After that investment she deletes everything lol
Took me a while to understand arcana, after several months im still scratching the surface.
CO Summoner  I spammed like crazy. Spammed pet’s attack and moved them to dodge boss pattern. 10+ clicks passed and nothing happened on my screen. No visual nor sound effects, just a pet subtly rolling for that much apm.
Emperor arcana- it looked so easy when watching others play it. But when i tried it, its actually quite tedious and difficult to play.  Its like watching anime with subtitles. Constantly having to look up and down at ur skill placement, boss patterns, your card draws, managing mana, changing rotation to include card buffs. Nevertheless its fun.
Surge DB, I thought it would be amazing damage and i was not wrong, but the playstyle of building stacks..... let me tell ya, if you go with juicers you won't ever get 20 stacks before the boss changes phases, you'll have to use it as soon as you get 12 stacks if your teammates are too strong which subsequently cucks you from 8% atk power and 48% dmg on surge if my calculations ain't wrong and ALSO you getway less orb meter to rely on
Reaper
Gunslinger too hard for me to play straight up
Striker without proper spec and tripods. Did not want to go eso. It was really fun getting upgrades, though. You can feel every point of spec you get.
ESO Wardancer i love the playstyle but the class being really clunky and locking you into do you have these things then you can do your rotation feels really bad. But normally it's do you have 3 bubbles, into will I have mana for my rotation, into will my moonflash kick be off cd when my windgod cast animation is over, into will the boss disappear if I cast my wind whisper into will my blast formation animation lock me and get knocked down using up my orbs while doing literally nothing because the skill does it's DMG only after it completely finishes it's full animation or is the target to small that the skill literally misses it because it has to travel forward and then start doing dmg. Oh another clunky thing if you use moonflash kick and the boss has decided that it needs to move a hairline well now you didn't generate your orbs you needed so you could use your other spender.   Yeah Wardancer is a whole lot of clunky. I still love it but oh man do I wish they could just fix any of these things.
First i was playing re deathblade from maxroll. I decided switch to surge from community guide. What can go wrong? Almost the same skills, the same stats... Jesus christ the tripods completly changed the skills I was used to and I was like a child in the fog. Torally diffrent class. Much slower to re what surprised me. Now after 3-4 weeks Im ok with her but was expecting smoother transition.
Reaper. Despite me being a swiftness andy with most of my preferred classes being the raid captain or max swift variety, Reaper's mobility took me by surprise even then, so many skills have micro movements, and that's disregarding the outright teleport they have.
When I first started playing this game I mained a Deathblade. I was 100% sold on her visuals and concept, but levelling her was pretty boring.  Despite initial impressions, she has a somewhat slow playstyle since all of her big damage moves are "hold" or "charge" attacks where she's just sitting there preparing her big kamehameha move for 2 anime episodes.  I didn't think playing Deathblade would involve standing still while being locked into an animation 75% of the time.  What saved the class for me was Surge. The whole building stacks into a big Surge bomb makes her really fun to play, but I find most of her base kit not that fun on its own.
Gunlancer alt...
Hype management on EO SF. Thought the full swift would be no brainer, was a lot more work than expected
FI Wardancer feels much less rewarding than eso.
Artist, i made her but didnt even try her due to the lack of dps at taht time.
Wardancer 4 spender halu, made one with the last powerpass, toyed a bit with 3 spender and swapped to 4, I don't know why but i can't make the rotation work in real combat, i have the spec and wealth runes but i seems to never have enough gauge generation to use it properly.  On trixion is fine, but in a raid there is something not working for me and I don't get what it is
I still have nightmares about trying to make Deathblade work in T2 Guardian Raids/Abyssal Dungeons without enough skill points or good galewind runes when I first started.    She was my main at the time and it was a fairly significant factor in deciding to stop playing not too long after launch.
definitely barrage artillerist. he does so much damage but I just hated playing him.   also red gunlancer. I used to main blue but I tried red and its just a bit awkward because the taunt window is just a bit too short to get SC and CS off in time
Barrage Artillerist. Everything from lack of meter tripods to positioning issues because boss said bye to the other side of the map xD  And same experience with soulfist. But for me it depends tons on the raid, Brel is awesome with her.  And my main, WD. play her since release and yeeah that means t1-early t3 with 0 gear. Man was it a clunky experience. Only reason I kept at it back then was because of my nerd friends salivating over big crit buffs and future promises from korean players.
Think mine was GT destroyer.  Bonk bonk for days, but damage and playstyle were awkward from what I thought it was.  Was prepped to bench the class, but stupid guy kept 1-2 tapping all his gear so I reluctantly kept him in.  After 1445 swapped build to RH and went 'oh...that's how he works..'
Must say soulfist too.  Robust in argos days was a Mess 😂😂 Switched eo when valtan came. Did not rly like that.  At brel i made her new 5x3 robust 17xx spec and now she is my main dps char 😄  She shines in later game with good gems and high spec.
The trick to enjoying soulfist as an alt, is switching to RS. Atleast that was my path.
Came here to say EO SF as well.
I second having an RS build solely for doing reclear homework raids. EO hype management kinda feels shitty when the boss is just going from phase to phase. Half the time I need to just skip hype 2 entirely so I can get some damage in, vykas g3 is especially bad about this.
Same, although she is in my gold roster. Fun to play, hype irks, pushing her to 1540 due to circumstances involving her insane luck. Plus she got max tripods from back when it was easy to get with the big tripod change. Which means: Way too much of a waste to bench x.x  That's why I decided to roll up my sleeves, do some research, ask great soulfist players for advice and just practice tons.
I parked my shock scrapper at Brel release for the same reason.  I just rebuilt her this week as Tai and it's so much more fun. I love my scrapper again!  Getting a whole new set of tripods is gonna suck tho.
lol my main was a 1560 tai scrapper main. I have a 1540 shock scrapper alt. I had a vision of 1800 spec main with perfect gems. And made the switch. 1800 spec, perfect gems amazing damaged. But, I miss the taijutsu style of play, it’s so fun. I say as an ex Tai main, don’t switch unless you really want to.
Yeah, Homing barrage takes 3 business days to land
This is my single biggest gripe with the game. Why on earth does it give you such shocking previews of characters you are about to spend literally thousands of hours on.
A trick for this is to alternate drone and joint skills. Since it summons your drone back too you as well.
If u are iron man,it wont matter that much. At on the other hand def needs that,but still, u just call back your drone everytime u use blue or yellow. For purple,u call them back anyway
I hated my Gunslinger for a long time for this exact reason and ended up using the previous hyper express on it. Hit a few quality upgrades, felt a lot better, and now it's 1550...
Same feeling when playing empress, optimisation pending on what set of cards you have and what detonator puts quite a bit of brain drain. In comparison emperor is pretty smooth on decision making as your rotation doesn't change all that much all things considered and likely biggest card choice is holding clown for specific combo or if you want to Wheel of Fortune evoke or resurrection
To be fair if you're with juicers like that and the boss is getting destroyed that fast your class doesn't even really matter at that point.
Lunar I guess?  I don't think there's anything smoother than Hunger Reaper
Gunslinger is more intimidating than hard, the rotations are pretty fixed and the long cooldowns means that once you get used to it it'll just go smoothly. It's still harder than most others and I still change to the wrong stance every now and then but since shotgun and sniper have different keys (QWER vs ASDF) it ends up not being that big of a deal (unless it happens often ofc)  Arcana on the other hand (empress) is such a spam of keys in boundless mana while also having to keep track of stacks AND use cards is by far the hardest class I've played. It's just absolutely exhausting to play her, it's the only character I actually feel tired after a raid and even if I get MVP I still feel like I did many mistakes lol
Three of those issues can be somewhat solved but agree with the rest.  Mana: Always taking mana food with me but yeah it sucks.  will moonflash kick be back up: had to experiment in trixion so that all cooldowns align. for my 2 spender WD it was: 1500+ swiftness, lv5 quick prep & lv9 CD gem on Whisper, lv 1 quick prep & lv 7 CD gem on Courage, Lv8 CD gem (saving gold for 9 or 10) on MFK (moonflash kick). Rest is lv 7. If your cooldowns don't align in trixion it's way harder to pull it off in a real raid. Now everything is 10 seconds BUT for MFK...it's just such a long CD  missing small targets: using MFK just before blast helps a bit. not sure what build you play but a common 2 spender rotation is whisper>roar>wind god>mfk>blast>flash heat fang>ssb (counter) for extending damage buff on blast ticks.
This is why 4 spender wasnt in the community guide for the longest time. They considered it a meme trixion build that most players cant pull off in real raid scenarios. You have to be glued to the boss 24/7 for EC to give you meter and aggressively ssb for meter as well or u cant combo.
Try swapping ready attack tripod on spiral impact to lucky bubble and then tap RFD -> SI rather than SI -> hold RFD. It's a bit less Trixion, plays more like 3spender hallu, and gets rid of most gauge issues.
I'll look into it, maybe that may be the call for me too. Probably gonna do some Trixion shenanigans.       Cheers for the tip.
Yeah I won't do any raids that aren't already on farm mode with her, especially since she's outside of my main 6 roster.     So it's just gonna be Vykas, Clown and Brel 1-2 HM / 3-4 NM I think. And RS seems great on clown in particular.
And here I am about to drop my Tai for Slayer if we get her this summer. I just slowly fell out of love for the class with how much you have to invest in it as an alt. Also the abilities just don't bring the hype like my ShadowHunter which I will most likely be dropping for SoulEater.
Only hit master class which is as fun as entropy classes in vykas G2...
or just press z to call your drone back  you can use that to animation cancel a lot of your drone abilities so you can cast the next one easier
there isn't. it only sucks when you fat finger and go into persona mode and lose all of your bars, having to start over. wish the engraving disabled it.
I hope that with a bit more spec and practice I'll be able to make it works, the alt need 2 more hones for bracelet, if that still doesn't  work I'll go back to 3 spender halu and drop some spec for swift
(play the triple quick recharge build) Great damage, easier rotation, cheaper to gem  Oh, and RS uses completely identical tripods to EO
Tai and slayer are massively different playstyles, slayer is like a back attack igniter lol.   You simply don't like tai at all and thats it, it's also an extremely cheap alt no clue why you think it requires lots of investment.   Regards, a 1550 scrapper alt
I LOOOOOOVE VYKAS G2  I LOOOOVE WHEN I DROP HOMING AND AIR RAID AND SHE JUST   ***ZOOOOOOMS OUT OF THE WAY***  I HOP INTO BARRAGE, GUESS WHAT ??? SHE'S ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MAP NOW AHAHHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHHAHHAHAHA  &#x200B;  Send help i do 3 barrage arti vykas runs a week
Same for sorc, Doomsday isn't that much different other than the also 2 seconds cast time lol
Igniter, Master Summoner, and Emperor are the same way. GS used to be the same way as well before they buffed the slower skills. Super slow skills that have to be pre-targeted are a pretty common part of many hit master kits.
Im aware. Tho rather then canceling i just use one of my normal skills at the same time as my drone skills(my skills are 4/2/2) so i dont often make too much use of the cancel.
This. I was looking for this. Please disable persona mode. But they won't because chaos stacks on top of persona for some reason...
I have two friends who play it and it really seems gate dependent. Some gates you just arent gonna be able to be glued to the boss and itll cripple the build so having some swift items to swap to 3 spender hallu for those gates would be ideal.
I have 1540 tai scrapper that will stay there. It's not that I don't like the class, but that I don't want to invest in it to be able to keep up dmg with other classes. Now if it only needed like 1/2 lvl 10 gems then I would be fine with it since it's an alt. Scrapper needs way more than that and should be treated as main class in long run to pump dmg. Sorry, I'm not a whale that can afford to get all lvl9-10 gems yet for a alt.
Not *that* cheap.  Books are still pretty expensive...
How do you even get your meter filled for barrage with her flying all over the place?
Poor you.. 3x is really frustrating
If you think anything needs level 10 gems to be competitive with an overwhelming majority of the player base you are likely just not good at the class.   I've seen plenty of Tai scrappers at comparable ilvl in Brel MVP or cruel fighter with full 7 gems. (Run 6 Brels a week)   Literally nobody in this game even expects mains to have full 9-10 gems unless they RMT and only play with people that do as well.
Funny fomo u got going there.   Slayer will require the same amount of gems btw.   It's absurd to compare alts to mains in terms of gem investments, all classes other than the 2 transformer classes can make use of 11 level 10 gems.   The amount of randoms in my PLC runs or even in bus runs that are full lv9 gems is slim, full level 10 is a very rare sighting.   Do you *need* to compensate lack of uptime with gems or what? Theres no breakpoints for Tai where it would require higher investment gems.
The whole reason I just rebuilt my scrapper was because books came down and are super cheap.  They're like 2k right now on NAW. A few months ago they were more like 9-12k.  I got a full 5x3 set of purple quality accessories for mine for like 55k.    That's about as cheap as it gets for an alt with a proper build.  Even the runes are easy to come by.  No wealth runes or Conviction/Judgement needed.
It really is amongst the cheapest meta builds by far.  Can take crit / swift however u want (what's cheaper) and books have gotten super cheap lately.
Knowing mechanics... But yeah it sucks
There is no way you are able to compete with only lvl 7 gems with people that are good at the game. We have pugs come in and never make the boards with us on it.     Lvl 7 gems is competitive when pugging with people who are avg players for sure, but not wtih people who play their class well.We hardly see any scrappers on board. Hell we just had a 1560 scrapper in Vkyas that didn't get cruel fighter while we did. Fyi we were Arcane, Destoyer, and Shock Scrapper.     I think you just play with bad/avg players a majority of the times while my static members are straight up above avg so gl outdpsing them as a swift back attacker.
I'm talking about pumping dmg. Slayer will out pump a Tai scrapper. I have hardly seen any Tai scrappers on board at the end of my raids on my alt runs. You can have good uptime and still get out dpsed by a Zerker. Scrapper just doesn't pump dmg without gems which require high investment. If you're out dpsing a Sorc, DB, arcane+ then you're playing with some bad players or a whale.
Guess I haven't checked book prices that recently.  Last I checked they were still quite high, one of the more expensive books in fact.
Eh nope, the fact is if you are good at an uptime class with tons of mobility, especially in dynamic fights where the boss moves a lot e.g. Brel G3/5/6 it's really not that hard to perform well.   Tai is also high middle of the most recent trixion parses from KR that have been discussed heavily on this subreddit, so maybe you should evaluate who you are playing with/bringing in... if you regularly play Tai with similarly geared people and aren't doing well you are probably just bad.  Believe it or not most people that are crazy over leveled running Vykas aren't going to try hard, especially if the group is similarly geared.   I'm sure I could easily come in and thump with your crew on my AS machinist.
> If you're out dpsing a Sorc, DB, arcane+  I dont need to outdps the top 5 dps to be pulling my weight or to stroke my ego.   I'm often enough on the scoreboard on my alt and even top DPS just because a well played tai will outpferom an average meta, let alone a bad meta chaser (which the majority are).   I find it hard to believe that you hardly see scrappers on the leaderboard, they're extremely easy to perform well with, to the point where an average scrapper is easily on the same dps output as an avg DB.
Tai books are 4k on NAE lmao
Did you just bring up trixion dmg, where you get to hit the back all the time with no downtime. HAHAHA, ok I'm over this
Yes, just like igniters never miss.   If you don't understand there is value in theoretical maximums I suppose you really shouldn't be arguing.   You can have an objective measure e.g. what the class can actually do, or your subjective, you play with shitters 100% of the time apparently...

It still bothers me to this day that we can't use toy items on places where we must spend most time doing nothing - looking at you, adventure islands.
Thank you! Updating post
Just drop it. 9/7 stone lets you:  - Get a cheap 5x3 with relic  - Get a cheap 5x3+1 with ancient  - Spend a bit of gold getting a ~3% damage increase with 5x3+1 using relic  - Spend an insane amount of gold getting a ~5% damage increase with 5x3+2 using ancient  The biggest thing you're "wasting" is the chance to dump a truckload of gold into it for a small gain that's only really worthwhile after everything else is upgraded beyond what most people invest even in the alts they like.
You ultimately the game for fun, right? So do what's most fun for you.   Also keep in mind that the to get any damage boost from a 9/7 stone you need a lot of investment. And even then the benefit isn't huge.  I have a 9/7 stone on a lopang employee and I have no regrets. Other classes are just slightly more enjoyable.
Drop another character, or play all of them, gold or no gold, who cares, you have the liberty, you do what you find fun.
What’s the engravings on your 9/7 and which character is it? Just out of curiosity.
You can rotate your characters every week. Sure it won’t pay itself off ever but you get more characters to play and that’s fun in the long run
Bruh I randomly got a 10/6 back in vykas release and dropped the game soon after, idgaf. Also it was a pally
Excellent odds slayer will be completely terrible/underwhelming by the time it comes to our version, examples: glaivier/reaper.  Aeromancer already got her round of nerds so she seems in place.
Most players will NEVER ever get a 9/7. Sorry but if you don't recognize its value, might as well not play the game.
just buy a chatacter slot ... i understand why some ppl won't spend money for various reasons but if u can afford it then do it ... its not like ur buying rng cards or loot boxes...   anyways, in case u didnt know, ... support can restore u any deleted character once or twice a year ... u can see and confirm that on the fourms ... now, what am trying to say is, u can potentially delete the so called boring character and try out aero/slayer and if ur happy with that, then good but if ur not happy, then delete aeeo/slayer and get ur old chatacter back..  hope it helps
One time someone told me they accidentally learned a deathblow book. I ask them if they actually want to spend 500k+ on making a deathblow build, or just eat the lost. They just ate the lost. If you don’t enjoy the class, no need to really spend a fuck ton of gold just so you can get, idk like 1-2% stronger.
Drop it. Char enjoyment and investment goes hand in hand. If you love it spend tons of gold if not don't spend anything.     I dropped my 1520 striker who has the highest weapon quality in my roster -99.     Wish it was on another char but that ain't gonna save him
I mean, it’s not like you’re gonna delete the char, right? Just take a break from that new lopang alt, maybe you’ll start playing it again. Who knows, maybe you’re not gonna wanna main 6 the aero or slayer?
If You wanna drop a character, just do it. You dont need our advice.
Came here to write this, but it's already said lol.  9/7 is only useful if you're going to invest gold heavily in the first place. Otherwise, it's nothing special and I wouldn't worry about it.
You’re totally right man, silvers caught me a slack from cutting stone(z) now I feel like I fell behind just by chasing this stupid 9/7 stone..
Its my deadeye and I haven't gotten him a 5x3 yet. I believe hes only at 1460 too so hes not too high i lvl.
Igniter GS Arcana Summoner seems to have come over just fine
I have the character slots needed to keep him I just don't know if I want to keep pushing him or drop him from my 6 gold earners for those other classes. That is so true though. I can always just pick up that class again at a later point if I want to.
It's basically what you do after you have fully decked out the character. A single level 10dmg gem will be better than this, let alone a couple
This may sounds offensive to you but you should be thankful. I’m deadeye EW main  and still been chasing 9/7 stone because I really do love it’s play style which it’s very unique from other classes. Also Besides Deadeye has a very average but expensive to roid it up. But it’s protected from getting nerf from Votes from Korean Community. Think about your manual poopbox car but has a very rare engine.
Deadeye 9/7 is pretty meh if we had to compare to other classes. Don't let it play something you don't like, it'll be much worse if you hone it further just to drop it then. If you don't like a class, drop it asap.
Don't force yourself to play him, but maybe there's an alternative play style that you haven't tried that can make it feel more fun to play? I've swapped builds on a few of my characters as I got bored and generally came to enjoy them over time. What is it you don't like about deadeye?
Damn, man. I just boosted a Deadeye finally after maining two gunslingers because I thought it'd be fun to have the male version too. I'm not saying you had an impact on how I will feel about the class now, but I cant say I'm not arsed by why you would be sacrificing deadeye for something else. Gunslinger is a very, very fun class and is the only class I'd have two of. I'm crossing my fingers and my toes that Deadeye will be just as good and complex.
Yeah I noticed it is so much more expensive that my other classes for getting a 5x3. I guess because it isn't very popular. I do really enjoy playing the class but I just feel I would enjoy those other classes more
I don't 100% know. Maybe I'm just not happy cause im not juicing on him like my main, which is 1540 so a big difference in ilvl. I also don't really want to spend a lot of money getting him a 5x3 because his accessories are super expensive even now.
You can keep it as a lopang :) then later when aeromancer/slayer comes out if you didn’t like them you could give deadeye a try again. I have some 1500s I gave up on but they’re still great for silver
Try out pistoleer. Books are dirt cheap. So are the accessories. Used to hate him, because of how clanky EW feels like, now he’s my main 1553.
Makes sense then, don't need to push if you don't want but if you don't mind you could always just maintain him doing leapstone dailies and rested chaos for silver and shards so eventually you can build him when relics get cheaper, they will eventually.
Doesn’t the system tab literally say where it’s saving your screenshots?
Couldn't they have all just switched characters?
All selfies can be found at:  X:\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Lost Ark\\EFGame\\Screenshots  X is the drive where you Steam is installed
sadly the mass bans are with the major patches every few months.
That’s not weird.  Been around since day one
sadly I’m pretty sure that’s just a multi boxer using multiple botted characters and switching off the characters at the same time.   also your screenshots should be in local files, steam apps and common? there should be a screenshots folder

I'd say if you want to push your alts push them to 1490. Then they can start doing Brel G1-G2 and passively gain free ilvls as you farm out the new gear set and will also make it easier to find parties for Vykas and Kakul if you pug plus they can also farm the new mats from the 1490 CD and guardian which is beneficial for your main.
So would you say to keep pushing the 1475 to brel and then move one to the next?
Yes, I think that will be much better than let's say two 1475s. You can also get some honing books weekly from the Brel vendor to make honing a bit cheaper.
Yeah and also the books from the raid i forgot about that. Thanks for the help!
good luck
Might get downvoted, but I appreciate them for not afk'ing compared to REAL players who do afk tho
>I appreciate them for not afk'ing compared to REAL players who do afk tho  Your assumption is not up to date and wrong.  The previous patch note of Artist release specifically said a play can't go afk in a chaos gate session any more. So there won't be any afk real players anyways, and no way bots are more helpful, as they just keep dying and reviving while doing trivial damage but still get a share of golden map auction  https://preview.redd.it/hikbqsfogfsa1.png?width=855&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4f1b8fea25b6490b0a713ce3f519adb4b4f01dee  [https://www.playlostark.com/en-us/news/articles/the-art-of-war-release-notes](https://www.playlostark.com/en-us/news/articles/the-art-of-war-release-notes)
Yes, I know they recently updated about Chaos Gate. I should have mentioned, but I was implying before they updated the patch but thanks for that
My screenshot was from the recent session right? Why would I use an old screenshot before the patch which was already online on 14 March 2023.. There is no point discussing what happened in the past because it is not valid any more?
Tbh, I cannot tell if that was before or after Chaos Gate QoL patch solely based on that screenshot. And sorry for discussing the past
Thanks. You completely misled the discussion to another useless direction where you concern is long gone
Get that Stick out of your behind man
Lostarkmarket has a crafting calculator   Although I really disliked it bc it didn't consider taxes and such so I ended up making my own sheet. Would recommend doing so since you can suit it to your own needs

Nae because im here
go NA.  If you dont feel delay with 200ms, then i assume you havent tried doing raids.  i mean,there are tons of people playing fine with 150+ms,but i would prefer low ms.  it also depends on which class are you playing,it is uncomfortable to play with a high ping to classes with a lot of mobility and fast combos.  about population,both NAE/NAW (probably East is more active) and EUC are all healthy regions.
NA East then since you're clearly located in North America given the ping. It's a healthy region with the 3 most populous servers being Azena, Una and Regulus.
NAE - Una
Go NA ping takes a toll on pvp.
the net code is done in a way such that the client doesnt rly have to wait for the server to input commands, but you will rubber band with high ping
NAE Una
I honestly think that Lost Ark should have a "place order" type of thing on the AH. It took me 4 months to find a necklace with the correct class engraving for my alt because most people just auto-salvage as soon as they see certain engraving combos.
I'm not on your server, but I just want to tell you that I support your controversial approach to a build. I have a friend who runs his Soulfist with Expertise and Swiftness with Vital Point Hit and Yearning. The build sucks, but it's funny to watch him melt the bars. I saw him solo the stagger in Valtan gate 1, he *is* the Wei cheese.
Gl, the sc/gru one possible but the RH specific ones are too narrow, class acc already rare enough as it is unless it’s 3/3 legendary.  Speaking of which why don’t u use rh books and then easier to get non class accs
are you trying to stagger clown bingo or something lol
I only do horizontal content now, but I respect the commitment wish you luck ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thumbs_up)
If there wasn't a listing limit so low and the relist button actually worked, we'd probably see more off meta accessories.
Why do you need a class engraving on stagger bot?  Edit: nvm. Why are trying to do dmg on stagger bot?
You know what, I respect it. Good luck on your mission my man.
Sadly my destoyer is not even 1415 yet but I will uncheck expertise on him
Bus drivers usually use those accessories to bus brel since it requires a stagger bot.
not using the auto salvage.....will keep an eye out for these. :D
I'll be listing for 100k minimum  if you want 'em you'll buy 'em
If only I saw this post earlier.
Ooh you're making a stagger bot build like [this?](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/787292540692856842/1093720322550804530/image.png)  It's the most satisfying solo stagger everything build.
What about 90+ expertise bracelets?  How much are they listings for those?
Oh are you that stagger bot scrapper I ran into the other day in Brel who staggered everything for us in a second in g4? You asked for the same thing lol.
Make sure to run the Running Crash skill with the tripod that makes enemies take 20% more stagger damage for 6 seconds. My favorite combo is Running Crash + Earth Eater to the face.
Just put up a 100 expertise 1 roll bracelet on AH lol if u need
The people’s WW grenade is so gold
Well, you digged your own grave by locking your alt into this position of needing class engr on your neck.  Getting a neck is the first priority after cutting a stone when you are building a character. The only possibility of getting class neck would be is if you were lucky and found a neck initially when you were looking for possible builds. But otherways don't do it as neck 1/6th chance to be bis because of +1 variety factor.
I run this build for Gates 2 and 4 in Brel currently so everyone else can bring Dark bombs. We've seen a 25% faster clear with dark bomb rotations.      Running VPH + Overwhelm on a Des with 451 Expertise (12.90% Stagger Damage). I want to further increase this by 1 shotting the stagger checks.
Yeah Expertise builds are kinda troll but also fucking amazing for cheesing any stagger-related mechanics  I have been too busy with classes to finish my expertise FPE arti build
It's an option - I have the books.      I just want more people to put Expertise on the market so my fellow Destroyers can partake in the joy of everyone freaking out over a deleted stagger bar.
Yeah, a build like this demands class books. A normal destroyer class piece on NAE can already be hard to find. Now take a lower pop server and try to find a piece that 90% of people have auto dismantle set up to grind instantly, and of the 10% remaming most won't give a second thought to an expertise class drop. Then multiply that by 3
Possibly
The thing is we hadn't had the limit for that long, and we didn't have many beforehand due to no one seeing much value in these stats. It definitely is a niche thing and a meme to some.      All it takes is a little motivation and the will to put a bounty on these items.
Always try to contribute as much as I can
Correct, but I don't bus. I just wanna hear the homies lose their minds
No. It's a want, not a need. Goodluck on the sale, though.
I got one of those already - fairly cheap, it was something like 1.5k at the time i bought it.
I'm not haha, but I hope that the post helps bring more expertise accessories to the market.
I actually got two accessory drops with engravings and stats combo that would work for my build and saved almost 100k in accessories, so not really my fault there.
Yea, what gives, do people still don't know how to build their character properly, it's an alt too so he is supposed to know how to do it. You don't really need a degree in engineering, you start with whatever book you have that you can equip, then stone then class engraving accessory, then you can either go on the neck or find everything else first and fishing with the neck (if you have a 77 stone and two +12 books your neck will be an easy 5 plus random stat and that's super cheep and easy to cheeze free stats points). You can go with a  +3 class engraving and +3 some other stat if you want to find a cheaper class accessory (but then the neck piece will cost you a lot more since you will be looking for good quality piece)
Man, that sounds awesome, honestly. You go hit those checks like they're made of butter, best of luck finding your stuff!
Good shit! I love it when people do builds outside the usual meta.
wahts the purpose of staggering in g2? aside from to enter prokel
Can you list your full 5x3 for those 2 gates? and outside those 2 gates, i'm insterested to build this myself on EUC sounds like a cool thing to build :)
I’m on NA West and I can say I would accept you in my party any day. It’s a legit build.
sure ill do my part, ill put some up if i have extra AH listings (pretty rare these days)  but i have no destroyers. destroyer will be a fraction of ppl who read this
There were a LOT more off-meta or subpar accs on the market previously.   It's also been a hot minute with the limitation, easily 3-4 months by now.
What I would have done would probably sell them and use that 100k to get the books and your full build.
More time to Prokel Stun, solo the stagger add.      There isn't a whole lot else to do in this gate other than kill adds so killing 2 birds with 1 stone is my thinking here. If our guildmates bring lower dmg alts, I just run the normal build but use the Stagger Debuff charge to help speed things up a bit.
I'm currently running Rage Hammer > Grudge > Super Charge > Keen Blunt > Vital Point Hit with a 100 Expertise / 60 Crit Bracelet for Gates 2 and 4. I have 451 Expertise which gives 12.9% stagger damage.      Outside of that, Just swap VPH for Master Brawler and a 100 Spec / 55 Crit Bracelet. I want to drop KBW for Barricade but I it'd be difficult. (Stone is a 9/6 stone).
Books alone were more than 100k for Legendary and would not work for any of my other characters.
I just saw a Destro melting Vykas stagger on G3 during the last mech on a bus earlier today, it’s so cool that we can see build like that now. I’ll definitely try it when mine is fully build :)

So the 450 expertise is from 1 necklace? or how do i see how you got to 451, idk if the 100 expertise from the bracelet is included in the 451, because that means like a earring + ring or something with expertise?
I think the idea is more to future proof your character. It is hard to determine if you'll stick to the character enough to make it worth it, but if you do find that special character it makes a world of a diff.
Sorry, I wasn't sure if that is what you meant. At the time I had only an Earring and Bracelet with Expertise on them for the 451 Expertise.      Now, we have a Necklace, Earring, Ring, and Bracelet + Pet for expertise.    I'll leave this here.   https://preview.redd.it/06ewwmh1ajsa1.png?width=692&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4cac9e782b5556472d2f248877bbaeff8d7ab7c7
It looks like you were stealthed while being targeted. For some reason the game just switches the target at the last moment when clown targets a stealthed player. Usually this only happens with Reaper since I believe SS doesn't run stealth in meta raid builds.
Quick switchero
New mech. Typical clown things
you dash too quick the taget moved to the glaive
This can also happen when Reapers turn invisible, and he can then also target the clone.
Yoo that actually makes sense. Im stealthed because of the awakening i casted before. Still a really weird interaction tho.
Never ran into that. But generally after you use that ult your hitting/casting at same time so you not sure how you managed that!
I had (at that time) a 1520 Summoner with 98 quality weapon and a 1415 summoner alt I would use for guardian dispatch for books. Well I decided to do a simple build on the 1415 summoner and in 2 stones gets a 9/7. So now I have a 1545 Summoner and 1520 Summoner 😅
I cut a 9/7/1 on my destroyer alt.  Was trying for a 7/7.  I think it took me 10-15, somewhere in there.  Just got absurdly lucky.  Not much else to say.
I cut well over 2000 in KR before I got one and I cut it backwards 9 Adren/7 kbw, I was livid.  In NAW, I've cut about 500, and I've plenty of 8/7s but yet to hit
i have 15 characters with at least a 7 7 stone  3 of those have an 8 7, and 3 have 9 6’s  my main had a 45% chance of cutting a literally perfect 9 7 1 stone but I failed ofc and so its an 8 7 1 (hm adren)  i also still cut every stone that could be a useful 9 7 i see now, on every char  with that being said, i have no idea how many rocks ive cut but its a LOT lol. it just seems to be heavily skill based and unfortunately im complete trash  ive got a buddy thats had 2 cut since whenever vykas was the highest raid out, and hes totally f2p. he did me so dirty and literally cut one while he watched me go 45 stones without a 7 7
Every time I think about cutting a stone … I buy a gem instead. 🤷🏻‍♂️
All the 97s iv seen from friends have been unintentional chaos dungeon stone drops.
I bought 30, said f it. Next day I find one in chaos, 9/8
3 lol. Was trying to get 7/7 on my main a few months ago and kinda lucked into 9/7 AoA/ADR (barrage arti) stone, wasn't really paying attention until the whole thing was over. Just super lucky.
Only 1 because it was a Challenge raid drop from over half year ago. 7/9/1 Cursed Doll Precise Dagger. Dagger is not bad with Entropy and Cursed Doll is the 2nd best +2, I am happy with this stone
5 stones.  Not joking, i got it 1st week once relic stuff was a thing. Problem is it's 2 engravings that i want lvl 3.

About 23 stones for my main and 3 for my alt. Was going for 7/7 on main and 7/6 on alt. My friend cut a 9/8 on the first or second stone he bought for his artist.  I think most people with a 9/7 are going to be in the "I cut a couple dozen trying for a decent rock and got really really lucky" camp because the people willing to brute-force it are such an absurdly small minority.
Over 1000 never seen one yet. handful of 10/5-6,  9/6s, 8/7s.
3rd stone. New striker alt that I wanted to eventually main swap to.  Was still relatively new to the game, didn’t know about 9/7 stones really or the implications of certain engravings.   3 stones. 9/7/1 Ambush/KBW/defense  I’ve been 5x3x1 for months. Few points to make before anyone goes out spending their life saving on a 9/7 A- it isn’t the huge dmg increase people make it out to be. In fact, if I don’t have a high uptime crit buff, I potentially do less damage than a striker with 5x3 and adrenaline 3.  B- I’m never running kbw 2. Even if it’s a dps increase at 5x3x2 just feel sick to even consider it.  C- for the performance I get- the gold cost to dps ratio isn’t even close to worth it. I had to buy class and dps leg books, a 5/3 class piece on the most expensive class in the game.   I’m not crying here. It’s been an advantage at times. When I’m in the right group I absolutely slap. But I’ve also been beaten on damage by people who are 5x3 plenty of times and it’s not a skill issue or am I played bad/didn’t crit rng. The difference is pretty minimal even in trixion.   Now if I was able to go adrenaline 2 at ancient, I think that would be a game changer, but like…. You need to dodge so many bullets to get that stone. I saw someone else post here that they got a 9/7 with adrenaline at 9. I’d literally break my computer. Because for all the luck I had on my strikers 9/7 I paid back tenfold getting 7/7 on all of my Alts.  Stone cutting is absolutely cancer.
I cut a 9 1 and an 9-4 today The universe hates me
Cut one on my first ever relic stone when I hit 1415, never been able to cut one again and struggle to cut 7/7s..
My first was an accident when trying to get 7/7 on my summoner, was the \~12th stone.  The second i brute forced on my main as around 50-70 stones, didnt keep track that closely, that one is the wrong way around tho, hitmaster 7 adrenaline 9 sadge.  This is pretty insane luck tho, i think on average its a chance of something like one in 1500 (stone cutting calculators show a chance of 0.07% when selecting 9/7 stone) but you could get it the wrong way around like i did, so a perfect one is propably worse.
I’ve rolled maybe 20 stones in total on my 3 main characters and have 9/6, 9/7, and 8/7. Ez clap
Got mine at around 500+ stones, which is in the 50th percentile in terms of luck. You can check the average stone luck [here](https://iloa.gg/tools/stone)
not a 9-7 but 5 stones for 9-9
3 :-)
I spent like 55k or 60k blue crystal to get a 9/7. Had like 11 9/6 ,10/5 and couldn't believe my luck how I couldn't get 1 9/7 and it finally happened.
Ended up with a 9/8 on my destro i dont even play. Cut like 10 to 15 rocks trynna get a 6/6
Well, it's hard to tell. I know when I got mine I was at my wits end, I had been getting rocks and cutting on different toons throughout well over a month, investing ~900 pheons into the character that got it. She hadn't cut anything above 6/5 and I almost uninstalled before I got lucky. How many rocks did I cut before? I honestly don't know, I know I gave up on trying on 3 characters and settled for 7/6s before. Since then I've cut thousands of rocks, got some 9/6s, but no more 9/7s. Soon though, surely. Copium.
3rd stone, was not even looking for it.
I took about 700+ stones to cut my stone and I think I got fairly lucky, which just goes to show how low the chances actually are lol.   Worst part is that it's unusable for me in my current relic build, I'd need to completely rebuild relic or wait for full ancient to use the stone :/
When I got my tai scrapper to 1415 I was aiming for a 7/7. 2nd stone I got a 9/7/2 grudge cursed doll stone. I already had adrenaline legendary at the time so didnt cut for that.  Probably about the same joy as when my main SH went from 60 - > 100 wep quality after like 50 failed attempts lol.  But yeah I would never purposely go for a 9/7, the 9/7 comes to you.
Got it on my summoner trying for a 7/7. Took about \~15 stones and got the 9/7. But I also have 6 other alts, all with 7/7. A couple of my alts aslo have other 7/7s and 9/6s from old builds.
My Main has a reverse 9/7 AD - KBW. I want to switch KBW for Raid Captain in a future. To get the stone, I could say less than 10. Though I cut tons of RC / AD without luck. More than 200 pheons.  An alt has another reverse 9/7 AD - RC. I switch Glaivier Pinnacle for Ctrl and after having a 7/7, I got a 9/7. Less tries than Main for sure. At least, this stone will become a 5x3+2 build. With RC as lvl 2.  The rest of alts 7/7.
I stopped counting after 50+ couldn't get a single 7/7, then the pattern recognition kicked in and i got my 9/7. But i wouldn't suggest chasing stones, it's the best way to quit the game imho
You don't cut your 9/7s, your 9/7s choose you.  Been trying hundreds of rocks on my main, if not a thousand by now, and still haven't gotten one. Cut a 9/7 pvp rock on first try.  Same for my wd alt. Was just trying to craft a 7/7 for her, and like 8th rock in it was 9/7.  Likewise for my new zerk. 3rd rock I cut a 9/7.  When you're not aiming for it you get it when you least expect it. At least from my experience.
About 5 stones to cut a 9 adrenaline/7 hit master stone on my alt summoner. The rng in this game can be so random.
However many stones 3m gold got me(pheon cost included)
[removed]
4 on my reaper on release. Not even using it cause i switched specs and its 9 grudge 7 Kern blunt which is just useless
I cut a 9/8/0 on my gunslinger, one of the first rocks. It was just a throwaway to upgrade from legendary. gogo keen blunt strong will!
3 stones on my main (a support, with 7 being Heavy Armor). Never been able to cut a 7-7 on all my alts following this (I make do with 7-6 8-6 8-5 6-6), but finally broke the curse on artist after \~12 stones :)
i got super lucky; i made a sorc and the 1st stone i cut was 9 7.  this was my first alt, and i probably bought and cut less than 10 stones across all characters before this.
3 stones. Problem is that nobody is selling the engravings i need for a 5x3+1. At least i have a cheap 5x3 though
9/8 on the sixth rock I cut for my deadeye, who became my main then and there
My 1st stone on arcana when she came out. She is now my main until I burn out from sweaty gameplay.
My Bard cut a 9/7 after 20-25ish stones. I was just aiming for a 7/7…
I cut a 9/6 on my first stone for artist (expert/vital point) and 4th stone is 8/8/0 (expert/awakening) I am not cutting any more stones until I can afford pheons
never went for 9/7,but few days ago I started preparing my scrapper (new main) for 5x3 bought 9 stones and all went 7/6, next day I gave it last chance and got 7/7/3
2 lopang slave 1415 got 9 7 by cuting drop rock and i have to spend alot gold pushed them to 1540 recently :v
Cut a 10-6 on deadeye, 7 tries ezpz
I cut a 10/7/1 on my artist on the second day. It was a stone from the stone chests i saved from challenge content. Out of +400 boxes i got 3 useable stones and the first one I cut was the one.  [here is the cut](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1773326294?filter=highlights&sort=time)
Once and was from chaos dungeon. I have 1070 stone. 10 adre 7hm
3, i lucked out on so much. First i had a 7/7 on my second stone so was done, was looking relic for gear on AH with my mate and was so expensive. So i said 'maybe i should try get a 8/7 stone so i can cheap out on an item', he told me its hard and that i got luck gettng 7/7 on second cut, but try you'll see ... and the next cut was 9ambush/7adre.    He told me 'well it aint ideal, you want +1 in adrenaline' but i went adre on stone cause cheaper and didnt want Cursed doll, a week later i learned 7 adre is perfect for 5x3+2 build.   So i fluked out on so much without knowing, but it made gearing more expensive instead of cheaper cause needing both books legendary :x
On my bard i spent 500 pheons on stones (so about 55?) At 200 i got a reverse 9/7 with 9 malice.  At 500 i got an actual 9/7  Not a single 7/7 inbetween
9/9 pre-emptive/contender. F-m-l
I currently have 3 9/7 stones.. honestly if I’m cutting stones I just go for 9/7s I gamble a lot on taps. But I don’t really cut that many to begin with. I think I’ve probably cut close 150 stones all together. 9/7 on SH, 9/7 on Bard, and 9/7 on GL.
I was lucky with 7/7 stones on my main and few alts. Have some 8/7's on 2 my main and 2 of my alts without any effort. Then arcana came and I had to keep on cutting and nothing popped. I was in around 30 stones when I made a 10/6 grudge/raid captain stone. Not the perfect thing for +1/2 later on but will save me alot of money.
Was cutting one for my wd alt. I was doing it just for the lols and got a 9-7-2. Adre 9, awakening 7![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|dizzy_face) it was my first stone.
My 97 is on my BT alt, cut it by chance while trying to not even 7/7 but get a 7/5 without the movespeed negative LOL.
Tried to cut a 7/7 stone for a pistoleer alt, (my weakest char on the roaster), cut around 15-30 adrenaline stone with 0 luck, was running low on gold and pheons so decided to start cutting extremely cheap stone that work with pistoleer.   Now I have a 9/9 stone (cursed doll, precise dagger) on a pistoleer.
I cut a bunch of stones early getting one 7 7. So I stopped on all my chars and waited for my main to come out. Then from the start I went agresivly for 9 7 and I got it in let's say 30 tries. I got 10 6 on my alt as well in some 20 tries wasn't going for it. But then on a class I need it on to make build work I have failed over 100 with multiple 8 7 with 65% to succeed and few lower
l have 2 9-7 both reversed and one of them is quite troll (mass inc/kbw 9-7 on zerk MAYHEM) first one took 3 attempts (was going for 7-5); second one was 11 attempts (was going for 7-7)
Oneshot for the first one when relic stones came out and the one on my alt was like 40 in trying to get a 7/7
Only one 9/7/2 on the artillerist (CD adren) after cutting around 30 stones.  Then hit a 9/6/0 on the GL in one try
900 pheons invested. Still no 9/7
I didn't have a relic on my bard so I thought i'd get one and so I bought a stone..it failed..bought another one and got a 9/7/2...still have it in my inventory. But the next one in line to build is my bard. So in total 2 Stones to get a 9/7.
Like 4? I cutted 9/7 on my reaper alt. Just needed 7/7 for 5x3, and then i did that shit ;_;  On my main i need 9/7 for 5x3 +1 class and i cutted 3k pheons of stones and jest shot was 9/6 and 8/7 i have now
Huh everytime i get 9/7 i thought it was normal
i have a deathblade with 9 ambush and 7 adre and a reaper with 9 grudge 7ambush i think i got lucky and i have a 8/8 on my sorc allout/hitmaster
9/7/0 on my FIRST attempt on a Blue Lancer stone. Didn’t even know what I had, Bless RNGesus.
4 stones back in valtan days ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|smile)
On my reaper I cut 3 stones. Got a 9-7.  On my gunslinger I cutted 600 stones. No 9-7.
I cut it once on a 1st try on my Bard. It was a 9/7 Preemptive/Contender that I picked up. Never have I ever hated myself...
Found out about stone calculators, figured what the hell. 3rd stone I hit a reverse kbw/adren for my GS. She'll be sitting pretty on 5x3+1 for quite a while.
On my sorc i needed like 100, but on my summoner i got it from the first try ,😁
I hv one 9-7 in my 2nd alt (I’ve only 5 but treated them equally).   She got it the stone from KFC, grudge + kbw, I thought to sell but considering the pheon cost, I gave it a try without selling once I thought to make her 5x3. So, free stone, first try for 9-7.   Main hero also got 8-7 with first stone from market too. Then pitied her brel weapon from 17 to 20. Haha.
I think most people who gets it is on accident while trying to get 7/7
I have a 9/8/1 on my Demonic Impulse, it took around 13 stones going for it.
If you remember how many you got way to lucky.
15 and got 10/7
I got. 9/8/0 while trying to get a 7/7. I have probably cut over 500 rocks on my account so far. Mabye closer to 1000 really. Got 11 9/6 or 8/7 rocks too.
0
Please don’t downvote me to oblivion. I got very lucky and cut a 9/7 with 16 stones.  I have yet to be able to cut a 7/7 for my paladin alt and have cut over 60 stones for it.
Hey!   I own 2  9/7 stones, 1 for my paladin it took me 2 took, and 1 for my reaper took me 5 cut.
Lucky but unlucky 9/7 stone owner because it’s Raid Captain/Cursed Doll.   Korea had gotten a balance patch and for Glaviers they got dmg increase on their red skills so people were taking off mass increase and swapping to raid captain. To get ahead of the game I decided to make the swap in NA even though the changes weren’t live. I was primarily cutting RaidCap/Cursed Doll stones and was aiming for a 7/7 in my reparation of the balance patch. 4 stones in, I got a 9/7.   Morale of the story is you don’t choose 9/7 stones, they choose you.
I’m not sure which is which lol. Did you stop honing the 98 quality one?
Do guardian dispatches have higher chance at books?
Ye this is the way, same way i got it on my wd. Was trying to cut a 7/7 and got it lol.
This is closer to how it's supposed to be and how it usually is, we just don't hear about it. Most of the people who have 9/7's got lucky to extremely lucky.
My max on buying pheons from US Dollars is $900 plus but still no 9/7 stone but I get 8/7 stones, did I regret it? Yes , will do it again? No  EDIT: I'm stubborn after all swiped for $100 more for pheons and look at this bs. https://ibb.co/54jbKhT , It really is not meant to be.
That is how I got mine, random stone from CD that I could use
On the flip side, you probably saved a huge amount of gold thanks to that stone.
i still dont get why ppl say those stones are sh\*it, at the end of the day, if you re +2 is on your access, it s still a +2
A 10/6 works. I’m a couple hundred deep and settled on an 8/8 which unfortunately does not work
10/6 is a god stone. Very similar to 9/7
I love your concluding line
Striker lvl 1 adren is super bad. But lvl 2 with ancient is very good
I managed a 10/3 which was a fun one too.
> and couldn't believe my luck how I couldn't get 1 9/7  For anyone as moronic as this guy, the chance of a 9/7 is 0.07%, and 60,000 blue crystals gets you enough pheons for 784 stones. The chance of getting 0 9/7s in that time is 0.9993^784 = 57.7%  In other words, this guy had **slightly better than average luck** to "finally" get their first 9/7 after 60k blue crystals.  Don't be like this guy. Do math before gambling.
I wanna drop the character that I accidentally got a 9/7 on but I feel so bad for thinking that.

Teach me senpie😂
but before that l had my worst stone cutting like 3 months ago. I wanted to cut 7-7 on alt GS but l didnt consider buying both leg books then l ended up wasting 150k gold and more than 300 pheons on Grudge-Adre, l ended up with 8-7 but not worth at all.
Teach me senpie😂
Got motivated by this post 300 pheons wasted again not even 7/7😂
I didnt write it that clearly but my 1520 is now 1545 and 1415 is 1520. Hard to push the lower summoner fastly due to shards of course
Im not too sure, but it can certainly seem that way. I think my entire time playing, doing thousands of guardians I have maybe gotten 5 class books. With roughly 100 dispatches, I got about 4 legendary books, but then I've been dry on books for months now with dispatch.  It may have been ninja-nerfed.
Yes, it does. Every S or SS ránk is a guaranteed Epic or lego class book for that character's class. I could easily got 2-3 lego class books in a month with dispatching 2 ships daily.  Also, the GR's ilvl does not matter. I was 1415 and dispatched Velganos cause my ships / crew had a better success rate than on Deska. So as long the GR is dropping lego books, you're good.
Umm bro, both those engraves arent ideal for lvl 2 ancient 0.o, some of the worst ones even. You want the "7" of your 9/7 to be the engraving that sits at lvl 2 in your 5x3+2  EDIT: at least you can swap which stones to cut before you got it and realised
Same here.
Not really, gotta get that 5x3+1 early.
I don’t disagree. Literally crippled without high uptime crit synergies l, but with it’s the highest ceiling for what we currently have.
U have missed the part where I said I had like 11 9/6 and most were 1 off 25% chance for the last hit. Maybe I could have said it better. I know damn well I had better than average luck on that session.
Nah don’t feel bad. I just benched a 1520 with a 96 quality weapon. Don’t regret it one bit
Yeah my first thought was that the poor 1520 main summoner never saw a single hone again and the 1415 alt became the chosen one and is now 1545.
>I think you made it pretty clear about it
there was a rework some months ago that we got from KR, in the old system you were also guaranteed the guardian card on SS, this is not the case anymore. I would assume it lowered leg book chances when we got that update
I have had countless S and SS missions with no book at all. I also dispatch Velganos twice everyday with 100% and 93% adaptations.
They're talking about on ancient gear. If you really want both engravings at 3 then your ancient build is going to be cheap as fuck. 5/3 non-class accessories on ancients will be as worthless as 4/3s on relic.
A 10/6 definitly works for 5x3+2  with a 9/7, the 7 is your +2  with a 10/6, the 10 is your +2
?… why can’t you get 5x3+2 with a 10/6?
10  12+3  12+3  6+6+3  6+6+3  6+6+3
333332 works with 10/6 + ancient?
95+ quality weapon is much more of an inevitability than a 9/7 stone though. A single quality tap can happen so much more often and a 9/7 is around the same ballpark chance as outright 100 quality.
cause he’s pepega and can’t do basic addition math
Yes, the 10 has to be the +2. Like with 9/7 the 7 has to be.
okay and? That same logic applies for 9/7 with making sure the 7 is what you want as lv2 as well.   Still doesn't take away from the point that a 10/6 is an option for 5x3+2
he probably dismantled his 9/7 in disguise lmao
It is very viable. The rng part just makes it extra spicy......
"Give ten players of equal proficiency on equally geared (same quality and stat spread) using exact skill tree and engravings and they will have done different total damage at the end of a run against a same boss." - Korean Forum commentator while discussing class balance
I play Emperor. The RNG card draws don't really matter much. The only time it gets lousy is when you're holding a Joker card, and then you draw Pot of Greed, and you just know that one of your draws is gonna suck
arcana has 98 different builds and all of them are top tier dps and fun af at the same time its crazy
RNG aspect is overhyped.  It’s a squishy, high damage, interesting class.
S tier class on it's damage alone.  Add in 100% uptime on a crit synergy and honestly pretty easy arguments for the best class in the game.
Class is cracked
If you ignore the RNG aspect of cards altogether (literally never press them) it still does fairly competitive sustained damage. Cards are mainly there for burst potential.
arcana stronk
Has really high damage potential, but is probably the hardest class to play (at least empress).
It’s a fun class! But be warned, it’s definitely one of the more difficult to grasp and play at the highest level. That being said, some people derive enjoyment from difficulty. If that’s you, then go for it. Damage wise, it sits comfortably near the top of all classes if played decently well. There’s a lot of room for skill to grow which is great.   You get five more character slots to try other classes before committing to something so I’d definitely take that opportunity before going all in on Arcanist.   FYI: You don’t have to redo the story 5 times, there’s a technology called Knowledge Transfer later so focus on one character first until you unlock that.
Good Rng makes things more exciting. Bad rng doenst really impact my floor dps that much.  Playing emperor.
It's fun I have 3 at 1520 lol
Top three dps classes in the game on empress. Potentially the hardest class in game to play.
https://www.reddit.com/r/lostarkgame/comments/129peqg/arcana_vs_igniter_sorc_which_class_is_harder_to/jeom58x?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button
Hard to play but the most fun and dynamic fight. A lot of skills move her, she can buff herself. She got many viable builds so u can personalise,and not just 1 meta build but 5. Cheap to gear up. Hard to play super good but if u don't mind rng or to fail a lot it's good
Strong and rewarding class.  Dmg wise not S tier  The only way you beat surge,igniter is you get perfect cards
From my experience she's second place right after Reaper as a class where player makes the class. She pretty much has 3 performance modes "can't use dashes, faceplanted into a oneshot" floor PoV, "didn't bother learning the class min-max but geared af and can dodge" Below-average suckers and "The PUMPER" that deals 90% of his team's damage.   The difference between pumper Arcana and average Joe Arcana is that pumpers know how to mitigate impact of bad card RNG, while average Joes just go "well bad rng not my fault" while they do as much dps as their Bard.
It's great but I hate star card and teammates restoring mana. Wish they reworked nightmare set somehow...
It's one of the best dps currently, if played correctly
I did an empress arcanist with the latest express, and wow the fucking apm of this class combined with the burst damage. I'm in love with her playstyle and she is going to replace one of my main 6 for sure.
Arcana is currently one of the S+ tier classes and even with bad RNG she still tops the dps, with good RNG she's MVP guaranteed. That's for both EMP (Emporer and Empresses) builds.  Arcana requires a lot of investments, however. To reach that potential. Full Nightmare set, level 5 tripods and level 7 gems are the minimum she needs to start appearing on the MVP screen. She's also mechanically the most difficult class as she wants you to manage card RNG with very specific combos, but it's a very rewarding class.  Look up the community guides for Arcana for a more in depth analyses and build recommendations.
it's a great class to main  high skill cap and scales very well
I play emp cause I thought emp is more fun than emp. I sometimes press z and sometimes I press x. Most of the time I press the buttons.  The class is strong.
Just trust in the heart of the cards.
The worst thing is star, its literally negative dmg increase cause u need to maintain endless mana. Everytime i draw that card, i die a little bit inside
Emperor is more difficult imo due to the high swiftness piano fingers play style.
Any strong videos guides or builds you recommend?
Any guides builds or videos you can link to for emperor?
Classic Sorc player's take
now we even have artists too to restore our mana :D
They really need to rework that card
Memorizer92 on YouTube. He has videos for various arcana builds along with guides. If you follow his discord page also, he has all his builds and guides listed there.
Google arcanist community guide. Don’t have the link on hand
Classic judge by flair take. I just use Sorc flair because I like the class.   I main Bard/Artist and Arcana are by far the second highest floor PoV class I meet. I remember people that manage to get killed through shield and DR due to mispositioning and standing in all near omeshots and oneshots. Especially Valtan alt raids, Reaper and Arcana faceplanting straight into grab are not an unusual sight.
I still buy them for the gems and leapstones
Yes. You may need to join a different guild or just contribute more if you're not getting enough to buy the 3 punika and 3 south vern boxes.
Normal boss rush gives the same amount of gems as hard boss rush. So yes.
Even if you don't get tickets out of it (which are always good as they give gems and silver), you still get a bunch of silver from these chests. Honestly it's worth it for me and I feel like my silver income has gone up decently since I started getting them on my alts.
I even buy the t1 and 2 chests bc I need silver that badly x.x
I buy both tier 3, 2 and 1 on 8 char.  Last char is 1475 only so he buys normal silver chests instead of South vern chests. I also don't donate silver to guilds. Still manage to reach 550+ contributions.
I buy on non lvl60 alts so I cab squeeze out exp
Yup, in the worst case, if I brick 3x Hard Mode boxes and I want to Double Boss Rush Weekly, I can always do a Normal in a few minutes. I go for MHL and 6x Box and that’s it, one of my Lopang Alts usually goes for the Silver Chests.
Yes.   Boss rush for gems   Cubes for silver
I buy both chests + MHL + shards on my mains weekly
I buy them on all my eligible toons and run what drops every single week. I’ve had a natural 8 level 9’s this way. Only had to buy 3 to get a full 11.
I used to, but I've stopped doing it at this point. Going to put those bloodstones to use buying blue/red crystals instead.   It's still solid value for the gems, mind you, but I've got a long backlog of tickets on 16 or so characters and I need non-leap mats right now to hone 1560s.
I buy them all for silver + gems
i buy for silver
Some weeks I have enough so I buy them after buying the SV chests, the juice mat chests, and the MVL. The raw silver, silver from Cube tickets, and gems from Boss Rush make it worth it.
If you have the bloodstones, yes.  Everything in them is great. Whenever the cube update comes, they’ll convert into better tickets or more silver.
I dont
I don't even buy hm
yup
It gives literally same drop as hard ones... Like literally same amount of gems, also leapstones are basically same price in EU. So yeah, obviously worth It.
Ofc
Silver always in short supply, so I grab them if I got spare bloodstones around.
No because 10 chars are enough to keep me busy. Granted 4 of them don't do legions (well artist does clown) and only chaos and guardians, buying additional possible cubes or br on my main 6 is too much of a time sink.   Used to do it tho until one month ago. Incredible how each additional char seems little work at first but the mind toll is exponentially higher
I dispatch normal cubes on non-gold earning alts.  This makes them quite worth.    Priority is: Hard chest > Normal Chest > Juice boxes > Whatever else you need.    Sometimes I take: Sage's Powder, Marvelous, Silver boxes depending on the character, Destruction/Guardian stones.
If you contribute more (past 100%) you get more bloodstones?
Wtf I did not know this. Thanks !
Wait what? Same amount of the new leap stones?? I mean converting them get you less no?
Hidden sleeper strat, I do the same on my alts that aren’t 1490 yet because they have tons of bloodstones
yeah silver gain from these is already better than the silver chests (which I also buy) if I'm dispatching the tickets.  Card xp is also a nice bonus
Why tier 1 and 2 boxes?
Cubes for... saving to convert to the new cube tickets lol
Even if you don't do tickets now, you can trade them into Ebony cube tickets when that comes out.
No I meant if OP isn't reaching 100% which can happen if the guild sets the contribution limit to like 600. Its pretty easy to get enough bloodstones for the ticket boxes so either the guild is really stingy with weekly payouts or OP isn't contributing enough.
No. you don’t
I left guild a long time ago and not bother to join since 5 months ago, becuz they said will kick anyone isnt 100% contribution.
> gems
Better silver value than silver chests and at worst you get card xp from dispatching those tickets. Unless you have a loopang army or not 1-2 main focused, silver is unmaintainable.  My roster is 1560, 1556.6 (can force pity to 1560), 1550 x3, 1540 x2 (1 can be force pity to 1550), 1500 and 1475. Every single silver counts. I don't cut questionable bracelets, no gem rerolling etc.  Edit: Every char is doing rested cd and guardian raids. Beside 7, legion raids mostly skipped. Oreha/argos mostly skipped on all 9.
But then you have to run that. Also I've heard those are less valuable than current boss rush/cube and even moreso for the 1302 ones.
You also get less bloodstones if more people contribute. My friend has all his alts in our real-life friend guild and gets about 3800-4200 at the end of the week because there's like 30 alts reaching 100% contribution and splitting the pool. On his main, he gets like 10k because only 6 people in his main's guild gets to 100% a week.
I'm dumb XD
I have 4 1560s and 2 1550s now and I’m basically permanently at 0 silver after each day so I need all the silver I can get. I guess I know what chest I’m gonna buy later when I log back in
You can also exchange those tickets straight up for silver, at least that's what you could do in KR
That's likely because you have repeatable guild tasks such as sea coins. They work well for alt guilds that struggle to reach max level tasks, but in larger guilds completing them past level 5 does nothing for the guild and just pads everyones contrib so you get more shares of a smaller pie.  Silver donations are a big part of having a large bloodstone pool.
 >  he gets like 10k because only 6 people in his main's guild gets to 100% a week.  Then theres a ton of others contributing but not making the 100% cut because its toxicly high.  Contribution is linear to the effort put in, more people putting in effort = more stones = split evenly if everyone recheas contribution.
Any idea of the the silver per ticket? I imagine something like 40k, which is kinda meh.
No, nobody else plays the game on their guild. There's literally only 6 characters logging on not that it's high. Kind of weird to assume toxicity there lol.
The base amount is fairly significant + easy to do. Open guild menu + donate silver = baseline of 3k for every member. Then you can get 60-120k bloodstones for weekly raid/siege participation, split that between 20 people for 6000-9000 bloodstones weekly or 40 people for 4500-6000.  All this isn't even including the weekly guild tasks which are prob around an extra 15k bloodstones in an alt guild or 45k bloodstones in a main.   In a 6 character guild you'd prob do weekly raid for 20k bloodstones (skipping siege) + 15k weekly tasks for an extra 5800 bloodstone per member on top of the 3k base making it a fairly comfy 9k weekly bloodstones
It‘s around that yeah, 30-40k silver. I mean, better than nothing. Very nice for all the silver-starved people
Well, that's because pretty much no one is on T1/T2 content anymore. Don't expect to find many people around until you get to T3 content.
Almost all content below 1320 item level is dead content. Only used as quick grind for card packs. EU Central is more populated than EU West if you think about switching. Also good idea is using fast story event pass cus it gives gear to skip Honing, but it's only for 1 new character.
I would HIGHLY recommend starting over in EU Central. EU West is in an awful state, it's so bad that amazon has asked smilegate to develop region merge technology so they can integrate EUW into EUC lol.  However even on Central be aware that 99% of the player population is at 1400+ gearscore. It is very unlikely you can find people to play with before reaching the punika continent and unlocking tier 3.
People are doing low tier dungeons on EUC but keep in mind that the vast majority of people who are running these are much higher in itemlevel, which means they'll breeze through those dungeons and one-shot every boss so you wouldn't really get a feel of actually being a support.
go to EUC, unfortunately im trapped on EUW and regions dead second it hits 00:00
idk what i was expecting lol
One of the worst presentation of low level experience that should be used to make lasting impressions, worsened by the compounding factor of bot army, poor translation (am Korean immigrant; can't make account in KR since I can't verify my identity in Korea lol) with anecdotal encounters against rude high-level player.    Instead, play the much-better full version of Leonheart ("Prideholme") Stronghold song.
ok, but who asked?
?
Do you think low level segment at Lost Ark feels acceptable? It leaves poor impression to new players, which a f2p game always needs to try fishing up more paying customers instead of hoping for a whale with sunk cost fallacy.    I would not have made to T3 and doing legion raids if my friend didn't start a new char and sat through the experience.
When I first started the game I loved the story and did every single island I could before I even made it to t3. Music and visuals were great and I was having a good time overall. The shift from story focus to daily grinds was different but the quality of the raids made up for it. Nowadays the new player experience is going to be plagued by infinite bots everywhere but you are able to hone up to t3 fairly fast and with no gold cost. Being unable to experience the early abyssal dungeons on ilvl is unfortunate as phantom palace and the water one were some of my favorite moments in the game when I started. Even the early guardians like vertus were amazing to me because no one had a great idea of what they were doing and every time vertus dove in the ice and reappeared it sounded like a jump scare.   The early game itself to me was enjoyable but it may be different with it being a ghost town aside from bots. There’s no perfect way to get a massive surge of new players on any one server that would make t1-t2 active but the quick push to t3 allows them to join the majority of the playerbase faster. The issue then becomes the party finder as the majority of players do not look to optimize their character builds and do cosmetic damage as they were completely fine in whatever build they were using up to that point. The greatest thing they can do is use the community class guides and find a good guild or use the learning raid discords. The majority of players will never hear about these resources or bother to look for them and will spend hours in party finder unable to join raids until they quit the game or buy a bus which kills their first experience. Once players hit t3 I think they should be given a notice about these resources to make their experience as smooth as possible.
I though I bought so so many fish when they were cheap but ended up just using it up for myself. Kinda insane that people still have so many to sell, must’ve bought way more than me
[Agreed.](https://b.cgas.io/ao1-GmekJi6P.png)   Seen someone with 10m on this sub a good while ago, he's probably quite happy about this.
I see a ton of bots fishing everywhere. The owner of those accounts is probably rolling in it.
Are fish going to go up after hard brel release?
Nice! 10mil is wild lmao
jfc thats like 20m worth of fish?  or close to 30 ig
Most of the time people talking about fish stonks are the people that bought them while they were cheap. Not people gathering them to sell.  There was a (rather substantial) period of time where fish were selling for 1g. People that played that market game are doing rather well for themselves.
Yeah unfortunately this isnt a guy who actually played the game. He just bought botted fish and is bragging about how much gold he made. Kinda cringe tbh.  Edit: Please downvote me more RMT gold suppliers. Flipping is and always has been giga cringe in every game 😍 Doubly true when u are buying from botfarms.
People are gonna try to push for +25 Ancient weapon so the prices just gonna increase more and more
Yeah and who knows how high it'll go with Brel HM. I'm pretty excited to cash out and properly juice up my roster. That guy must be stoked if he's still sitting on that giant pile.
My problem is I was doing that before the 10 second limit. Then the limit was introduced and it got annoying, so i stopped and sold. I made a decent profit, but nothing like this shit. 30x vs 300x is a huge difference. My panties are chapped even though I didn't lose.
Yeah back when the game first launched and supply was massive I just spent a ton on fish when they were like 4g
Mfw I'm cringe  ![gif](giphy|94EQmVHkveNck|downsized)
Ehh. I agree with flipping abusing bots, but I don't see an issue with investing low and selling high with normal demand spikes. Things like buying great honors/basic orehas before artist release and selling them bc of demand is fine in my book. It's always a risk since random shit can mess with the market (like the gold nerfs to Argos and Oreha).
Has nothing to do with people. It's only about bots. They fish, there are alot of them,its just question of when and for how much they will start to sell.
Nah its still pretty bad. Flippers are generally top 1% players and the people buying mats during spikes are normies who dont really stay informed on the game.  So you're basically moving gold from casuals to top 1%ers. Not really great for the game.
I feel like that's going to happen regardless of flipping.  People who prepare and buy shards ahead of time (pretty sure they'll spike with brel hard once enough people get ancient gear to hone).  Will sell their excess shards then, even if they had no intention to flip. Your always going to give more gold to the knowledgeable players.
They changed tickets a while ago to expire the same week you got it, but you can try it on Tuesday night.
Who are you getting ahead of? You need 8 ppl for a raid
Playing 5D chess?
 Bro knows who asked
Yup I already tried this doesn't work tried it with argos on weekly reset your ticket just vanish
Do a search in game for it.  Look at recently sold as well.   It has some value since its good, but for relic users the stats are too low on an argos necklace to use. Can easily gain +50/50 stats on a diff necklace.
People will buy it. I assume it's a few thousand gold. May take a while to sell since most people are rocking free 4x3 and relic necks are probably the most important piece in terms of which piece to get legendary and which to get relic
sold similar on monday for 2k
maybe a new player will buy it.  I would look for those engravings on rings or earrings if it were legendary.  the stats difference is huge between legendary and relic on necklaces.
I'm sure you could get 2-5k for it people often cheap out on their supports but still will try for 5x3.  I've sold 3 different legendary accessories recently for 5k each.  Just throw it up for a reasonable price and it should sell.
the rings are the biggest catch from argos cuz you can have a small-ish loss of swift while going for 5x3 or ez 4x3+1/2
delete this now
Most people don't play their class to max potential and never will so I don't get the whiny bellyaching about it being trash just because it's not top tier. Imo the changes were really nice and helped the flow of the rotation. The best change though was being able to cast the hawk during holding skills.
I think many people already knew SS was very reliable DPS, just now they got much better
Not really a secret in my opinion. Sharpshooter has been doing crazy numbers in hell mode, lots of 3+ mil DPS in valtan which is not easy for a lot of classes. Really strong class for equalized right now
no it’s not… *wtf man shut it*
Our guilds SS has been popping off since the update. Unironically one of our top DPS now along with other S-tier classes.
The class is good but it won’t be popular. It is like the artillerist, top tier damage but unpopular still since people don’t really like the playstyle.
My favorite alt. It’s really fun and easy to play because it’s a hit master class with huge range and the damage is not even bad
It's hard to build when the starting player base is so low to begin with, then there are less accessories and less tripods on the market compared to sorcs berserker or other higher played classes.
Honestly im not really happy about this update. All we got is like 10% dps increase, LC got more build options and they made ds rotation super hard to pull off. Still happy about the dps increase but they didn't have to treat ds like that and most important they didn't fix any of SS issues and after we got this update there is no hope they will get fixed anytime soon. SS still has mana problems, still has long af animation locks without any super armor and the dmg even after buffs is still not great.
Doesn't have booba and some people don't like the bird
As someone who played SS through every variation possible throughout Lost Ark history in other regions, current version of both DS and LC is the best SS has ever been. Both DS and LC have multiple variation you can play and honestly all of them work to the same level and will perform the same. Only difference is the skill-ceiling and difficulty of playing where LC gets a big advantage due to its simplicity and consistency, but my main problem with all LC builds is exactly that, being easy, repetitive and becomes boring very quickly.  DS on the other hand has been my personal favorite due to seeing bigger crit numbers, difficulty of playing where you need to be focused through the most of the fight to maximize DPS efficiency. I like challenging builds that perform well the better you play and DS will definitely give you that if you're into it. I wouldn't recommend it for new players, but if you have enjoyment from playing challenging build to perfection then by all means give it a shot, since its the cheaper class engraving nowadays where the books are around 100-200g each.
I've switch from full swift to 50/50 spec crit and every time I play him I'm completely blown away by how much of a glow up he got, my man went from "deleted as soon as Aeromancer comes out" to actually a fun and solid character to play.
Damage is fine, but you don't get big crits. But really the biggest problem with SS isn't the damage, it's how it plays. Half the skills get interrupted by a sneeze and they aren't quick animations. Running out of mana is not a joke and even with a support I'll tell my group I'm out of mana constantly. It's just got a lot of basic problems with the class that make it frustrating to play at times.  Caliligos is a fucking nightmare as a SS. Constant AoE thunderbolts and mass AoE attacks everywhere that interrupt half of your skills.
My friend is joking about how Sharpshooters are hiding damage because we aren't showing up on the DPS tierlists, meanwhile my SS almost always tops damage now... so they are pretty strong, but still not has good as arcana and arti though.
hawk shot over arrow rain was a crazy buff
Its good but not S tier. Problem is not enough tripods on the market, and not enough supply of class engraving accessories since no1 plays hunter. Also wouldnt say its unknown since the 50/50 60/40 crit spec builds were out, the accessory prices have gone sky high
Since the update I have been playing SS Sharpshooter and finding it very reliable.
Its a very strong consistent damage class with a very high skill floor. Spec build bird alone is like CO Summoner pets but even easier to play with equal or higher damage.   You see it in hell mode a lot since consistent damage there is king due to inflated hp pool. But in overgeared content it suffers the same weaknesses all consistent damage classes have.  If I had to rate LC SS it would probably next to PM Gunslinger. Its easier to play but has a worse synergy both have high consistent damage.
Most people who play SS already know it's very strong now with Spec LC but because the class' animations and general gameplay still look like trash and dated, nobody wants to play it so it'll probably keep on going as a "secret".
All the KR SS have been keeping this shit quite for a reason.  Delete now before nerf!
It's a now a good A tier consistent damage class only slightly weaker than the revamped Mayhem Zerker. That's assuming you're going Spec.
Like they only got a 10% damage boost with the change  The thing was swiftness classes are hard for max uptime. Most players can't handle the spam while dodging the least possible simple as that. Since the Crit/spec 50/50 exists now, it's takes a lot less effort compared to full tryhard swiftness uptime to do the same damage.  In short the floor is closer to its ceiling for a crap ton less effort which the average DPS of LC SS is extremely decent even for bad players   The ceiling isn't high. Actual good players on meta classes will beat you but these people are the ones that are actually able to get MVP damage in hell content (consistent content) and or is a heavy burst class on super over geared content  Small edits
feels nicer? the feeling has not changed at all
It’s not really a secret. Busted in hell and in regular content.
My 1530 LC 50/50 crit spec full salvation was cruel fighter mvp enjoyer in Brel G6 last week. There were bunch of 1550's and they were also surprised so much :) He became one of my fav's after the patch :)
It’s less awful than before but still nowhere close to the top spec classes.
Why did you feel the need to specify LC? Both specs are better. DS has definitely become harder to play, but you get rewarded even more for playing it well.
Nah. It is just a mid level DPS after the patch. Can't compete with sorc, arcanist, surge etc...
Not a secret, just a boring ass class to play.
Yeah sharpshooter broken, artilerist not though, buff arti plz :)
Because there are like 3 people playing it. They and others knew about it been shouting for a bit but nobody heard them.
Been playing lc starting from 290g for their book and now people starting to realise and see his potential kekw. But dont make it obvious please, i need more buff from smilegate.
Day 1 SS main- I think SS has always been overlooked and underestimated. I dont think there's any secret, I think there are just a lot of meta chasers and bandwagon players that can't just discover it themselves without hearing about it from others first
The only thing keeping Sharpshooter from being a popular class is a gender change. If it was a female archer it would be one of the most popular classes hands-down.     It was always a very solid DPS, now it's just better.
don't tempt me, I WILL make a new character and put myself through even more suffering
I always thought SS did great damage before, it's just that it's a very unpopular class
yeah it does a lot more damage. very solid for sure.  too bad the playstyle didnt change and its actually more paint-dry levels of boring now without 1700 swift to at least let u spam your kinda boring ass abilities. hawkshot does look pretty nice at least.  Mine is staying in the lopang gulag though.
What are the notable differences between the builds? I’ve been hoping for the female bow-using class eventually but with the current updates to LC SS I’m itching to give the class a shot right now
The problem is that the swift LC build became less ideal. I don't hate SS  but I mostly played it cause I liked how the full swift LC build felt before. I can still get by but I cycled him out of my main 6 cause I know the dps potential is not being reached.
the class has been a top tier dps forever im pretty sure people are paid by someone to deny it
Old outdated class got giga buffed. Something new? Same happened to scrapper and artillerist before. Ss wasn't very popular, isn't flashy, isn't tier1 dps, so ppl didn't hop on ss train, obviously.
SS have been stealing mvp almost every time I’ve seen one. Definitely slept on
I have a feeling most sharpshooters are waiting for ancient gear to swap builds, why would they re-buy accessories only to replace them again in a couple of months.
Yeah the damage is insane now, even in this thread you see people underrating it.
Yep, recently made my SS and have been absolutely loving it.
How does Swift LC feel? I've been thinking about trying him out tbh, but it seems like a low APM class. Kinda hoping his swift build is spammy
The real tragedy is death strike. Last time I saw the books were below 100g. If you want a very cheap and solid 5x3 make a DS
As some people still claim, SS is trash and we are in need of more buffs!! /s  Source: me with 6 SS roster
My guild always makes fun of my SS lol
&#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/87cszxqe7gsa1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7515fe67e6ed323cc08460685a6a4f19c26a9486
I played lc swift before and i am still very happy. Smooth gameplay and decent, consistent damage. Easy to build 5x3 on all builds. What else can you ask for?
please remove this post, l've manage to gear my SS quite cheap and l'd like to keep it that way in case l switch build to full swift
I would play female ss with slayer model. You know... The Danika style. Futuristic guy with a robo bird is not interesting for me.
Cries in DS
the best change was a single hit sniper shot.
> Imo the changes were really nice and helped the flow of the rotation.   *cries in DS*
It's completely broken right now. Not weak at all.
The update brought the damage ceiling up a decent bit, but the damage floor is what rocketed up (for LC sharpshooter). The averagely skilled SS player is doing a lot more damage now. It's a pretty easy class to play now, compared to before.  We don't see em cause not many people have made them lol. Same as artillerist. Give it a few months I'm sure they'll become more common.  This is also part of what makes them really good in hell mode btw, uptime is very easy to maintain when something like 20% of your damage is automatically hitting the boss for you and the rest of your skills can be used at long range. It also doesn't rely on any hard stat breakpoints or lvl 9 cooldown gems.
Was reliably trash before
[removed]
Yea everyone is playing ss in hell right now
it took over summoner as the new fotm class lol
3m+ on g2?
Yea fr
Playstyle? I called balls. Female classes aren't more popular cause they have better playstyles, I can assure you
cawk\* please, be respectful of its rightful name
Yeah DS is pretty high maintenance now more than ever but I love it. Been mpv like 99% of the time in all my raids these past 2 weeks. Feel like the only gate ss is pretty bad on is Brel g1 since it’s literally a trixion boss. Think I was mvp on all the other gates every single time on my 6 1540+ DS SS. It’s actually crazy the amount of dmg you can pump now if you know what you are doing. I’m playing the 6 skill variant with claymore and it PUMPS.  Kinda happy how everyone says it’s shit so I’m happy to get another buff. Feels like we have been getting huge buffs every balance patch and people still saying DS is smoge. I mean the books are literally 50-100g right now and it’s actually baffling to me how this spec is so under appreciated.
I made a swift/crit build with 2 NM 4 dom a few months ago, it's pretty chill to play, and it still does damage ahead of most other similarly-geared pugs. It might not be full optimal DPS right now, but it's close enough, and it partially or completely smoothes over those issues.
Cali is a skill issue and running oom is a build issue, everything easily fixed.
LC is very high on certain tier lists from he who must not be named
>Like they only got a 10% damage boost with the change  Where did you pluck this from? Hawkshot instead of arrow shower/deadly slash already gives more than a 10% damage boost to LC's overall DPS.  Going from full swift LC to crit/spec is a significant damage increase. Plus the changes to the meter can great
Zerk being one of the most popular class in the game: ???
A lot has changed.  Atomic arrow now applies damage amplification on hit, meaning you don't have to time your big hitting skills when the atomic arrow explodes.  New skill Hawk Shot & meter gain changes. You no longer need to use deadly slash to gain meter as it is also low damage skill and can now switch to evasive fire for more damage, replace as a counter, and use as movement skill. Hawkshot is now your damage AND meter building skills.  Changes to the meter gain means 100% uptime on loyal companion. Whereas before you had about 30-45s downtime of no LC after it ends (until you build it again and because of the CD of your awakening).  Spec now scales with LC. The highest/optimal build is now Spec/Crit LC. Which is a HUGE difference from swift/crit LC.  There are even more changes that makes the feeling and play style drastically different. So I dont understand what you mean by the feeling has not changed????
Yeah I cringe a bit every time I hear any SS player says how much more fun it is post patch.  It's literally identical the numbers are just bigger lol. I guess people really care about mvp.
Cause you’re playing with a bunch of shitters that doesn’t know how to play their classes optimally. Will never catch an SS same ilevel, gems, gears, etc getting cruel fighter mvp over my Deathblade. Never.
The reward is 10% DPS increase but that assuming that all your last rush/meter gain hits  and you don't miss your big hitters. Missing anything crucial will be below LC. Need near perfect play to be ahead which the average player for sure can't do and be like 10-20% lower than LC.  LC is just too brain-dead simple to do well on vs. DS
SS itself isn't a burst class even though they have changed it to spec class, you are comparing a constant dps class with burst class which is weird
Female SS will be a support class mark my words /s
All 3 builds of SS are pretty "consistent" with swift LC being the most consistent, spec LC being sort of bursty just because the cooldowns are long but skills hit hard, and Death strike having to fit all your skills in an (I think) 8 second window, which the gameplay is still bursty, but with little downtime.
Death Strike got new skill that replaces its weakness (the spinning blade one). There are some variations of DS too. Claymore one (without counter) is the strongest, while counter one is doing 3% less dmg Iirc. Claymore is also tricky to use since front attack modifier. You can use it without too. Good chunk of dmg.  Another DS Claymore weakness is too short burst window I guess? Personally I don't like Claymore one and I'm using counter still. Trying to fit every skill in 8sec without dashing is easy to do, but while dodging you can lose a lot of dmg.  Anyway. Highly recommended class, nice constant burst, pretty smooth class.   I didn't play LC yet. If you like bow classes, try it!
Because the SS you play with are more dedicated to their class, are better at the game and probably better gears than you. People I know who play SS are more skilled than average players. It’s not the class. Even Tofuenn who is an above average SS player gets made fun of by other Korean players that plays stronger classes such as Artillerist and gunslinger.
Funny guy over here. “Decent” quality ancient acc will only be available to the biggest of belugas for a good half year.
if you like slow just go crit spec lc. swift is nice bc CD are longer than most swift classes if when full swift. I like both builds tbh
Yeah the single hit is nice, but the animation and sound is ass now in my opinion. Felt way better before
As someone who just has a low ilvl sharpshooter, what’s so crazy about that anyway?
Im playing DS and the best addition was Hawk Shot, so i dont have to go into melee range anymore to fill meter. DS is absolute bonkers and feelsgood right now...
It's far from broken though, unless you know some new tech I haven't heard of yet
Was never trash lol but I guess not everyone can reliably look at info and make correct judgments

Yeah a friend of mine was doing 3.1-3.2 on Loyal g2 no atros
I have hopes  that eventually they make DS scale with spec so we can have an ultimate burst  spec build that  can rival other  spec classes.
ss ooming on 1.6 rotations is a design issue
I mean vast majority of other classes don't care about random damage interrupting half their skills and don't have to eat mana food or equip a bunch of focus runes
From Tofuen, Civo community guide. It is a 10% dmg buff and nothing else.  Also, DS got screwed with the clunky playstyle, LC got better with 50/50 crit spec and from the rumors in KR they are planning to kill swift LC
The other person answered.   You also took a -6% damage from the LC engraving itself. Also data I got from a friends holy bible for even more confirmation from my runs   I was playing the upper limits of what full swift allowed optimizing mana usage to the point of removing moving slash having deadly slash at 1 etc  to get most out of it.   Like I said Crit spec is a lot easier to reach said ceiling what full swift allowed with a lot less effort   The other reason why you feel you got a big DPS increase was fast fire got buffed. If you been playing full swift with fast fire before the patch you are doing 6-8% less damage overall than steady aim. It was very hard to keep everything on cooldown with it but it still gave a increase in damage even if you been slightly off. Fast fire/steady aim is within like 1% if you have around 50% Crit on current patch compared to the big difference before  If you been using fastfire before you got more than 16-18% after patch on both builds
I thought 99% of them were bots
Sorc and artist right now would like a word. So would bards and dbs
Bots. And 90% of real Zerks will be abandoned once Slayer comes out.
In all fairness Asmongold running a Berserker back in the day being 100-300 ilvl higher than the abyss he was running, obviously top dps's and shouting "stand in fire dps higher" stuff made a lot of people roll one.
My Fenrir downtime has not changed at all, been about 8 seconds with full swift build, so you're not correct about the 30-45sec downtime.
swiftness lc already had 100% uptime and you should still be using deadly slash cause evasive fire is a meme and would force you to take silver master on hawk shot
I just like using hawk shot way more than arrow rain. The rotation feels way smoother now with hawk skill being able to be used while charging other skills.
Who are you? Avengers or something? I bet I can easily beat your 1530 DB in G6 with same ilevel, gems, gears etc. :)
DS is still way easier to play than tons of different burst classes. Its also hit master, so its really not as bad as you are making it sound. LC is just completely braindead so DS seems "hard" in comparison. LC players also arent perfect, I hope you realize. At the end of the day its just different playstyles for different kinds of people. Sharpshooter after the rework is better as a whole, not just for LC.
NO. Those burst classes still do more consistent damage than SS. Go see the 3 min trixion compare
Nah, I want it to be super fast. I enjoy my Emperor Arcanist, for example. I know SS won't ever be that fast, but something along those lines woulda been neat
I totally agree! They kept the same sound and everything. So it still sounds like a multi-hit but they sped up the sound to try to make it sound like a single hit. It is very lazy and feels bad.     It should have been reworked instead they just bandaid it.
The truth is if you play Spec LC you're basically playing a beastmaster in WoW. A good amount of your damage is from your bird which auto attacks. It's the ultimate brain dead class now.
The critical difference is landing the shot. For instance, if you are charging your sniper shot when the boss is about to phase or jump away, you can do the full damage of your skill. Whereas, when it was multi-hit, only the first hit would land thus doing only 1/3 of the damage.  Now it doesnt happen often, but it has happened to me enough times where I notice that it is an issue that doesnt need to exist.  From a gun/sniper/any irl perspective. Why TF is a sniper shot multi hit anyways? Have you ever seen a sniper rifle shoot 3 bullets at once? because that is called a shotgun and it is not even the same realm of rifles. It just simply doesnt make sense for that skill to be 3 hits. None of gunslinger's rifle skills hit multiple times per shot.  Visually, with a single hit you get to see "bigger" numbers even though in actuality, youre doing the same damage EXCEPT for the aforementioned edge case. Before with triple hits, you "see" something like 20m 16m 22m stacked on top of eachother whereas now youll see 58m.     **ADD:** yes i understand its a bow/arrow and not a sniper rifle. It still doesnt make sense, have you seen somebody fire a bow and all three arrows hit the same target? of course not, thats impossible. How this skill could stay multi-hit and a bow/arrow type skill is that SS will shoot the triple arrows out and the arrows flare outwards but also are homing arrows that track the target.
What "info" are you reliably looking at broski?  I've played it since launch. LC was in a garbage state before patch. Buff was huge.
Tofuens community guide has lots of incorrect things in it. It presents full spec as a build when it's worse than 50/50 crit/spec in quite literally every way lol
What rumors are you talking about?   I think if that is true, lots people will be unhappy about that. I understand spec/crit is more damage, but I'm choosing to stay swift because I really dislike the spec playstyle and I've learnt that I just can't play spec classes due to them being too slow. Killing spec means killing the class for some people.
No, people roll zerker because they class fantasy of a big ass dude with a big ass weapon is cool to a lot of people. If destroyer had been out in release there would be a lot more of them but they released after zerker gate keeping and people stayed away.
No Fenrir uptime may not have changed for you but you also don't require to use awakening to maintain hawk. So now you use 1 silver master tripod at level 1, once per 40 sec to maintain full gauge meter.  That can be any of the lv1 silver master tripods. I personally use moving slash and then atk speed tripod on hawkshot instead of silver master.
The perma hawk meter, instant party buff and weak point on atomic arrow and much wider arrow wave are all really nice and appreciated changes aswell
Get to 1590 first with full level 10 gems and then message me
Both are for sure better it just the fact you dealing with way more restrictions for little gain. Like yeah both get hit but it's a lot more punishing if you get hit on DS during your window where you can't really control it like some of the actual burst classes can where they can succeed easily at.   I still want DS buff to be like 10s and or even if last rush missed self buff.   Edit I still consider DS a consistent class because it barely bursts higher
So what if it isnt top tier? By your standards, there shouldn't be anybody playing any other class besides Arcana, Barrage Arty, and Summoner.
You clearly have no idea what is constant dps and burst dps
Ah I misread and thought you were *looking* for slow APM swift classes. Adren full swift with dom+nightmare is pretty damn spammy. Doesn't hit that reflux or arcana speed but it definitely scratches the ADHD itch
>It is very lazy and feels bad.  SG approach to SS in general TBH
It was always a single hit it was just visually displayed as multiple for whatever reason. There are many cases of abilities like this, snipe just didn't make sense as one. You could never only hit a single "hit" of snipe, you've also never only crit a single hit of snipe, it was all one hit.
No, it presents all LC builds variations.   Full spec is not that bad
I've read that from the sharpshooter channel in LA official discord.    That smilegate is slowly changing the class so people don't rage, but the idea is probably move it away from swift.     I can't prove this is true tho is was spoken by someone else. So take it with a grain of salt.
I don't and never used awakening. Full swift was enough to keep the downtime that low.
Cap. I did 87m with my Snipe to Hard Vykas G3 during swamp phase with DS full crit build. You’re playing it wrong or just saying stuff from what you believe to be true.
If you don't wanna play support a class that offers crit is always good (striker, gs, wardancer)
As Dragoniir said, a good support (especially bard) is a great duo, especially if they work to play around the Arti.   If you want to play a DPS rather than support, Arti benefits a lot from having a friend with a crit synergy such as Gunslinger, Arcana, Wardancer, etc.
Depends on what you want to play. If you want to play support then the 2 best sups for arti are Swiftness Bard and Artist.  Artist is the only class that can dmg buff for the entire wheelchair - ult - wheelchair combo.   Bard has a much larger dmg buff but for only half of the wheelchair - ult - ... combo. However Bard is vastly superior when it comes to protecting arti with shields and debuff immunity. You want to be able to sit through boss' attack patterns when you are in your  wheelchair, that's why you need good shields.  When it comes to synergies with other dds, then atk/mov speed and crit synergie are the best.   Wardancer has even both in its kit.
Whatever class you enjoy playing the most.  Don't worry about it.
Support or wardancer
If your  friend is going barrage and you want to play a dps, a swiftness Wardancer is amazing. Giving a massive crit buff (well, boss debuff) in roar of courage plus an attack and move speed buff in wind's whisper is really nice on barrage (my barrage artilleristis easily my slowest character). I think the meta build is 50/50 spec/swift 4 spender eso wardancer, but first intention still builds 1600 swift. If you want to play support, then bard is best. Basically just cast your 3 bubble buff every time you see him enter his barrage mode.   If he's going fire power, then really anything is fine. Firepower is pretty self sufficient and the high uptime of skills makes synergies a bit less important since you don't have big burst windows.
Get something with crit synergy, like wardancer or gunslinger.
From what i heared and read pocket spec bard is one of the best dua for artillerist especialy barrage artilerist. Syncing buffs with wheel chair dishees out big numbers :D  Edit : i think artist is simmiler to bard as well at least with buff timing but it boost dmg less then spec bard because artist over all work worse on spec and goes on full swift
I’m going to provide my perspective and what i think is the most underrated class to pair with a Barrage Arti. That is RE Blade. And that’s due to their party buff that increases attack speed and move speed. Especially when that Blade lines up their buff when I’m in Barrage mode. I get through my rotation so much easier and quicker with them. If he’s playing barrage and If you don’t mind playing RE, i suggested going that route. It will make a huge difference
Spec bard to juice him up ;)
If you wanna play support its gonna be EXTREMELY valuable for the first couple months of play. Ideally pick Paladin or Artist if you're "casual" or Bard if you wanna tryhard.  Otherwise mostly any dps will do really well, I personally recommend Summoner, Sorceress, Scrapper or Glaivier, as they're not mega tryhard classes, and thus will be really solid for a new player - you're gonna be doing a lot of new content in the beginning, and these classes just adapt to it alot better. Wardancer will be kinda useless unless you grind ALOT and do everything in the game - I see many recommending her, but she requires you to do a lot of extra content to be strong dps including a lot of time-gated content.
Leveled my Artillerist with my husband's Warddancer and oh damn it was fast.  Plus, I can shield him.
Striker is fake crit synergy. Very low uptime. Wd in dps builds got not good (still better than striker) uptime too. If something I mean actual good dps builds, not some zdps fi cringe.
I believe striker is a self crit buff
FI WD does that buff better *and* gives a crit rate buff...
Leveling has nothing to do with actual game tho. I doubt you even had a single synergy skill on panel or actually ever needed it since mobs die in one hit anyway.
U kno FI has the highest uptime with their buffs. They only play like 2pc entropy sometimes.
It’s not
Wardancer winds whisper only gives 8% attack speed. Maelstrom gives 20%. So no it’s not better. It just has more uptime.
And your point is? Because we do our Chaos dungeons and Guardians pretty quickly, as well.
Still zdps?? Lol
Well, you can pick the tripod to double the bonuses on wind's whisper, but I think the cooldown one is taken. A max swiftness FI wardancer can get CDs as low as 10 seconds on the buffs, so I think the uptime is worth it.
Point is, synergy ofc. You leveled fast because... Leveling is actually fast, not because your classes covered each other weakness.
He mentioned their uptime isnt good as well. But it is.
Okay, but let's be real - nobody cares about FI wardancers. Nobody will ever refer to FI when they say "wd", just like nobody ever refers to Control when they talk about Glaiviers. You can even tell he's talking about DB strikers if you know just a little bit about Strikers.
I said uptime in dps builds. If you want to play zdps builds but with crit debuff uptime it's up to you.
The only uptime that isn't good for wd is 3 and 4 spender. 2spender hs great uptime too
Great, now we have some bozo that's still recommending the Maxroll build that died for a very good reason. Hopefully nobody goes out and does a fuckton of horizontal only to make character that is useless post-1520.
You realize 2s and 3s have virtually the same dps? The only difference is burst vs. more consistent damage spread and using domfang instead of hallucination
What a weirdo, it didn't die, more builds became available because of bracelets and spec break points.
I enjoy saint's content but making a reddit post to boast his achievement on his behalf is kinda yikes.
Is this what a simp is?
[removed]
Isnt his group kinda of cracked gamers like cpt.jack lustboy, portia lmao. Kinda weird post
This is the kind of guy who come into saint's chat and being so dumb asking "so have you identified who's the weakling in the team?"
This post is up there with the guy stating that Zeal did the 2 SNIFFA to drop hints about Aero is coming soon.  Jfc, streamers are the people entertaining you, not your lord and savior.
did saint even show up on the MVP screen wdym hard carrying dps, also he's far from the first person to clear g5 three times.
Hey nonbinary, been a while. Gona get this account negative karma banned too?
Cleared g5 3 times and g6 3 times i suppose? Or whats the point? Sounds like those weird NBA record statlines like only guy to get 42/16/7.
Yikes.
What the actual....this is a troll post right?
Lol this isn't an achievement. He made a great effort but ultimately lost the race unfortunately. Had fun watching his attempts.  Moreover, why you, a complete random, needs to make a post on reddit for an irrelevant achievement on his behalf is really really cringe.
Never in the history of gaming has three clears been considered as an achievement. Worlds first has the glory.
Twitch ruined games
reaper alt account?
I dunno man, people call me troll but I take troll over simp any time if you ask me (side note: if inferno mode gives rewards just as hard mode, people farm the shit out it every week and call it “homework” trust me)
Not sure why you would call it "first person in the world" since only KR has hell Brel.   Not like the rest of the world has access to it.  Tittle should read: "first person in KR"
the simping is real
Is this satire?
You make the best copypastas bro I love you
Cringe ngl
These are the type of people that follow cult leaders.
Saint is the only big streamer with this amount of dickriding and it clearly shows.   I feel bad for him, he's become a magnet for people like OP. Mans just chilling and he gets cringe people like you ruining his rep.
The team that cleared didn't need to clear g5 3 times...  I watch saint and KR players as little as possible. He's playing a version of the game that's better, and will always be better than our version. As part of the global audience, we're also actively excluded from that version of the game. There will never be a race to WORLD first as they've stated there will always be a delay. It'll always be a race between teams in KR.
Ah a true simp, an probably a bot!
Maybe saint should make an onlyfan afterall
i farted 3 times while writing this..
Uh I wouldn't call sorc bad when there's an MVP vod of a clear on igniter sorc while also having black and white star
I find it funny that half the comments call OP a simp for making this post on Saint's behalf without realizing that it's troll since being back-to-back-to-back G5 champion just implies you couldn't finish G6.
\^ this ... I watch saint regularly and been sub for more than a year but this op post is weird...
I instantly recognized him when I read the title. Even the username is obvious. Dude must really have nothing better to do with his time.
Your post has been removed because it violates our Rules and Guidelines in /r/LostArkGame.  Removed for Rule 1:   >Behave yourself.  For clarification on each rule, please read the sidebar or visit the [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/lostarkgame/wiki/rules).
How is he the first person when his team mates exists.
well they said themself they lack consistency and not skill or dmg. They often were way ahead of time
I'd say the Sniffa post was actually funny, this one is just kind of sad.
Lol but in honesty Zeals never said anything about Aeromancer release that post was so random 😂
I think his point is Saint didn't clear first but he did it 3 times so pls praise him for coming in second and doing 1 gate 3x
Who says hes a complete random? Could just be saint.
You know what's even more cringe though? Being such a salty sailor that when someone complements someone else you immediately have to put an end to it.   Now that's some peak insecurity.   The comments on this thread are more telling than OPs post ngl.
No they didn’t? They help out small creators get their game out there
Another interesting question: Was he alive at the end of each clear?
He didn't clear yet as far as I know, so not even confirmed second.
Lol...
No one is salty, this is just the worst way to compliment someone. Saint was cringed tf out after hearing about this post on stream. OP shits on every one of the raiders in Saint's group. And there was nothing genuinely true in this post other than they cleared G5 3 times, and probably not the first to do that either.
Lol this is one of the worst ways to "compliment" someone. You must have some warped definition of that if you think this is fine. This comment tells me all I need to know about you. Not to mention you don't know shit about the context of this post originally which was mentioned by someone below.
See I didn't know any of that. I'm also not an expert on that part of the community and who or why this would be important so I'll concede on that front.   But the comment you made originally was that it's cringe to complement a stranger. I don't think that complementing a stranger is a bad thing. I find it kin to being excited about your sports team winning or something. It has nothing to do with you, but as a supporter it's exciting.   So without context I found it weird that it made you upset that someone would publicly congratulate a streamer.   But yeah with the background info I understand where you are coming from.
I wasn't the person you originally replied to but yeah rereading the original post, it sounds almost normal when you don't have the context most of us have.    And I think most of us also recognized that the person who made the post is on an alt account because he got banned from posting on his main (where a lot of his posts would have a weird obsession over Saint).
Ah got it.
You need at least item level 1375 to be able to sell them now, this is a measure to combat bots.
Gotcha. My highest is 1338 so I got some work to do them. Thanks!
Make sure you use the hyper express (on a different alt) , it's a very free 1445 (which will unlock stronghold honing buffs for all your alts)
you need brel relic before you can transfer into brel ancient iirc
Can't you still do HM G1-2 and NM G3-6 and transfer your Brel Relics to Ancient while you're working on getting the mats to finish your weapon? You get a new raid and Chaos Dungeon too (i think?) at 1540.
No you can't. You explicitly cannot skip armor sets. You'll need that piece to be upper relic first and then ancient.
No you cant but you can do the following:  -Do brel hard  -craft an ancient armor piece   -transfer a brel relic piece you have now to ancient  -dismantle the old transfered +0 brel relic piece  -use the 40 horns you just got by dismantling to craft the brel relic weapon (If you dont have enough you can repeat this with multiple pieces)
Directly no.    But if you have an other char that has got the full brel relic set achievement (Character > Items > "Phantom Shard Remnants"), you can use the transfer+decraft trick like others said.
No
Nope. But like how other people said, you can just do 1-2 nm grab ur remaining pieces for ur wep then swap over to hm.
Skip the week, you need to craft full Brel NM first.  You could theoretically hone to 1540, then do Brel HM g1-2 and NM g3-6. Assuming that's all you need for horns.  I'm personally doing HM g1-4, then NM g5-6 and that's enough horns for me for g1-6 week 2.
If you get your Artist to 1540, just do G1-2 HM Brel, the. Finish off your weapon with G3-4 NM Brel. Doing this way, you'd get mats for ancient gear and get 30 Horns to your weapon. If you want to, you could push to 1550 for week 2 and then do G1-4 on HM and G5-6 NM and get another 16 horns.   This would be 46 Horns in total, which would be 2 more horns then waiting another week doing NM Brel, in addition to getting Ancient Accessories and Ancient gear mats.
Yes same as before, you need full Lower Relic to get the achievement and be able to craft Upper Relic. They mentioned it in the notes this time as well :)  So unless they already unlocked the achievement with another character they will have to wait.
he indeed could do HM G1-G2 at 1540 to craft a ancient piece and get back 40 brel mat to craft his weapon.

Considering HM has a first clear chest it'd probably be more worth doing 1-2HM, craft ancient chest pieces and dismantle the nm brel piece to get back the 40 Phantom Horns - could then continue running more HM if high enough
You can do Brel HM G1-2, craft a ancient piece, transfer a Brel NM piece and then dismantle the Brel NM piece for 40 horns.
No, you have to have 6 piece brel before you can craft ancient. Says in patch notes
But the achievement isn't bound to character. So any other character will be enough?
Per announcement You can’t craft ancient until you’ve finished 6 piece Brel
I have 45 horns, even if I craft and dismantle I won't have 100 for the weapon.  I think the only people that can go HM g1-6 week 1 are the people who did NM g1-6 week 1.
You need the achievement on your account, not on the specific character.
Just wait on craft. He could still get the mats, which is the important part.
Yes, on the off chance the artist is their highest level character, if they never got the full set, they would still need to get the achievement. If it's an alt, they should be fine.
According to the announcement (unless I read it wrong) you need the achievement for having 6 Brel pieces which OP or anyone else could get on any other character. Then again I don't know if OP has the achievement, they should def check that l.
Read community guide, your gauge represents very little of the overall damage from CO, there is no way I'd drop Adrenaline for MS, in any CO build.  KBW won't be very efficient at that either of you run that.
MS is not optimal for CO summoner. Adrenaline gives you enough crit to make KBW valuable. The rest of your build is also not optimal. Barricade is good if you naturally have enough shield to make use of it, but you are using non-optimal skills just to utilize barricade. Reines protection is not even used in the build. Winged spirit is usually only used in a charming set build to help get more set procs. Jahia is also not the go-to identity skill. Ali marge or Akir are generally used. Although identity skill only accounts for like 3-5% of your total damage, so using the wrong identity is not a big deal.   Assuming you manage to keep shield up 100% of the time, barricade is giving you a 16% dmg boost. With typical hallu CO summoner levels of swiftness, you should be near cap for raid captain bonus of +18% after 10% yearning bonus. Even if you are not capped, you only need 35.5% move speed bonus to beat barricade (if 100% shield uptime). Let's be honest, no summoner is going to have 100% shield uptime, and to even get close to that, you are sacrificing a lot of damage. Not even sure what skill you are sacrificing to use reines protection, since winged spirit is the one swing skill slot we have, which you are already using (winged spirit, horses, or earth collapse).   Drop barricade for raid captain. Drop any MS for as much adrenaline as you can afford (ideally 3). Drop reines protection for whatever core skill you are missing. Swamp, water elemental, 4 pets, and ancient spear are all required to make the build function near peak performance. Dropping any of these for reines protection (a skill that adds zero DPS) is a major DPS loss for the build. 5 of those skills make up over 80% of your damage (4 pets + spear). The swamp/water elemental combo (with C/J) gives you enough mana to keep casting. Swamp alone also adds over 20% to your DPS. None of these should be dropped.  Here's a link to the summoner community guide which this info can be found:  [Summoner Community Guide - Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OePqvZocw3FYPphmUGQpzExeHPK1J7TBncij3w4cyHc/edit?usp=sharing)
Only MS1 is worth. You go MS 1 for the cheaper ancients cost + extra ancients effects. Also your crit is too low for a KBW build ATM so dropping Adrenaline is not the play.   Going 4x3+2 with the meta engravings honestly shouldn't have been that bad since for a smaller alt like yours you should go 50/50 crit swift and 100 quality 5/3 Crit pieces for the summoner build are like 1-5k
U use MS so the summons get buffs and cost less. Highest dmg for Co summoner is spear not even close is the akir. So I presume buffing main skill is more important.
Is this considering that you are running 4x3+2 or what is your total engravings here?  My current build is 4x3 +2(adrenaline), +1 (master summ)  Gives a little more utility, however I think in your case adren is pretty important if you are running kbw, otherwise might be a little bit of a dmg loss?  Need 60% crit for kbw to be 16% dmg increase I believe. Can get a crit synergy in party, but synergy usually not 100% uptime.  However I don’t think it will be the end of the world depends what your other engravings are.
The community guide explains it better. Don’t have the link I’m in holidays. Someone give him the guide
you 100% drop master summoner for adren 2 if u were to pick
I only run master summoner 1 for chaos dungeons so I can phoenix more often. Really speeds it up.
akir is like 7% of your damage on co  ms1 boosts that at MOST to 10%, which is not worth 5% crit and 2% damage across the board
is phoenix better when using charm? or still alimarge/akir?
Well doesn’t MS also buff main skill? Flat damage not Atk pwr and the crit is the same… plus it’s always whereas adrenaline needs to be maintained.
I should’ve added in first place. Just edited. Lmk your thoughts.
 [Summoner Community Guide - Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OePqvZocw3FYPphmUGQpzExeHPK1J7TBncij3w4cyHc/edit)
Phoenix probably since it multi hits unless you have master summoner
It buffs spirits only I think or maybe spear as well not sure or online to check. But for sure not the summons. And Co is summoner
It doesn't buff summons iirc which makes up half of your damage as a CO Summoner. I'd definitely have read the community guide before you theorycrafted your own build
Ima say it probably won't happen until they can reduce bots enough so they can make all the money.
I dont understand the hate, having it won’t affect the gameplay at all, I think it’s the ideia of having something in the game “we” can’t normally have, don’t get me wrong there’s no way in hell I could have one but I don’t understand why we should refuse it so those who could have it don’t. “How dare you having fun” same thing happened with yoz’s jar. Ps: just my 2centz
Bot farms will be very happy if the actually bring it into our version.
I want it to come so I get a chance at big gold lmao
Maybe a controversial opinion but I hope it makes it into the game. Its funding the servers with marginal DPS gain versus the real money cost. Also, makes it so non whales can hope to get a very lucrative drop from legion raids.
It would be PR hell if a weapon that costs a car came into our version
You mean rmt weapons? Nah we aren't getting those.
Hell no
I hope for AGS that they refuse to bring Esther Weapons into our version of the game. It‘s the most P2W feature LA has to offer and it‘s not even close comparing it to something else in terms of cost.
I hope not. This game have enough p2w features as it is we don't need another layer of it. The whales already have los 30 and full lvl 10 gems to stroke their epeen we don't need something that's quite literally unoptainable for anyone not buying gold from bots.     Seeing so many people openly defending p2w in this thread alone is just a daily reminder on why this industry is so shit now.
I will see that person which is dumb enough in the west to swipe for esther 😂
[removed]
There has not been any announcement on Esther weapons. I feel like it’s highly unlike we will hear anything about it for quite sometime, especially since they discussed legendary skins a while back and said they felt they were to costly/to rng for NA. If they think legendary skins are to much money then I can only imagine Esther weapons.
If they think legendary skins are too pay to win, I can't imagine them implementing esther weapons, at least not in the same way they are in Korea.
Esther weapon is just another p2w element of the game that already have a lot of ways to gain more power with swiping. But you also dont understand that it will affect f2p players: oreha prices will go up because life skill resources will be in high demand. If you like to farm thats no problem but if you despise life skills, you are fucked. Esther is also another reason to hone weapon to +25 (you need that for esther) so honing weapons will be more pricy too. So f2p can either sell red stones and  slow down their progress with +20/21 weapon or pay more to compete for resources with whales. No lifers will probably earn some gold but more casual players will be in bad spot for some time for sure
It's just more p2w and one of the more egregious p2w elements. The only people who actually like p2w are the whales wanting to flaunt their wealth.
Same, people seems to think that if something is in the game they'll need to have it, so if esther is in the game they'll need to have it. 90% of those people won't even try to get a single +25 so I don't get why they cry about something that won't impact them, apart from some ultra rare jackpot drop added to raid. Let the whales have fun if they want.  yoz jar is even different, because it's only relate to F4, so it's 100% P2W.  Technically a ultra try hard F2P (bus, playing with ah, lot of lucky expensive drops...) could get esther.  &#x200B;  Also I think if esther was coming, they would have talked about it in the previous news about talking about ancient gear. I can't see it coming as a suprise without announce.
Fuck that. There is enough pay to win Gamba as it is. Atleast lvl 25 weapon is achievable for a f2p overtime. An Esther weapon is not. It is a slippery slope implementing these features little by little. AGS has done well to keep out some of the bad KR features. We should continue supporting them doing so.
The main problem is that everybody can have Esther Weapon +2 but its not worth shit under +5-6 but +5-6 requires millions of gold. Thats the problem.  A F2P player or a semi hardcore player will never get this. It takes too much time and gold so they will be demotivated realllly fast after they calculate what requires for upgrade.  Quick Math: You need 48 material for +6 (I dont know its name, the main material) which cost 500-800k in Korea (now) for 1 piece. Lets say we will sell it easily for 500k for the whales. That requires 24 million gold JUST for this 1 type of material.  In Korea when Esther came in, this material costed 2.1 million gold. Just. One. Piece.
How are bots gona farm clown ?
BDO has no issues with that though. and stuff over there could easily cost > 1million USD
Please explain why it would it be an issue in our version?
So a 1590 whale with full lvl 10 gems, los 30, 5x3+1 and maxed qualities does double your dmg already and you don't ever play with him anyway. Then with esther  he does 2.3x your dmg instead and you still won't ever see him except in town. Whats the problem? The tradeoff is you having a chance to get rich from an esther essence on clown
Can I ask why people care soo much about others doing p2w on a pve game ? Lol. It would give f2p players more way of farming gold no ? Who cares if a guy has +8 Esther wep and 1 shots a boss in a pve game that doesn’t even Have any leaderboard chart or smth except for hell guardian and stuffs
Bracelet is the biggest p2w what are you saying

It got removed cuz  too many cried on forum without knowing their value even, they just say 10% costume ohh p2w / 30k ~ gold each piece on AH  omg unacceptable , bruh could buy 2 full sets almost every week but whatever. Some of legend skins were cheaper on ru server than actual skins but ppl just cryyyyy
[removed]
the giga whale is gonna do more damage than you either way (on paper), with or without esther weapons. but with esther weapons the non whales could at least profit off of the whales, which means its a win/win situation.   youd have to be pretty stupid to be against it tbh.
Bracelets say hello. They are bigger power spike than Esther wep at ancient bracelet.
>Technically a ultra try hard F2P (bus, playing with ah, lot of lucky expensive drops...) could get esther.  Do you realize how much gold is needed for +8 esther?  Everyone can have +2 esther, doesn't mean they can get +8 lol.  I don't give a fuck if we have esther or not but saying this shit is so  disingenuous.
I know some ultra tryhard players on RU that bus everything on all characters every week for god knows how long, they have around 10 million gold currently. And that's with busses holding higher prices for much longer (brel normal 1-4 sold for 30k quite far into brel hard release, when on EU it tanked below 10k almost right away.  Of course western version had insane opportunities with trading mats flipping because of bots, but even if you combine everything you won't get anywhere near ~100 mil required to make a +6 weapon, let alone ~200mil for +8 (just ballpark, I'm assuming esthers to be ~2 mil each).
Yoz's Jar isn't just F4. It is also the skin transmog system. Because people didn't want a 1% increase gamba box, we miss out on cool gamba skins AND transmog. And yet, people still wanna tap to 25....
You realize there's an NPC that allows you to get untradeable ones up to Esther +4-5 for free?
the need for the insane amount of gold to buy all the mats
It is not just esther essences. There are SH items that you can craft as well that you need a metric ton of fish and other life skill items in order to craft.
he'd be jealous
The West doesn‘t like obvious P2W features. Everything we have in the game right now is achievable for every player, through grinding and some RNG of course. Esther weapons will never be achievable for 99% of the playerbase. And the 1% that will actually get the esther weapons will fuel the Bot farms for an eternity.
yup i for one would prefer it get released so we can squeeze bot gold out with a lucky esther stone, also more incentive to do 56 surely is nice too
In Lost Ark everything is about setting and achieving your personal Goals, 1590, lvl 10 gems, LoS 30, 9/7 stone are all seperate goals you can actually work towards too and a lot of players already achieved them. But if you really want an Esther Weapon as your goal and don‘t have the financial wealth for it, it‘s unrealistic. The Problem with that jackpot drop in our version specifically is it‘s with great certainty Botted Gold, in KR at least you know someone swiped for that Gold and brought the blue crystal prices down for the average player.
Because theyre insecure, they care about what p2w can achieve versus working on what they can manage. Most people who complain are people who aren't even active enough in the game.
After Brel HM releases, people would happily accept juicers with +25 weapon and full lv10 gems to speed up their run. Those are also way out of reach to a majority of players for a very long time. Yet a sidereal weapon which is only slightly stronger than a +25 suddenly becomes unacceptable. Even though said system allows the average raider to potentially earn hundreds of thousands of gold from a lucky drop.
It is what it is. Everyone wants it week one, which means either expensive or crafting. FOMO will be the doom of western region
yeah dude, wrong address. spent couple hundred on skins and cards, spent time to grind my roster to 6 chars above 1540 so kindly STFU if your only argument is an insult. There is already plenty of systems that whale can use their money on that doesn't hurt f2p players. So go enjoy being a ret*** somewhere else or start thinking before typing
Nah, you'd have to be pretty stupid to want to increase the gap between normal players and whales even more just for the small chance at lottery tickets.  At the same time you'd be jacking up the costs of fusion materials for everyone.
Its pretty whack all around. Its a lottery ticket most wont get to cash in, and something too expensive to own...  Pretty simple to understand why someone may not want it in their game.
yes that's why  there's the word 'technically' in front. I know its billions of gold, but so that's why it doesn't match your "everyone"
and here i thought it isn't in our game because it would conflict with gambling laws... (in certain countries like NL/BE for example)
Honing a weapon has a progress bar. It is achievable on a main overtime. Fuck Gamba.
The skin system is already a transmog lol. You can equip any skin item and apply it or not if you prefer the defaut visual and equiped it just for the small stat  Yoz only bring the gamble box including the legendary skins with increase stat. The additional transmog system coming with yoz is only usefull if you have skins with different stat like legendary.
Yes you can buy bound mats by brel hard currency and you also have a chance for getting these mats from Kakul G3, Brel hard G6 and from the new Abyss Dungeon Kayangel.  You can do that. You need 28 essence for +5 (which is the usable level) I dont know how many currency will you get from brel hard but lets say, that you can buy 1 essence / week. It will take 7 month to get to +5 with bound mats for 1 character.  You need +5 minimum because +4 is only 1500 ilvl and +5 is 1600. So you need 28 mats to get to +5. (plus the other mats which will be really expensive too because nobody likes to do life skills in this game only the bots)  So if you think you can get a +5 in a logical amount of time then you are wrong and you dont know what are you talking about.  This weapon is not efficient in any way. This was made only for the whales, to dump gold.  If you are full level 10 gems, level 5 tripods, los 30 card set and you dont know what to do with your gold, then go for it. Otherwise this weapon is not worth 1 gold.
I'm going to be honest I am so happy to see people finally understanding the game and stop shouting about P2W legendary skins and Esther. Or perhaps all the idiots who did yell about it simply left
Aren‘t the only unbound ones you can get from clown?
What if you do want an Esther weapon and set it as your goal regardless if it’s feasibly achievable or not? To even start on it you’ll need a +25 ancient which the majority of players will never see or even get close to. The rates past + 20 are disgusting as is and it’s already unrealistic to go for a +25. Should they just not add +25 as an option because  players that have unrealistic financial wealth will hit it as soon as they can?
because 1% more damage matters when that person already runs full lvl 10s with 9/7s on their alts vs your 7/7 full lvl 7 gem alts that deal 25%+ less damage. the difference in damage is eaten by variance at that point.  but sure, if you got some inferiority complex then it sure looks like an issue.
I guess we shoudld ban every money game from the world then
How's it any different from +25 Ancient weapons which 99.99% of the playerbase will never achieve
Unless they are ripping people off on hell bus carries every single day for the rest of their lives, they are not getting esther 8 weapons. You said "technically" but then described a method that not only won't work, but is literally irrelevant unless they have 20 years to try. To suggest otherwise is to suggest that a single individual is capable of making **hundreds of thousands of dollars** on a solo account playing this game across a couple years.
Well, "technically" you will never be able to have billions of gold without hard swiping.
/rolleyes and here I thought it would be understood that it could be changed to not break the law and still allow us to have content.
You realize it's a choice if you want to gamba or not right? Those costumes can be bought from auction house.
Have you seen the progress bar for a 25 weapon? Lol. Just because you see the bar move, doesn't mean it's good. Hell, stones are gamba too. It's all around you and yet the "loot box" name pisses you off. That's just ignorance. They could have modified Yoz's Jar to be less "in your face" and give a stupid little progress pity bar.
Yoz's jar also comes with skin disassembly into cloth which can be used to either roll on more jars or *craft skins that look like old t1/t2 armor sets* (and others, like the wolf head from Rowen so you can get more than one), and the latter is what most people mean by transmog. They could theoretically release that part without leg skins, but they clearly don't care to, so a lot of people are mad about the whole deal.
No. Remember that cool T1 set piece or whatever.... Allowing the player to get that skin is part of Yoz's Jar. We are limited to the current ilvl set and whatever set they decide to give us. Yoz's Jar opens that up quite a bit.
My point stands that it doesn’t cost 24 million like your stupid calculations lol. Also, 7 months for an endgame weapon seems totally fair.
it drops from all final gates for bosses including and after clown so clown g3, brel g6, elgacia abyssal dungeon final gate, akkan g3 etc and probably that voldaik one too although i haven’t seen anyone get it from there yet being posted
No, it p2w of any form just makes the game worse for anybody who doesn't whale. Wanting there to be less doesn't require an inferiority complex. It just requires some semblance of a brain.
No one is getting +25 by lottery
We've seens tons of screenshot from people who stocked several hundred millions of fishes because they speculate when it was worth nothing, and now it's worth more than 3 gold per fish.  That's a single way from many for a F2P tryhard (not everyone, but I always said technically + overtryhard, so ofc I don't even think a single person actually did it) to own already close to a billion gold value.   Now you want a second way ? imagine that guy investing even his gold flipping mats for even 1% benefice, boom he get an other 10M.
Well, I know F2P players with 10mil+ gold on RU, but they intend to spend them on the normal gun, simply because its way more beneficial.
Of course its a choice. It doesnt mean I will support a change that adds more gamba to the game I enjoy. You give an inch, theyll take a mile.
You give an inch, theyll take a mile. Yeah they could have changed the systems. They can also just sell the skins too. Go ask them
I kinda don't want that cuz rip all the affordable skin pieces in the auction house.
It does cost 24 million if you buy everything. (I mean only the essence is 24 million (and I was optimistic), didnt talk about other materials and crafting cost so its more than 24 million)  7 month is not fair because this will be an endgame weapon from +6 and not on +5. So you need almost 10 month to get a +6.  When you will reach +6(1625) on Esther, others will reach +21 (1630) on the Akkan weapon which is stronger than your +6 and it doesnt cost that much. It will be far cheaper and faster than your Esther weapon.  Of course its your game. I dont really care how you play it and what will you do in the game. Its easy money if it will drop because whales and RMT players will pay everything for it.
you realize that this doesnt have any impact at all, right? if you want to make the game non p2w (complaining about p2w in a pve game is idiotic anyway, as all current successful MMOs incorporate p2w) they would have to completely redesign the whole game. fully. every single system.  so you are in essence complaining about something that has zero impact on you and reduces your chances of making gold. well done. you could just let the whales play and enjoy the bigger gold income.
Nobody gets Esther 8 by lottery either
Then fucking ignore it? Why does it matter if it’s in the game if it’s for whales. You’re typing all these words then saying you don’t care is comedy.
No, this would increase the gap between normal players and whales while increasing the prices of trade skill related consumables, such as fusion materials. All for an incredibly low chance of getting a big ticket item.  This isn't a win for non-whales, it's a loss in both directions.  Removing p2w that already exists would take some work. But you know what doesn't? Not adding more of it.
"cashing in a lotto ticket" was in reference to the rare people that will get esther stones as drops. They go for half a million gold each on KR. The whale part is obvious...  Esther weapon = too expensive to own, esther stones = lottery ticket...
honest question: why do you cry so much about what a person does with their money in a PvE game? do you get physically hurt when a whale runs around with full lvl 10 gems and a 9/7 stone? how does this impact you in any way, shape or form?  and higher prices for life skill mats also means people earn more from life skill mats... surprise...  and the incredible low chance is not as low as you might imagine, especially when running 6+ clowns a week. id likely get more esther stones than i get giant gold bars.
One of the reasons I dislike p2w in PvE games is because it warps the gameplay around the p2w and makes skill less important.  If you are bad, just swipe the credit card and power through it.  This is also why there is no content in the game that is both challenging and rewarding. Everything needs to be buyable with gold so that whales never feel inferior. Hell modes can't reward any power - just cosmetics.  Another reason is completionism. A non-whale player can never complete current content - there will always be some casino mechanic which is impossible to actually finish without dumping thousands of dollars into the game. Ability stones and quality are a good example of that.  A third reason is that in order for whaling to be officially supported in a game, the developers either need to spawn in resources for the whale, or find ways to transfer time from normal players to paying players. Lost Ark does both but it's mostly the latter. Blue crystals and pheons are essentially this. Whenever you spend pheons, you are essentially sending the whale you bought blue crystals from thousands of gold that you earned.  I don't think these are "crying". I think they're legitimate ways that p2w makes games worse.

The yearning set buff is just that much better that not having it is seen as trolling.
supports run yearning, it gives atk speed, ms and atk power iirc? (correct me if i'm wrong).  they do not run dominion - dominion gives cdr and a dmg buff upon awakening. if you need to awaken more then you take awakening - the engraving which is mandatory and bis on all supports. refer to the community guide if you need more help on your builds [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OlCBWkiQRt0odr6BoOotxTpzhDcoEAicv8vJdzJIViI/preview#](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OlCBWkiQRt0odr6BoOotxTpzhDcoEAicv8vJdzJIViI/preview#)
So technically your first thinking is good. Dominion is nice, more CD in your awakening, an other usage, and add extra cooldown buff to help your utime on buff/shield.  The thing is that even without it your uptime is already nearly full because of swiftness and gems (maybe not yet at your lvl), and also as said by the other, yearning exist, and its support potential is way superior to your single benefit from dominion.   You'll have an aura that bring damage which stack with your buffs, and also increase everybody moovespeed and attack speed. The moove speed is a great help for slow class, and some already fast class are playing raid captain to convert that extra moovement to damage. The attack speed also help everybody rotation feeling better. Once you get use to play with a yearning, you really feel it if you don't have a yearning player within (which is probably the why you get trashed). Oh and also yearning bring you a meter buff to help your support identity if that wasn't already enough.  Final note that yearning doesn't stack, so if for any reason you end with 2 support, 1 of you could probably swap to dominion, but anyway 2 supports are a bad idea in general.  But anyway at that level it's not that dramatic, with the new buff on relic mat drop you should get your 55 wings in few weeks and be able to swap to fix. Ignore those trashing people, you looks like a smart mokoko who want to learn from his mistake :)
Dominion is fine before you have 6 set Yearning.     If you can get 6 Yearning, only then would it be called trolling (even 4 set is debatable).     Since I couldn't craft some yearning pieces I went for 2pc dominion/4pc yearning until I could.
yearning is better for support you dont run dominion unless you got dps artist
Unbelievable, Argos probably took 12 minutes instead of 11 because of you, you monster.
Play what you want. I have 2 set Dominion too. People are too stupid to realize the 10% dmg is additive while bard buff are multiplicative
Dominion is good if you doing chaos dungeons and dont want to run betrayal but in raid content, yearning is on another level. You give 10% movement / attack speed and 10% additional damage to all your party members with 100% uptime. Also you generate 16%-18% more identity gauge so your heals and dmg buffs have increased uptime.  There are classes like wardancer eso with lazenith / sorc igniter / mayhem zerker and others that need a class in their party that provides them attack speed to let them do a full burst rotation. Without attack speed buff those classes are losing a lot of potential damage.   Also 90% of the classes that run raid captain are sitting ln 130-131% movement speed so they need also the movement speed bonus to get an additional 4.5% multiplicative damage boost
The only reason to run dominion is if you spent multiple weeks clearing valtan before vykas and you have more relic armors than yearning pieces you can craft, like 4 valtan armors but only 2 vykas pieces since yearning is a 4 pc vykas wings armor set.   So some dominion pieces would be a "stopgap" meant to be replaced with yearning.
Yearning is the only set you will want to use in raid content where you are a support. I don’t mean to sound rude but if you don’t you are basically trolling your whole raid.
I highly suggest looking up build guides for your char. If you didn't know to use yearning then I worry about your stat distribution, engravings, skills and tripods. Artist has 6 mandatory skills and 2 flex only.
I'm more surprised he said 'Another' since I've never seen a sup use dom. lol
The only Raid that lasts long enough that you need an extra charge of awakening is brel g6.  That said, an extra awakening isn't really game changing.   Whereas yearning is basically 40% of your usefulness as a support if you are an absolute god at support. If you are average or even bad, yearning is life 80% of your contribution.
Don't care about them. My friend plays Dominion build just because he plays his Artist as a DPS. I mean, I am his pocket support afterall so I clearly do not mind.
Yeah ok, ill look into getting it then. Thanks
Thank you this is very helpful! I just got back to lost ark after a long break and my 1460 artist is my highest item lvl char. I'm learning alot in a very short time and doing so in front of people with way more hours than me so I feel like I'm ruining the game for other sometimes just cuz there is things I don't know (and some of it I don't know how I would ever learn without just trying). Tbh I have been bussing raids twice now just cuz I'm scared to try and fail. I watch videos, I read guides but I guess I can miss some stuff. I don't know a lot of the language used in raid lobbies so I have to do a lot of guesswork. Thanks for the help, I'll try to manage T.T
Hahaha yeah. I have now learned that not choosing Yearning is almost like trolling but I genuinely had no clue.
A 100% uptime additional source of damage increase is just straight up better than slightly higher uptime on bard buffs, even if the buff is weaker. It might be an option if you have no gems and are terrible at cycling between heavenly and sonic vibe, or maybe for spec bard (im not 100% sure because I’ll be honest I didn’t do the math for an edge case like this), but any well-geared bard just does not benefit that much since their attack buff uptime should already be high.
IGN amd Server so we can avoid you. Cant believe theres still Dominion trolls coming Brel Hard.
Ye that's basically my situation. I have only done Vykas once and that was today, so I had a couple dominion pieces just cuz i wanted a relic set bonus. I didn't know Yearning was the only valid one, but I didn't have the mats to make anything else so yeah haha. I just love the fact that someone went in on my profile to shit on me on an Argos gold run. I couldn't make anything else yet.
yeah I was told. I hadn't done Vykas yet tho and it was just an Argos gold run. Dominion was the only one i could get at the time and i did not wet a full set either. He went in and looked at my gear in an argos run just to tell me that. And not being like u should run Yearning just being an ass. Idk I just wanted a set bonus and use the mats I got from Valtan. I have only done Vykas once (and that was today) so have two yearning pieces now. People are so toxic in this game sometimes aha.
idk, im just figuring things out aha
Ye I have heard it a couple times by now (no flame). I didn't have mats for yearning and at the time I just took the one I could craft
Remember that once you have collected 55 Demon Bones (Valtan) and 55 Wings (Vykas) you can just use gear set conversion to swap relic sets whenever you want. It doesn't cost them, you just have to have obtained 55 of each overall.
oh it's just cuz i hadn't done vykas yet so i didn't have the mats. Thats the only reason i got the dominion set, it was the only mats i had so i just went for it. I remember now
If you are NA east, check out the Loot Heroes discord. It's a discord that focuses on teaching new players raids. Link is naelootheroes. Shouldn't have to worry about trying them out there.
i highly suggest joining a guild that is friendly and willing to help you because generally pugs (players in public lobbies) are impatient as these raids are just like "homework" to them and they just wanna get it all over and done with quickly.   it's pretty sad since being unwelcoming to newer players will eventually stunt the community's growth but there's not much you can do about it. i suggest joining the community discord (should be along the side bar of the reddit) and joining the channels for your classes as well as checking out the guides (usually in pins or in the link i gave u). if you ask people and explain that you are new they'll generally be more forthcoming but a lot of people just cannot fathom that a new player is in their lobby and isn't 100% familiar with the game's aspects and so they can come across very impatient and rude. i hope you have a better time in your lobbies in the future!
It's just too bad there are so many rude people in the game. They could have asked you about it and let you know without flaming.
Your inclination was good.  Unfortunately, yearning is very overpowered and very boring
NAE-Milande. Now what's ur IGN so I can make sure I don't party with your sorry ass
People actually did what you did back in the day after Valtan was released in the game but before we had Vykas, supports would run 2 piece dom because it's the next best thing when full Yearning is not yet available. So don't feel bad about your thinking.   Of course these days you hone fast and aim for endgame relic setup without bothering to optimize in the middle, like people don't craft Valtan/Vykas legendary DPS set (Demon Beast) or even proper Argos 5-piece set anymore.
Yea, dominion is the stop gap set. So long as you craft yearning first and then your remaining pieces are dominion so u can swap to yearning, its fine.
I appreciate the heads up tho
but will i be refused lobbies if i dont have the set? should I try to get it anyway? I only have three dominion pieces and not the full set, was all the Valtan mats i had  I cane back to lost ark after a long break and 1460 is my highest char. There is a lot of stuff I don't know but i'm trying to keep up. People get rlly mad at you for not knowing stuff but idk how im supposed to know without trying
>Thanks, I'll def check it out. I've wanted to try out Valtan and Vykas cuz it seems like a lot of fun actually doing the raids, even if it's hard. Nice to see that some people are way more understanding towards newer or returning players.
This. It's already stunting it unfortunately.  I came from other mmos that have a completely different tolerance level for this kind of attitude towards someone who doesn't know better and is open to learning. In my other mmo, if someone said that kind of comment to a new player, they would have found themselves without a group 5 secs later after some verbal warnings. If multiple different people submitted screenshots of one problematic individual griefing or ruining the experience of other players? That's one or even more weeks of suspension, depending on the severity. Up to a permaban. Players who cannot be respectful towards others are not needed in the game.   If LoA treated toxicity the same way it treats bots, this game might garner a healthier community. Who knows? Maybe. It is F2P after all. No barrier to entry means anyone can play. This includes people who need anger management, have low emotional IQ, poor self-esteem, or poor emotional regulation skills, and lack of self-awareness. Combine that to the grind and weekly hw checklist simulator that is this mmo, and you meet people exactly like the guy OP ran into.  AGS is committed to fighting bots, which is well and good. But I've never seen them issue even a public PSA to the community to treat each other with respect. Unfortunately they don't care unless it impacts how much money ends up in their pockets.
This is going to get downvoted but that's pretty much what separates LoA from other mmo communities. Unfortunately.   If you go to r/ffxiv's sub, search for posts by new players, and read the comments on those threads, you'll see a contrast in the overall attitude of the playerbase towards players who don't know everything yet.
Yeah. Also I remembered that the only reason I have dominion is cuz I didn't do Vykas til today, so I didn't have mats for anything else. I got two pieces now, people just shit on you before even considering you are in a different situation than themselves. I get that people could get mad if you ran full dominion in a legion raid but it was a argos gold run, and I did not have a full set. But I appreciate the heads up, I'll work on a full set of yearning
nahh nice bait with the fake name though. my ign is euc-domonsuppistroll :)) poor you, probably 1 year of playing yet you dont know Y6 perma buff will always and forever will be better than y4/d2 :)))()()))))))
You won't get refused since noone actually checks it and expects the support to have it. So people will be suprised and mad that it is not yearning.   All players build and play based on having yearning. It is just straight up the best set.  Sometimes when going 4 man content with friends without a sup we even semi-jokingly say that the weakest dps should equip yearning.
Hope to see you! You'll find me there as Silent.
I mean, having a toxic community does affect sales. It literally drives away players who would have otherwise stayed. That's potential sales down the drain for them.
For what it's worth I think you meant to say "that's what separates FFXIV from other MMO communities" because FF is the only MMO community I've seen that doesn't flame people misplays and stupid builds.
Were you running Yearning 2 + Dom 3? You can build 2 pieces of Yearning from Valtan pieces but I haven't seen any post of yours claiming you were wearing  2pc yearning which you can get without running Vykas. Party buffs aren't available until 4pc but if you're only wearing Dom and 0 yearning then I doubt anybody would even consider whatever you think your situation. If you had 2pc yearning your situation should have been 2 yearning + some Dom and you saying "sorry I can't make 4pc until I clear Vykas" should have pretty much ended the Convo.
Ppl will notice in raid however if you don't have dominion. Spec classes know when they have no movement speed buffs and their attacks are slower.
Oh man I didn't see NAE, I'm EUC sadge
You're right about that. I mean that they are blind to the potential sales because they only seem to see the short term profits over long term investments. I found a very interesting comment by someone who brought up how LoAs model will never cause growth of new players. Going to find it. Edit: [found it](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/123u4h2/why_did_lost_ark_fail_to_maintain_a_very_large/jdwfrr6?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3).
You're not wrong at all because I've def heard positive things about ffxiv's community. But before LoA, I played another mmo (I'd rather not name it because I know what kind of unhappy ppl lurk in this sub and I'd rather all the toxicity and negativity stay here and not leak into my other mmos space).  That other mmo has a very casual friendly community as well. Now, granted, there's a distinction between the endgame community and casual community. Endgame community ppl like OP will get denied because minmaxing is required to clear certain raid mechs, but the casual community would welcome and encourage Op to play their own way. Its for that reason that I said mmo, not only Ffxiv.
I just didnt know and didnt have any other mats so i just made dom, that was all
Yeah they will notice, but that is after getting accepted into a group and the raid starting. At that point most groups will just deal with it if the raid is smooth enough just to lose less time by quiting and finding someone else. So it wont get you gatekept, but it will get you flamed
Yeah but sadly in most MMOs once you're doing midtier raids (and 1460 would be mid tier raid ilvl IMO) and you got a scuffed as fuck build the people who respond to you or the people you end up surrounded with are the end game community and not the casuals who are still hanging in whatever hub everyone afks to emote in.  Once you hit the raiding scene even at the entry-mid raids my personal experience is that the community just turns rabid...and this game specifically is mostly raiding which is why some people feel like it's so toxic.
Yeah I'm not going to shit on you for not knowing but having partial relic and no yearning just means you were 'choosing not to run yearning' whether that was because you planned to go DPS artist or because you're a newbie who doesn't know it's a bit more than just not being *able* to run yearning bc no Vykas. You'll get your yearning 6pc soon so don't sweat over it, but definitely expect some weird looks until you get at least 4 pc.
Haha true, I had one Vykas hard run back before artist when supports were insta-accepted without questioning, this one bard was running some sort of dominion/nightmare combo which I thought must have been some weird chaos dungeon setup and surely they will switch to Yearning so I accepted them anyway. Well turns out that was their main build, everybody was mad discovering this in the middle of the run but it was faster to just keep going and clear than remake.  After that incident I stopped blindly trusting supports and accepting when they apply in their chaos builds.
Since you never even made it to Tier3, use this opportunity and the story express + punika pass they are giving us now to reroll on an EUC server and get 2 characters almost instantly to Tier3. EUW region is dead.  Tier 1 and 2 chaos gate and such are going to be empty regardless, even on EUC, since 99% of the player base is in Tier3.
early game is dead in every region.
If you are 810 or <1445, start new in new region
Use story express to make a new character on another region. You'll get faster to T3 and you don't have to play on a dead server.
You can create a new character and get higher than 810 very quickly, I would recommend you to select EUC. EUW is dead
Euw isn’t dead, T1 and T2 content is dead.   Best choice would likely be to start on Euc and use the story express you got. And use the free powerpass and then play a few days to see which character you like more and then use the express event on that character.  Don’t ever expect players in T1/2 content tho. You will be blasting through those tiers if you choose to create more alts.
After server mergers and Artist release EUW endgame seems fine. "Dead" is certainly an exaggeration. But sure, better to start on EUC.
is that event available to all players? and does have time limit
I've played on EUW for about 3 months from release before deciding to re-roll on EUC. While the server merges might have made the servers themselves feel more "alive" the entire region is a ghost town compared to EUC. It was a huge difference in the number of groups in party finder and the availability of items on the market back when i re-rolled, and since then i doubt things changed for the better.
Story express is available to everyone. I believe it lasts until June. Once you get your designated story express character through punika (the first T3 quest zone) you’ll also get a punika power pass that lets you instantly boost another character to t3 as well
Would like to add that in order to receive your punika's pass you need to do the purple quest called "berver's friend" in punika. Around 1 hour to finish it but don't be surprised if once you've done punika's story you aren't gifted the pass on the spot.
I don't mind having the AH restrictions (purchase time limit, daily sale limit) as they effectively dealt with the major lag issue caused by AH scripters. BUT they really need to scale these restrictions (or any kind of bot/script related restrictions) to ilvl. There is no reason that someone with 1500+ characters is getting the same treatment as 1370 bots.
10sec rule is not bad compared to the fact you cant buy from more than 7 different seller at once; making buying stack of 999 difficult.
Needs to scale with roster. Lift more restrictions. I’m 200 plus roster and 7 1520-1510+ characters. I shouldn’t be in the AH gulag like a fresh account.
There's two things that I would like to see changed really:  1) Change the 20 listings per day limit to something like rosterlevel/5 or rosterlevel/4. That would punish bots and increases the listing limit of actual players  2) Increase or remove the cap of only being able to buy from 7 different sellers at the same time. This would make it easier to buy bigger stacks of crafting or honing material. I also feel that this would make it so that you don't encounter the 10 second AH cooldown as often.
Why dont bring up to like 30 actions per 3-5 minutes? Keeps legit players at normal rates and scripters are still blocked.
It also imposes this restriction when you don't succeed in buying anything.  Not to mention checking your purchase history is a straight up lie.
This is whatever but the 20 sale limit has to go with this next update or our accessory prices are gonna be messed up.
You remove the 10 second limit and your AH stops functioning.  We're already starting to get errors from it again with it
Same bro….
i think this 10 sec rule is what keeps the ah from breaking
unfortunately, there is 100 post like this, and i dont think SG/AGS gives a tiny lil bit of f\*\*\* about our opinion.
It's time to remove all AH restrictions, all item trade limits, and pheons as a concept.
I don't really mind it, it's the only reason real people can buy something that is posted for way below the market price.  Market botting is very obvious even with this restriction, I don't wanna think about how it works without this restriction.
You really don't want that.
fr fr let me play the game bro
You whine about everything. Pick a stance and stick with it. Like it’s really killing you to spend an extra 10 seconds to lost something. I’ll take the 10 seconds over not controlled economy and more bots.
I agree but you should post on the forums if you want ags to see this
This community approved such changes at time when they were released and criticism against it were downvoted as unreasonable hate against ags/sg, you get what you deserve.
You expect too much as a west player
 >it's so annoying and such a waste of time  Then don't do it. Woulda saved you the time posting this too.
Nope, it's needed to deal with AH scripts but they should tweak it so that the cooldown is random between 5 and 10 seconds and also limit the amount of purchases in a given timeframe until a certain item level has been reached.  I don't mind removing the whole thing for those at 1490+
I agree with this response Until I tried to buy fish. Let me buy bigger bundles please
you're so far out of your element it's embarrassing, in no world will AH scripting lag the server in any way that would effect your performance  you literally have no idea what you're talking about, and it's just so reddit that your comment got upvoted over 100 times  ignorance supporting ignorance
People with multiple 1500+ can start to rmt  But i agree some kind if trust status should be implemented
The buy delay sucks but I'm fine with it..the listing limit is annoying though...there has to be a way to slowly allow more lists. Someone posted about more being unlocked based off roster level which I like.
God is that what it was?  That's driving me crazy when I need to buy something in bulk, buy 7 at a time,  Wait 10 seconds and buy another set...
this this this this THIS!   Roster level scaling when it comes to the AH. my roster lvl 240, 12 characters at 1415+ homie STILL complains about the AH restrictions a year later.
They already are …
Then maybe they fix that problem as well.
Just gotta disable listings of level 1-2 or even level 3 gems and the AH is fine without any restrictions like the 10s rule or 20 listing limits.
 It broke constantly with the 10s rule & the 20 limit both in place.  These are not real solutions. They need to add proper rate limiting & detection of abuse.
It works better without it these restriction dont stop the bots cause they just use more than 1  the reason the AH is not bogged down right now is because the people with the bots started combining there gems notice there are more 5,6,7's 5hen ever before its also why gem prices deflated not because of frog like everyone seems to think
No, i really **do** want that.
i dont see how the 10 seconds hurts bots. they just use a script that makes them buy things every 10 seconds and thats it.
Alot of us have they just ignore us they only hear the people that agree with them and ignore everyone else or shut thread down and delete it
The hell we did
I expect honesty and respect, they cant even be bothered to do that
Stupid ass response
Yeah its hella annoying maxing out the buy order and you only get 10 fish like.. bruh.
Even if bundle amounts doesn't change, dude at least let me buy the specified amount, instead of a partial purchase for god knows what reason
Ok, so, then why don't you explain it to us, master of lost ark code?  Explain why the auction house lag effectively disappeared when they implemented those changes, but *not* because of the changes.
🤓
??? that's one of the dumbest comment i have ever seen in 2023
What the flying fuck do you think people RMT by buying 10 bundles of fish in a row or what
They already do rmt  Wats ur point?
I was trying to buy solars to push +20 and put in a stack of 250. Got 20. 🤡
They did. They limited the number of interactions with the database that requires writing to 1 every 10 seconds per account.  I agree they could likely lower it to like 5 seconds and it would significantly improve the experience for regular players, but still limit the number of maximum updates at a time.  Just like the 20 listing limit wouldn't be nearly as hurtful to regular players if it were slightly higher.
Then you'll effectively lose access to the AH. The addition of this hold down timer was to stop the market being unusable due to bots.
They don't care what we think
It took so long to get Solar Carps this morning. Appears they are being listed by a few stacks at a time, so each buy is only yielding around 16-20 stacks. Painful and unnecessary
i had to stock up on rocks and wood a while ago and it was so bad to constantly get 50 instead of whatever the max is lmao
It's because you can only buy from max 7 sellers at a time. If multiple people are only putting up small amounts of fish to sell, you only get part of your order filled. It's a stupid system.
Exactly as you said. Changes. Not just one change. You only know about one change. The one that's apparent. You don't know what else they did. KRs auction house is 100 times bigger than ours. LITERALLY. How come they don't lag?
You have to rmt to have more than 1 character 1500+?
Yep so that means 7 people/bots listed a total of 20 solars and that's the batch it gave you. Scaling restrictions to over 1500 ilvl players would make a lot of sense
and thats exactly what we schould be asking for
A timed delayed (ie. the 10s limit) is not the same as proper rate limiting. As far as anyone can tell, they have not implemented proper rate limiting on the auction house.
You know what would help that? Deal with the bots. If someone is putting in dozens of requests in a second put them on a cooldown timer. Or, better yet, get better bot detection. Why the fuck am I left to suffer because these devs are useless?
That's a dumb bandaid fix.  The ah got fucked because of tens of thousands of pages of level 1 gems.
It's the amount of transactions, not size.
I never implied that?  The person im replying to is implying that people would start to rmt if they removed the restriction. If they wanted to rmt then they would have already rmted  Actually no idea why im getting downvoted, but thats reddit for u
They haven't.  We've still seen errors on the auction house even with the 10s limits in place.
The AH got fucked because bots used the AH to transfer resources and gold, like gems. As well as to mass post. This was all done through scripting at large volume. If you want to remove the safeguards that would halt refresh timers so the rest of us could use the AH, that just shows a lack of forethought based on prior evidence.
Someone know how many bots kr has? That's probably the answer.
Because you can't fucking read.  The comment you replied didn't say **any** person would RMT. They specifically said "People with multiple 1500+"
Why doesn't kr see the same issue it's fixable they are just lazy.
Once again, it's an easy band aid to a solution that would impact real players way less than the current implementation.  Make lv1-2 or even 3 gems unlistable and call it a day.  Ah usage has been lowered lot with the other restrictions as well.  Time to lift restrictions that at this point only fuck over the real players.  If you're so keen to keep it, put it behind a roster level or highest reached ilvl - lift the annoyance for roster 100+ for example.  You're ridiculous with your compliance.
You misunderstand it does not work  not ever it only cripples players u still cannot get good prices or very easily get a good deal on a BIs cause there gone faster  than u can hit refresh
>People with multiple 1500+ **can start** to rmt  Who's the one who cant read?
Likely because KR doesn't have a massive bot problem that causes much more traffic on the AH.  The bots farm gems and the gem buyers spam the AH trying to snipe them cheap.  This creates a lot of extra traffic.
'Compliance'. Ok pal. The 10 second hold down must really be hurting your 'freedom'. Good luck out there.
??? This makes no sense. Are you volume buying accessories? The hold down timer happens after a purchase. So to have this be a problem, you must be multi-buying accessories. This restriction prevents bot scanners from instaflipping every accessory that is BiS for double price when they show up at a discount.
Wow has more bots than this game their AH is fine its fixable they are just lazy admit the devs don't care about us.
They already restricted ilvl for gem selling. They could also make it so that you can only sell 5lvl or higher, then there will be much less transactions. As a bonus maybe some bots will get a ban before they manage to farm 5lvl gem.
[removed]
So they just combine them up before selling them.  And the ilvl restrictions were working great for about two weeks until they gave out a free express pass and selling the raid gear on the AH that allowed the bots to just bypass those restrictions.  For real the market was clean for a couple weeks

Yeah, giving out the argos gear basically means that we won't be save from bots before ah gets limited to > 1490 and brel gear lol.    Maybe if they check for the full relic set achievement but that would mean new players have to clear vykas/valtan 2-3 times before beeing able to access the ah :/
It would reduce load on the servers handling market/AH, so they could remove some other restrictions that were placed for this purpose (like that 10s timeout). It is also harder to make a profit by buying 5lvl gems, merging them and selling so less scripts creating load on that service.
[Skill / Battle / Character]  * Paladin changes for Elixir (feature we don't have yet and I don't understand enough to translated)   * Striker 'Storm Dragon Kick' being treated as Fire damage has been adjusted.      * Above skill does not deal elemental damage.   * Reaper 'Nightmare' arrival point has been adjusted as below if the location is a drowning or fall death area.      * Current: Front of the target.     * After: On top of the target.        * If it is not possible to stack with the target, you will instead move to the front **__as it did before__**.   --TL Comment--   So according to the Reaper notes, I guess I am exploiting a bug huh Smilegate? It definitely does not land me in the front when there is no space between the wall and the boss in global build, and the as it did before bit implies this behavior is an exploit.  -Edits for formatting.  -Edit2 context on comment
Still no reaper buff. Ok
Anything in here about sharpshooter,deadeye or striker
I can confirm that nightmare does put you in front if there's no space in global. I run clown every week and gate 2 is the biggest offender. Couple of friends/guildies also report the same issue since the artist patch dropped.
Lazenith Umar viable on striker now?
No, instead they imply we are using an exploit rather than admitting Nightmare is coded screwy. There is also allegations of Nightmare dagger throw hit being inconsistent from the front for Counter ruling.    Pausing my Reaper honing at 1445 and monitoring Inven for signs of hope similar to Summoner and Berserker receiving upgrades with new advanced class release within the group, but KR Reapers are dying.
I should probably translate the snippet itself the next time lol, one of my comments has the translation which was for Paladin, Striker and Reaper. For Striker, "Storm Dragon Kick" does not deal elemental damage anymore.
Hmmm... KR is discovering this just now, while we had this for a few weeks already then?
I still dont understand the problem "exploit "
It is already a BiS according to Korean guides to a point where some Deathblow Strikers tried to "dip out" doing mechanics to avoid triggering 3UF-LAZÉ bonus effect and got called out. On the other hand, veteran Strikers are of the opinion that you do plenty of damage from back attack bonus alone even if Lazenith effect wasn't micromanaged at the expense of failing fight mechanics.  Edit: run-on fixed.
Storm dragon is mobility skill, not esoteric
Viable..it's BiS and does crazy damage
Always has been
I still want a damage buffbut seeing they dont wanna, i will drop my 1500 reaper lol. Rip investment
Hmm i didnt know it did
Yeah, I'm not sure how Smilegate implements the builds but it is something that exists right now in global.
KR has had this in their same patch that Lunar has gotten their atk spd on Red Skills. It's been a thing for quite a while in KR now.
i have tested it.  you do basically around between 18 and 30 card set from light of salvation just with backattack alone.  and dmg skyrocket with lazenuts, but i find stupid to avoid mechs for saving it.  either you doing mechs slower or failing it, resulting in more time wich is the main reasson why more dmg seems optimal.  bc if not, just go full salvation, get dark resistance and good dmg increase and forgot about it.
I am concerned more about reapers being shit on by Smilegate again including the January balance patch (which Global is now under) having rolled back a 4.4% damage buff to Swoop skills during one week of testing.    There is a recording in Inven that shows it now needs exactly your model size or more to teleport you across with Nightmare, using Kuku-Sayton clown add. Currently, you "squeeze" as much as possible on the opposite side. With this information, the footnote now reads to me that Nightmare mobility usage to squeeze behind a target that backed into a wall is "an exploit".
[removed]
Korean Reaper community is in better health than Soulfist though. At least Reapers can agree they need something done about the class. Soulfists are busy arguing amongst themselves between "this class doesn't f-ing work" and "nahbru we good we plenty op in 20s dps cycle (that nobody else cares about)".    The 20s DPS cycle chart addendum was made on behalf of a Soulfist forum user and there is a debate about "who the f cares when longest dps buff from Bard is 15s and no other class has 20s rotation"
bruh if youre planning on dropping then drop ahead. Tf u play a character for if yorue not having fun? Reaper although not as good as other characters is still decent. I mvp often in legions guardians with similar ilvl in my group. This seems like a skill issue.
For something that's been a thing since January, these experiment posts expressing anger seem to be coming out late. What got me looking for the patch note snip that I posted WAS the complaint post made on the day of this patch.
If *I* work on my Striker, it's going to be whatever set I complete first lol. Galatur keeps avoiding me after the first copy.
There's relatively recent stigma against strikers in KR exactly because of it. There are so many gif of Umar lazenith strikers standing still while everyone else is staggering/countering/killing mobs because they are saving lazenith.
yeah sure, dark axeling in the same situation should be a bug too.   Wtf Smg, don't fuck with my reaper mobility.

They got the same QOL pass as everyone else taking away ready attack tripods and buffing damage but they rioted. SG probably going to ignore SF as long as they can now.
Hurr durrr skill issuee hurr durr. Of course im gonna drop it. They overnerfed the shit out of reaper. You have to be at 99% just to keep up with a deadeye. Just accept reality. Reaper needs a buff  Fyi i am having fun. Its just not fun playing at peak performance with minimal returns
It is especially on reaper always a skill-issue :-) cleared prokel trixion today with darks and atropine in 1:32 (my reaper is juiced), in raid with thirain, should be easy under a minute. But yea, reaper is weak 😂
That's what I said until I was getting close to finishing los 30... bastard is summoning mad crazy now
I just opened my first copy last week outside the free one. Got it after spending like 50k on the maris packs when chasing my last LOS card
tiny relevent story?:  I was in a 1500+ hvykas group, and when we entered the 2nd trash mob area, a striker said he can't hit trash mobs otherwise it'll trigger his card effect so he just stood there. I laughed a bit and i understood he had umar+lazenith but at the same time i didn't think it was a big deal to keep it off cd. A few confused emotes came out, I didn't say anything.**😂** Maybe he was flexing and or trolling.
Probably doesn't help that Striker's counter attack ties into opening rotation, although it does seem to be a fast cooldown. There are also Deathblow strikers trying to land more counters to try improving the class public image.
There are i1600+ Korean Reapers giving up the ghost on this fight and starting over on a different class. Will follow up periodically to see what the next patch cycle brings, but it looks like Reaper is "the joke" class to be compared against in current KR contents (that we will eventually receive).  Dark Axel jumping over being left alone is being countered by "jUsT uSe dIsToRtIoN bRo"

HURRR DURRRRR SKILL ISSUE  Nah but fr i see waht your saying, it just breaks my heart that you would drop a 1500ilvl character bc it needs a buff. Think of the amount of hours u put in m8 :( dont let it go to waste. reaper will get buffed eventually.....
what is the next brel weapon glow? +22 or +23?
1445 gunslinger atm, did valtan once and crafted 2 parts of the relic set. I would like to hone closer to 1475, can I just hone to +20 those four legendary parts of my set, and later transfer to valtan gear, or do I lose anything by not waiting for full valtan gear to hone beyond +17?   Thanks in advance!

It has ~500 leapstones    My main, reaper, is at 1460 with ~900 leapstones and a 5x3 (5x3+1 if i can find an accessory i need).    I enjoy both of them, but a little stuck on which one i should upgrade. I know people don't usually accept on ilvl characters for clown raid so i'm wondering if i should upgrade reaper since the engravings look better or arcanist because it's closer to 1475

Also I want the elemental backatk set for striker/wd so I need beatrice and galataur(need 3 of each) is it still worth it or no I should just wait until I get rank 9?

I've been hearing how rough it's been trying to get into groups if you don't reach a certain criteria (i.e the desired item level, proper class to play). I really enjoy the content but truthfully it does sound worrisome if there's extreme difficulty for even trying to join a group for endgame content.

He has a harder time than my Tai, Surge or Igniter to get parties (Ilvl 1530, level full 7 gems, quality 75 weapon).  It may be a stupid question but I'm curious. I'm 4 spender, 5M dps in trixion.
Anyone know if the update increases una leap/shard gain.
Just downloaded the game.  I am sure this is standard newbie question, but what are good starting classes. Picked Demon assassin and seems pretty fun.
Can you not chop trees and gather ores and such at your stronghold anymore?  I haven't played in a long time but I remember you could do gathering inside the strong hold but now I can't seem to find it.  Has it been replaced with the farming system?  I need regular Timber to level up stuff.
+22  +22 and +23 share the same glow.
Based on this:  https://www.reddit.com/r/lostarkgame/comments/wsc8yz/all_weapon_glows_for_sorc_upwards_to_esther_8/  +23, +24, +25
You lose nothing, go ahead. Only difference between legendary vs lower relic armor is a minor stat difference + legendary gear can only be honed to +20, relic gear can be honed to +25.
g1-6 NM = 8.5k, HM = 10.5k iirc. g1-2 gives like half the gold of 1-6, as usual. Just do g1-2 hm and 3-6nm and you'll be fine.
Assuming you're buying boxes, it's only 500 gold more than normal from what I've read. The gold that you get goes up, however, so do chest costs.
Yes.
Check Maxroll's honing calculator.   https://maxroll.gg/lost-ark/upgrade-calculator  It generally depends on a) whether you're full buying mats or if you have bound stuff and b) current market prices.   You should probably buy the relic honing books. You probably won't buy honing support mats for armor, that's usually wasteful. It may be worthwhile to juice weapon taps though.
1580 aka with Akkan update.
With that stone and engraving book, you pretty much have only one option:  Awakening - +3 and +4 (or +5) accessories  VPH - 2 +5 accessories  Blessed Aura - +3 accessory  Expert - +3 accessory  Magick Stream - +3 and 2 +5s (or +4 and +5) accessories  First, I recommend searching for a class engraving accessory first. There will be very limited options for those so it's best to build around that piece.   Awakening/VPH/Expert combinations are kinda around the same prices last I checked. So check the market and see which are the cheapest.  Magick stream accessories are much cheaper. So I recommend getting it on the necklace at least.
Relics:  Non accessories:  * BA book: 12 * Expert book: 12 * Awakening (stone): 8 * VPH (stone): 5  Accessories (prices based on EUC):  * 4 Awakening (12) + 3 Expert (15) / 1K for 90Q * 4 MS (4) + 3 BA (15) / 200 gold currently for 75Q ring * 5 VPH (10) + 3 MS (7) / 2K * 5 VPH (15) + 3 MS (10) / 2K * 5 MS (15) + 3 Awakening (15) / 15K Necklace  Net cost = 20k, swiftness around 1775 with bracelet.   That said, this relies on finding a cheap necklace and a 4 MS 3 BA piece at reasonable prices. This gives you two +4/+3 pieces, and the only 5s that you need are MS. MS should in theory be cheaper, as only 5×3 Paladin uses it. The 4 MS and 3 BA piece might be semi rare, as quite a few people have MS on auto dismantle if they don't dismantle by stats.  Some stuff could be moved around based on market conditions.
Just upgrade what's fun for you. Don't overthink about the perspective of other people especially in regard of gatekeeping.   People will gatekeep their shit regardless of item level and will always prefer juiced characters. Even if you are 1475 and have 5x3, I doubt PUGs will accept you. Even me as a 1490 I still constantly get rejected on Clown and the only time I'm getting instantly accepted is if I use my 1520+ characters.
If your reaper has a 9/7 stone then that sounds like a main to me
upgrade the one you feel most comfortable learning a new raid, but if reaper is your main then this is the one, also 5x3 is big advantage for finding groups
Yes KR recently got an updated for GS and DE to be able to holster their weapons while idle, like other classes. Not sure when we'll get the update though.
There should be, based on the consistent pattern of releases it’s safe to assume the update will come with 1540 and 1560 chaos dungeons
Fppc is standard for party finder only. For matchmaking, call whatever you want to do or throw a flare
1. If you want to flare, race to be first. If multiple flares are thrown, whoever appears first in chat wins and second person is expected to throw one of the remaining three items.  2. Call 1, 2, or C in chat. If you want C you better type fast. First come first serve. If only two people type then it's assumed the third will get whatever is left.  Same goes for Cali, just replace D for C. If you can't handle the wild west of matchmaking then stick to party finder.
What does fppc stand for?
Continue buying mari shop and keep your selectors until you have enough for both sets.  1 selector is not worth the effort to farm rowen.  get the free galataur from the legend map achievement btw.
It's been x3 / x3+1 in NAW for about a year or so now.
I heard it actually was region dependent? I know in NAE it's standard practice to do 3x but I seem to remember hearing a while back that in EU they do NESW? Could be wrong. Anecdotally I can attest that I haven't seen a group do NESW since Argos launched, everyone assumes and does 3x.
People in my region tend to do nesw for argos and 3x everywhere else
Hello. The gatekeeping is a lie. I'll explain myself : most people without the requirement try to fit in experienced raid as impostor. Because obviously experienced raid will be faster and smoother. They are the artisan of their own gatekeeping.  You just have to do like every experienced player before you : - run the raid as learning party (for the last raid there are quit a lot of them). - gear your character to a certain point for it. Like 5x3, gem 7 for Brel. 5x3 is cheap right now don't be overwhelm by it. The class you play doesn't matter in group cause every class is playable and can clear raid (as shown by first hellbrel clean with a scooter in it in korea).  Once you are experienced enough you can go into experienced group. And no, clearing Brel 1-6 once doesn't mean you are experienced in this raid.  In conclusion : do it the same way experienced people did it :  - Join learning party, clear once - join horn lobby once you get the horn clear from 5 to 10 time for title. -join experienced lobby asking for phantom legion commander requiring Brel to be cleaned 10 times.  There is no shortcut to be experienced just do the raid and don't try to fit in experienced party while you're not.  People always look at the best player saying it's unfair they can't reach their lvl or group with them without understanding we were all beginner in the raid first and we put quit a lot of time to learn.
If you're talking strictly about getting accepted into parties, then I wouldn't say it's difficult, but you do need to play consistently to make sure your character is progressing and getting stronger. If you say you haven't reached endgame yet then without any other context I'd say that rate of play will make it difficult to progress your character at a healthy rate.  Once you get to that point it's easy to maintain, but it takes an effort to get there if you're not there already
There are a lot of criteria people look at when accepting an application to a party, some of them are just flat minimums you must have and some are relative to everyone else applying and how long they want to wait for someone better. If you're geared well and aren't at minimum ilevel for the raid it's not too terrible.  For a returning or new player there's a bit of a Catch-22 to earn your titles, as it's hard to get into raids that have been out for a while without already having the title. Party Finder can be quite long and/or frustrating at times, but it gets better the closer you get to the highest ilevels.
Raids aren't really difficult if you study them. It ends up turning like most MMOs, where the hardest part of the content is finding groups that aren't deadweights.  Gatekeeping has been relaxing a bit lately, but I've also seen an increase in people silently hoping to get carried. It seems player skill is low across the board rn, which means it's a good time to learn for players who are genuinely interested in the game
You need to get to 1375 to sell those items. It was an attempt to stop bots from flooding the market but it's pretty much useless now because bots can get to 1375 so easily with recent updates.
Dash and Stand-up Actions are in their own cooldown category and will need specific effects that states as sucb, like the card set Romanticist.    Classes that rely heavily on Relic sets to be considered "complete" do poorly (Striker and Reaper as example) in  equalized contents.
According to ATK's youtube video with Lustboy (a famous theorycrafter), regarding 5x3+1, it doesn't really matter whether you go pm3/ad1 or ad3/pm1.  I'm facing the same dilemma when ancients arrive, and since I happen to have PM books and I'm one of the five players in LA who loves SRF, I'm going pm3/ad1.  Regarding the card set, deep dive/LWC are fine before LOS18.
From KR,    Highest Damage Potential - 3333+2+1.   Grudge, Keen Blunt Weapon, Cursed Doll, Hit Master, Adrenaline 2 and Peacemaker 1.    Deep Dive set seems easier to complete while you wait for Light of Salvation or Kazeros' Legion Commander (non-Demon high end contents coming our way that are weak to Dark).
it is viable but PM1 will be a couple % ahead, as far as SRF goes theres really no good reason to use it, even at PM3  5x3+1 setups will be expensive and not expected of you for quite a while so if its a cost issue, dont worry about it yet
She's okay, I've been playing her since around September as an alt and while the class is really fun the damage really is kinda depressing at times. I'm probably swapping over to Peacemaker at some point in the next few months.   That's not to criticize the build too heavily though, it really is a pretty fun spec. I just prefer Critflux when it comes to a class I can turn my brain off and chill with since Critflux still does decent damage.  My overall thoughts on Swift TTH are a bit more complex than I'm letting on here, but I'm trying to keep this somewhat "concise"
Its okay but the problem is that you need very very high uptime to come close in damage to other specs. It wont compete vs the top dogs (master summoner, igniter, surge, barrage, etc.) but its a solid tier below if you have that very high uptime. If you dont, its middling at best.
Idk whats "good" meant to be, its fun thats all I can say. Its not the most optimized for top dps like PM GS, so u wont come near that DPS-wise, but its less punishing and easier to pick up
If you want full rest bonus for Monke, today is the last day you can do dailies. There is a 1540 and 1560 Chaos Dungeon yeah, we are probably getting them next week but technically these haven't been confirmed yet. I'd be shocked if we don't get them.
There isn't, I think usually only event related freebies have expiration dates. Stuff you pay actual money for doesn't. Except for crystal aura of course.
My vote is on the 2nd one. Artist doesn't scale well with Spec and losing out on 53 Swift isn't that bad. More damage for the party is always welcome, and iirc Dagger applies for both parties in 8 people raids so you get quite a lot out of it (correct me if I'm wrong, not 100% sure).
The one with main stats be a long shot
/u/UltFiction was just looking in the wrong place.  Go to Achievements > Character > Items > Scroll to the Bottom.  >Phantom Shard Remnants   >   >Regardless of set, Equip 6 pieces of Phantom Legion Commander Relic Gear at the same time.   [https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/211205756941238272/1093651175863230464/image.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/211205756941238272/1093651175863230464/image.png)  I completed this 01/26/2023. Achievements are **roster wide** so you only need 1 character to have full 6pc Brel NM gear in order to craft Ancient on your account. That being said you need a piece of Brel NM gear to swap to Ancient. You *should* get the old horns back though so as long as you accumulate 100 total horns you can swap what Brel NM piece you have you should be fine.
No it’ll probably be the intro quest to the raid like all raids have had thus far. I’m just speculating though
Nope. Those kinds of passives don't stack in any way. If they are similar types then it just uses the best version.
No if you read the descriptions on any berald information card, it does say the effect does not stack.  Other passives such as ship speed does stack though.
Their DPS is similar, but their damage profile is different.  Spec LC damage profile leans towards your bird damage (accounting around 25% of your total damage) while Swift LC damage profile leans towards your main skills instead (you roughly do more casts on your normal skills as Swift LC over Spec LC).
same no need to rest
Adding to it, it seems that next rewards come with Akkan so there's a long way to go.
Correct maxing any one of them will give you the island soul, it's just for completionist reasons like having them in your SH or if you want to know more about their backstory (rapport quests).
Optimal? Rmt from players, not bots. Safest, buy Royal crystals to buy skins then sell the skins on AH. Currency Exchange for gold is a rip off, but you could still do it, but then you have to wait 3 days to use it in the AH. You can use it right away to hone tho.
the premium ark pass prabably gives you the most mats for your money. otherwise its kinda expensive to buy upgrade mats with cash
the key issue is people are not familiar with eso stat distributions since strikers are relatively rare and most are deathblow. People see the rainbow mix of stats and assume its troll build since 95% of lost ark classes are 1 or 2 stat builds
I think a lot of people look at Eso striker as more of a budget build and compared to deathblow, it is because deathblow is one of the most expensive builds to create. A lot of strikers at that ilvl will also be deathblow so you are essentially competing with them and everyone knows deathblow is one of the hardest hitting classes in the game.
Low dmg maybe
class is something you dont wanna change once you got to a certain point in progression, which for you is kinda far away.   In general the best advice is, try as much as you can and go with the most fun/enjoyable one.
Yes the farm replaced that island
Oh you can split the gates like that? Thank you
Is there a reason I never see any groups for it? Been checking for the past month or so and it's just as dead as rehearsal's party finder
Thank you! Is the calculator weird on mobile? I checked the boxes for +19 gear which should be 1475 but it says it’s like 1560?
Number 1 uses Flare, 2 uses Phero, 3 uses Phero, 4 uses Corrosive
It's not really like it takes that much time to do Rowen, you can skip Tulubik if you want. The rest takes maybe 30-45 minutes max a week? It's guaranteed progress towards a guaranteed selection pouch. If their goal is to have it buy week 1 of HM Brel they can just keep buying packs and if they get it they get it, if they don't they'll get the selection pack in a few weeks and just get it that way.
I would not advise buying Mari shop packs. They are really cost inefficient if you are close to maxing sets. Takes 28 random legendary packs on average to get the card you want if you're one away and that's 19,600 blue crystals worth of the 7 legend- rare packs. Which is 500k gold on my server. Just wait out till you get a selector from weekly challenge abyssal and never go into it without a good chunk of gold.
I'm NAW! I just got back from the game so I am eager to please these strangers so I may just clarify.  Also just rolled a Scrapper, she seems fun!!
EUC Argos = NESW  EUC Brel = x3  EUC Valtan/Vykas/Clown = Select spots in the battle workshop by standing on each position, they don't use either system.
> Classes that rely heavily on Relic sets to be considered "complete" do poorly (Striker and Reaper as example) in equalized contents.  My roster consists on Paladin, Emperor Arcana, EW Deadeye, EO Soulfist, Hunger Reaper and LC Sharpshooter (Swiftness); should I go with Soulfist or Deadeye then?  EDIT: Thank you both!
Out of interest, why do you love SRF? It’s so slow for not that much damage.  Personally though, I also dislike the alternative of bullet rain but I prefer it to SRF as it gives more manoeuvrability and you’re not animation locked.
Thank you
Oh so spec doenst increase my damage buff? What’s increase efficiency of moonfall mean then
Sorry what does this phrase mean? One with main stats is good or not good?
Ah okay thanks!
Oh, good to know that speed does. Thanks for the extra tip!
You'll still have to wait 3 days to sell the skins too, but yeah the skins give better returns
Yeah you can swap in between however you want. For example Vykas buses run g1 NM and then 2-3 HM but I believe.you could technically run any combo of NM/HM as long as you run each gate in order and only run each gate 1x
Match make, I don’t think I’ve ever used party finder for challenge stuff
Party finder is for content that require some coordination or gear requirement from a personal perspective (people asking 5x3 for example).  Since in challenge guardians and raids everyone gets toned down it doesn't make much sense to do that, also the mechanics are pretty straight forward.
You're probably working with upper relic gear? +19 upper relic is 1580. Just double check and make sure you're using lower relic Valtan/Vykas gear from the dropdown
Change the kind of gear you're honing on the left side from brel to argos, might be different on mobile.
Awesome thanks
I've been a Shock Scrapper since launch (well, I started about a month after launch) and even with every other class I've played she's still my favorite. Regardless which spec you play she's my favorite class, hope you enjoy her!
I think your Deadeye needs Entropy set bonus for its full potential (and frustration of having to back attack while being a "ranged dps"). Ultimately, I say go in with whatever you feel most comfortable going in as since you need a decently sized group first to clear.
Hunger Reaper isn't too bad, the main draw of equalized content is the stats being reduced which can severely hurt spec classes. With Hunger you just need to fill the bar once and you'll be mostly fine, although the loss of Entropy will make you hit less, at least it won't feel too awful.        Soulfist is okay, losing dominion does hurt too as you'll end up with a lot of down-time but you can still pump out some damage in Hype 3.
I would use LC Sharpshooter, it doesn't rely on tripod levels like DS so you just use Fenrir at the start and have the hawk out all the time.
Honestly, it just feels and sounds so impactful :D it does decent damage but the cooldown is looong.
It does, but the increase is very minor, similar to Paladin.
Sorry I misspelled a word lol. The bracelet with both main stats Spec/Swift is better.
Oh yea I forgot they made skins un tradable for a bit after purchase. Was that for bots too?   Honestly If they just lowered the RC to gold conversion they could price bots out an more ppl would prolly buy, so any loss would be made up for imo.
Yup some people were doing Vykas HHN at the very start, you can swap freely after each gate.
Good to know
Oookay, makes sense. Thanks
Oh thanks that was it.
Problem is mana costs, I play swift LC with Nightmare and Dominion. Without relic it would feel really bad.
Give it a try, stats get reduced by a lot and gems aren't applied as well so I think you should be fine, worst case add some focus runes :p

There are 2 obvious Cali seeds. One he is nearly afk and the other he is in a breakdancing competition. Shits wack.

I miss deskaluda man.Perfect guardian for daily chore .No bulshit mec no battle item need you have counter play for guardian leaving.  It seems they try more complex each time on daily guardian which I dont like .This is daily homework content it should be fun not annoying .
That's every guardian......We have too many back attack players or players just don't know how to keep boss still. Hitmaster be chasing ass for no reason.

Looks great, if only all the guardians had a similar layout like this, maybe with different terrains 😕
Bro look at all those mages
It's 100% intentional design, given that the charge is going to be Paromensa's most common opening attack 95% of the time because it's the only attack she can queue while people run to her from out of range (the only time it's not her opening attack is when someone quickly uses a movement skill to close the distance who also happens to be her first target).  The devs are having a laugh just as much as you.
completely normal behavior

Didn’t even realize looking at the picture wtf xd And all of them with 20 glow biggest whale class confirmed

just because you're newer/not as active and +20 seems unobtainable to you doesn't mean people with +20s are whales
i am playing since march last year, am at 4k+ hours played and have a roster of 1x1565  5x1540 as my top 6. So i am not new and not inactive. Still im gonna tell you sorc is the biggest whale class since 80% of people i see running around with a +20 and low roster are sorcs ;)
150 roster here, got two +20 brel weapons. Didn't invest a cent in game. What roster has to do with something? Anything beyond 130 is like more than enough. I'm only 150 because I used free powerpass es and hyper express on all my alts one by one and used kt on all of them (I think I did south vern twice tho). Also I'm at 2900 hours played.
If you don't have a +20 by now on at least one of your characters & you play a full roster of 6, then that is your own fault.
20 weapon is achievable   you should look at the gems, if its a full level 10 gems than yeah they’re indeed a whale  or maybe they play 24 sorcs I know someone from the discord is like that and they have i think full level 10
Because literally everyone made a sorc as their first main, it's the zerker that isn't being gatekept. Naturally it's gonna be the most well-geared class if a vast majority of sorcs are everyones mains.
If you have a +20 weapon you are putting the focus on other priorities.  The “smart” thing would be to get 6x 1560 chars by reset next week instead of one fully pumped out one.  However it all depends on how you enjoy the game. So don’t judge others by their efficiency
It's hard to compare the two as they fill different roles.     Paladin is a support. The easiest and most pug friendly support at that since all your buffs are aoe 24m radius, shield is aoe 24m radius, aura last for 16s and heal, give dmg boost and damage reduction.     Berserker is a dps, a very strong dps, is very easy to play and since the rework is actually visually pleasing on top of being actually fun
I say zerk is easier because you just blow your load and then afk until it comes back up  Except paladin is the same, spend your cds, wait for the next one, except much much slower   The hardest part I find about playing Paladin is to fight the urge to fall asleep. But that might just be me who knows
Is that even a comparison?
It's like asking what do prefer to eat fish or meat?
Paladin's the most boring job in the game. No, not because it's a support, I run all three in my main six and up till Artist came out mained Bard and love it. The main issue with Paladin is it's like it only has 5-6 relevant buttons in your standard rotation, on relatively long CDs for the most part. Holy Sword and Executor's are exclusively saved for counters/stagger, and in Guardian Raids I run Punishment as well for a total of three blues that you can basically ignore until they're needed.  Most of the gameplay you can just walk around. 21% > brand > LoJ > Holy Protection to open then you're kind of twiddling your thumbs, which not only is more boring it is less effective than on Artist/Bard where you utilize this time to build meter constantly which produces more damage for the group. You can do the C/J build and try and effectively use Godsent Law and Sword of Justice for a little something to do but you can only do it once every 30s and it's just a gamble. Both Bard and Artist you're constantly racing to keep uptime well and launch a barrage of meter builders before you have to 21% and brand again, then utilize your constant Zs well.  I feel like the job needs a little bit of a rework, mainly in the meter department. Maybe have two bars to fill up or something, so meter building is more applicable and less on rails based on Awakening.
paladin pros: sup  zerk pros: its broken, you play with your eyes closed youll still mvp
Paladin is an autopilot class, very easy, kinda boring, however it's an all-round decent support.
Support = boring as fuck so automatically loses
The new changes making zerk feel super nice.im thinking about replacing my 1500 pally with my 1445 zerk. Im not much of a support player and i only made hik because when i was in an active guild we needed supports.
I would say berserker, although I don't have one and I am using the similarities between Berserker and Slayer, which is the one I am waiting for 😅
So i wouldnt have problems getting into pugs with the berserker as well?
Me too. I feel sleepy finding party as a paladin and fall asleep playing paladin.
Both pally mains in my static quit the game because how boring it is.
why is that?
[removed]
That explains why they keep dying.
Come on over brother. I dropped my 1540 pally for my Zerker when the express came out, best decision I've ever made.
You won't be gatekept cause you're a zerk. If you don't get accepted it's because of other reasons.
Zerkers aren't as gatekept as they used to be but if you're not accepted it'd likely be from other factors (gems, cards, ilvl, engravings) my 5x3 ilvl 1535 zerker alt have no problem getting into any parties now, pre-rework nobody would accept it
Zerk is completely ok as long as there is nothing sus like weird stats, engravings, tier2 gems, tanking card, etc.
Paladin is considered to be among more boring or the most boring class for most people.
one is a dps one is a support. people already snooze on support and pally is considered boring even amongst support classes
It's is a support and the other is a dps. Pally is a support so it's auto s tier. You can't really compare supports to dps. Pretty much all dps need the same stuff to be "good". Supports are borderline mandatory so.... they are not the same thing.
I mean one is dps and the other is support the playstyles are fundamentally different.

zerk pros: tankiest class in the game
Mine sitting at 1445 with enuf mats to boost it past 1490. I def might been saving gold since brel coming out soon.
>You won't be gatekept cause you're a zerk.  thats not entirely true. i know a lot of people who want MUCH higer requirements in terms of titles, roster level, cards, etc on a zerker than most other classes.
for a nub player can u please clarify more?
4th tankiest.
These days I don't gatekeep Zerkers that hard anymore, maybe slightly more than average because the average Zerker is more of a DPS Gorilla than even the other DPS Monkeys in PF but most Zerkers especially towards the endgame aren't that bad. I see Reapers get gatekept much harder.
Berserker had a bad reputation in the community because their damage was bad and the playstyle was pretty stupid, you'd have all these charged skills (think of charged skill as cast time but you can't cancel it to move otherwise it goes on cooldown and do no damage) but you had no tenacity (tenacity is like super armor) so most zerker would do pitiful damage or get hit by practically everything and die.  They recently got reworked and now their rotation make sense, is fluid and there's no more charging skill so their damage went up by quite a bit and it's a lot easier to avoid getting hit.  Those changes allow zerker to use 4 skills in their red dust buff window over the original 2 skills. (red dust is a zerker skill that increase your attack power by 24% and crit chance by 30% for 6 seconds     As for cards, gem, ilvl and engravings those are just layers part of character  progression that increase your damage, lower cooldown, increase defence, etc. Things people look at before they accept you for a raid
zerks suffered from public opinion being negative about the class (streamers fault) and thoughts/ideas are powerful things. As a result Zerks got gatekept b/c of this prevailing idea regardless of how true it was.    The rework along with the vocal positive thoughts about it have erased much of that bias so gatekeeping based solely on the class alone is no longer much of a thing  These are the standard things ppl gatekeep for which every class faces  (gems, cards, ilvl, engravings)   Best progression order seems to be   1)Ilvl to 1450-1460, at the same time Gems to all lvl5 (sell all gems after to fund upgrades)  3)5x3 engraving (I'd personally buy all the accessories first all at once & cut a stone (doesn't have to be the final stone but just one that works enough). Then buy the legendary engraving books followed by cutting more stones if you need to. Doing it this way you can progress from 4x3 to 5x3 seamlessly while getting most of the work done at the start. This means you'll have less chance at being gatekept earlier on.   You can also push Ilvl to 1472.5 once you have 4x3 / 4x3 + 2 engraving setup. It's debatable which one helps out more   4)lvl7 gems  5)Push Ilvl  &#x200B;  Cards are just a pain, nothing you can really do here besides get as many as you can while playing and only spend card exp on the sets you'll need since card exp is hard to come by.

I think Consistent DPS are only better than burst DPS when a new raid is released for 3- 4 weeks or for a couple of months.  After that burst should be king cus players already have over geared the raid and know the mechanic of the raid.   But still skill > class
Burst matters when the boss has clearly defined damage windows. But most of the burst classes often come with the downside of having a much harder time securing damage outside of those windows (see: igniter sorc on a mobile boss) so if you can't quickly move from one window to the other they will not perform above consistent damage classes.  Another thing is there's absolutely no need for peak performance in any non-hell content atm. Brel hard G6 was the first time people had to throw darks on cooldown to meet damage requirements, some groups will definitely struggle on it but it won't be anything like the original release due to nerfs and powercreep.
So this recent video was put out by Kanima and I find it interesting because usually we see tier lists which argue for Burst DPS, with the most recent one thats relevant to NA/EU region being the one made by Legalia. **Essentially his argument is that consistent dps is more favorable to burst dps because most relevant raids from here on out will not be outgeared so easily. As a result consistent DPS matters a lot more because skipping mechs will be less frequent.** What are your general thoughts on Kanimas argument that ultimately consistent dps is more important than burst?
imo theres no such thing as a burst class other than igniter.  &#x200B;  the other "burst classes" are just consistent dps dealers except they have an extra 1 or 2 spells that do more damage, or a long cd form/buff where their rotation does more damage. outside of that, their damage equals the "consistent" dps classes  &#x200B;  whereas igniter LITERALLY doesnt do damage outside of ignite, and their infinite duration dps is among the lowest (but still not the lowest!)
[removed]
I feel like byrat will always be better on raids on classes that can keep their meter  thorough mechs (like igniter). Having your downtime being during a mech is so much better for them. My barrage artilleristi out damages my Tai scrapper by a ton in raids for this reasons. Even though my tai is much better geared.
Kanima is a reasonable dude but does tend to not support his own arguments and then just repeat stuff 10x.  Legalia is a smug elitist that likes to over-emphasize differences in order to have something to be smug about and create content for his smug viewers.  >	What are your general thoughts on Kanimas argument that ultimately consistent dps is more important than burst?  The content does not necessitate either. Both work. If anything a mix of them makes a groups damage a bit more predictable and manageable.  Mechs being skipped in significant way means that the content is already outgeared. Being smug about outgeared content is laughable.
Id say you somewhat misunderstood his point.   His point was more like, in prog content or content where you cant overgear to push mechanics b2b, consistent dps classes usually perform closer, if not better than burst classes.   Similarily when he was talking about the hell brel clear he said something along the lines of: first clear group had many consistent dps and zero igniter sorcs. While the igniter sorcs were at g6 learning their burst window the consistent dps group were already mich deeper into the fight.   Consistency is more effective than higher potential with less consistency.  He also distinguished that once content is in farm status, burst will be king.
Burst is giga broken bc of atros and gems. Constant dps comes nowhere near when the boss is phased instantly. On item level consistent has a better footing, could beat out burst. But farm content burst will always be better.  Interested to see what "not being able to overgear" means for the coming future. KR guys are like 1620 doing brel hard at 1560 right? Isn't that fairly overgeared?
Depends on the type of burst. Yeah igniter sorc will be harder to pull off later on. But a lot of "burst" classes in the Top tier Do so much damage during and out of their burst window that consistent damage can't keep up.  A lot of burst classes are just synergy busted they do about as much damage as a consistent dps outside of their burst and 2-3x their damage during.
akkan is def mech to mech now, i guess he's talking about voldike but they'll probably get another big power spike from whatever thaemine drops
builder spender is probably a better description.  Surge and Deathblow are same thing as igniter -- smidge until you build meter and dump it
It's a spectrum from a spike in between flats to raised flatlands. That's why the parse for 6-15s is useful because igniter is not a burst class if you consider 5mins. The window for dps gets tighter the higher the total dps of the party is, if the boss stands for 6s then next mechanic already then the dmg window is 6s. Now pair that with synergies, buffs, atros and dark bombs then gap between classes increases.

No I did not misinterpret what he said. Watch the video he explicitly makes the argument that farm content is irrelevant since any class can be inserted to complete it and that as we continue to get higher ilvl content the benefits from skipping mech to mech will significantly diminish as seen in voldike. I misinterpreted nothing. This does not take away from content that IS currently on farm still favoring burst classes. This however is the first argument at least I’ve seen to suggest optimizing for farm content is irrelevant. Also on that note his conclusion was that there was no “king” or favored class. Each class or however way you wanted to categorize classes has merit. His argument ultimately really did end up becoming this by the end of the video.
All raid become farm at some point.  I don't see his argument
We also spend the majority of the time farming raids instead of progging them.   So having stacked burst classes is infinitely >>> consistent classes due to the nature of the game.
BrelH is considered farm as well. I guess he means voldike and something else maybe?idk how strong they are vs akkan h
Kanima was talking about akkan, you can overgear akkan normal but akkan hard, not so much. Because once akkan is out max iLvl will be 1615 iirc.
The difference is how long it takes to build up your identity. Igniter is ~30s cooldown, surge is 15s +-, LTS is about the same. So they all perform better on a 6s scale (to varying degrees). Master summoner for instance can drop akir every ~8 seconds but it can dump generators all at once to just barely fit two akirs in 6s window, otherwise it wouldn't be much of a burst class.
Once players who play burst classes know when to burst, they will outperform consistent dps for the most part. Kanima said that, as well as there being no need to optimize farm content in terms of what dps class to bring (burst or consistent).  Which I agree with.  I don’t remember him saying that the benefit of pushing mech to mech will diminish, rather we simply won’t be able to do that in the future due to having to push that much hp that fast due to the sheer amount of hp there is to burn to get to the next mechanic. Unless you are going for a full party with maxed esther weapon this will stay true for the most part.  So I actually agree with him that the upcoming raids will favor consistent dps classes more compared to the raids we had until this point. I like it this way.
Depends on how raids are balanced and gear pacing. We assume all content becomes farm at some point, but he also has a valid point that the difference between end game raids and maximum achievable ilvl is becoming smaller with new updates. It's also still significantly more difficult to hone from here on out. I'm going to assume you didnt watch the video, but his explicitly states that current content in KR cannot be bursted from mech to mech. I havent watched KR streams lately so I do not recall if Akkan HM is bursted mech to mech. If it isn't his perspective holds water. He also makes the argument "Farm content" isn't really as important as many people make it out to be, that progression is the most important aspect of raiding. It's an interesting take that isn't often expressed.
I think the counter argument for this is that farm raids are farmed raids. It's not gonna be any much harder with all consistent dps since you can still have optimized dps rotation as you master the raid, overgeared + non existent dps checks. Ofc it's still an easier time with stacked burst classes but having stacked consistent classes shouldn't be too bad. We reach a point where switching to a similar geared consistent dps adds only a slight delay to total raid time since mechanics eat more of the total time.
Have you ever played an Entropy class? The boss isn't just standing there every for you to dump every 15 seconds
Think he’s referring to Voldike. Ignoring Zeals melting the bosses Hp Down with his WD and Slayer, the fights are def longer and gives more shine to Consistent DPS classes now
I don't know man. I clown is a lot easier and quicker on my burst classes that can easily skip maze and mario 3/4.
It's not about having an easy or hard time.   It's about having a quick time when doing every raid 6+ times a week.   Consistent easy classes have a leg up to burst classes for 4-5 pulls until people get used to patterns.   It's entirely negligible.   Burs potential makes even prog raids easier as you can push into certain patterns on demand.   I've 2 consistent DPS at 1540 so it's not like i'm a hater, but they're simply inferior to burst classes even on prog raids after the first ~5 pulls.
LTS has a 15 second cooldown, how tf do you expect to use it every 3-4s 🤦‍♂️
I’m going to disagree with you about prog raiding and burst classes. Just because you have a few consistent dps at 1540 doesn’t mean they are proof of inferior performance in raids. Your main which I will presume is a burst class has a clear advantage of gear. I have two burst classes at 1540 as well which I could push to 1550 probably today, but whatever. They both have lv 9/10 gems and a 100 quality weapon. Both weapons are +18. The Glaivier out performs them both in all content, which is 1570 and 82 quality +20 weapon with mostly lv 10s. At the end of the day a more geared character will always outperform. Comparing your alts to your main for definitive conclusions as to which is superior is asinine. You can only make a truly objective opinion in your case once your alt reaches full comparability with your main and you have logged consistent hours/runs with equivalent gear. Now if you happen to play with someone else who plays your counterpart who has similar progression to you in all relevant areas to include cards and is assuredly as skilled as you are, sure make your prog comparisons. Though I think it’s generally accepted even in KR currently that burst classes suffer to perform in all prog content until it is no longer prog.
Depends how overgeared you are. At a certain point Consistent damage will be so overgeared that Burst classes can't get their stack/gage fast enough to dps.  There are busted consistent damage classes like shock scrapper/mayhem zerker/eso wardancer that makes it hard for bursts to keep up in Farm/prog.
Ah you said cooldown, the comment before is talking about meter. 🤷🏻‍♂️
No one is comparing alt performance to main performance other than you lol
Just wanted to come in here and chime in with some personal experience. I have a 1565 sorc (not my main since my main is a bard but who's counting). I used to play reflux, up to until brel, where I was sick of the lack of damage and committed to full swap to igniter. I've never looked back. The damage is not even close, igniter just dumps all over reflux. I still have my full reflux build and when I was switching over I still used it on fights that I'm not as comfortable on igniter, but now the only fight I use my reflux build on is prokel.   That is my personal experience anyways.   As for progging, reflux is definitely easiler to prog from the first pull. The build pretty much let's you ignore everything, whatever your doing you can just do without caring about what the boss is doing. You don't need to hold abilities. You don't need to wait for windows. You don't need to learn windows. You don't need to coordinate with your team for windows (cause you don't really have any). But for igniter I think if you get a few good pulls in (like 5 ish), you would know enough to start just dumping your damage at obvious windows, and the damage is not really comparable at all.   Though my progging it's slightly different since my sorc is my second character. I prog raids on my bard first since it's my main.    Just my thoughts on the matter.
I'm talking about how often those classes can unload their damage, yes. Some of them work through meter generation (igniter), some work through some weird stacking mechanic (surge), others are simply cooldown based.
You literately just did when you brought up your 1540 alts.
In the case of deathblow it’s more of a consistent damage in 3 bursts. Still very different from ignite and surge. Tiger emerges and blast formation do a BIG percentage of dmg. And there is barely any downtime on deathblow. It’s really not like surge or ignite.   The main upside vs swift classes is if the boss goes into DR you can use your stronger skills again which benefits longer cooldowns
Thast was to point out that i've no bias against it, because i myself literally enjoy playing them.
True, but it still has an option of grouping up its big skills in quick succession doesn't it? Since you don't need 15 seconds to build up meter for 2 other skills.
But yet you claim they are inferior. You explicitly say this. Huh?
Not quick per say. You can only fit LTS and Emerges in 8s. Which is still a very powerful burst in 8s especially if you can line up the lazenith buff.   The full cycle with blast is just about 12s. Which requires the boss not interrupting you and spinning.   Ofc the 8s burst is way better than what an eso striker or a pistoleer would output for example. Which is funny cause it’s just a way better consistent dps - as long as you hit the main skills.
You can skip orbs mechanic at Vykas G1? Wow, never saw it before. You just changed my world.
Small point for Valtan G1 Orb mechanic if you rely on the orb count under his healthbar:  If you hit the invader before the mech starts, you will see the health bar of the invader at the top of your screen and won't see how many stacks (orbs collected) the boss has. Just hit the boss once he teleported to the middle to make sure you see the correct healthbar.
Returning player here, this is great information.  Big thanks for taking the time.
Velganos mech in gate 2 clown happens at 55 bars not 75 just so people don't get confused
>I'm gonna list few things  Just a few...
thank you so much for this seriously
actual useful, when i returned couple months ago I joined learning parties and a lot of them wouldn't use the known pug strats pugs use so I would be confused asking around in twitch or in game, sotra like a pug strat/ unspoken rules in raiding cheat sheet
For Valtan gate 2 ghost phase timestop. If its hard to count how many times the right arm hit the floor. You can instead count both punches, the 5th punch (should be the right arm) and that is when you use timestop.
Also, if you play on SA we never do x3, if you see someone type argos or argos+1 means: 1 top, 2 right, 3 bottom and 4 left.
Nice guide!!
the frog thing was super confusing, thanks for the clarification
Thank you so much for this! I just hit 1445 on one of chars and been a little confused looking at the group names for Valtan.
Wow you are so nice to type all that for newer players!
Not a new player but ty for this. I still need to learn Vykas,Kakul and Brel and these will help me .
For anyone wanting video guides, search <raid name> guide ATK. He explains it really well: boss mech, community strats, your positioning and roles, boss hard hitting attack, sidereal usage, etc.
Boring
Lol there's very minimal rng involved with patterns from G3 clown.  99% of the time it can be ruled down to skill.
Vykas G3 typing test there's only ever 6 combinations of letters: Qweasd.
Also, keep in mind that some people's rules are different than OP's.  Sometimes people will want you to know and do other things that aren't suggested here.  Just remember at the end of the day it's a video game and you're not obligated to play how anyone else expects you to.  The most important thing is to have fun.
First time im seeing tsing ghost phase transition, both in text and in practice. In case you had to save-ts one too many times slow classes usually go top and faster go bottom  starting from 2nd slam.
In Brel gate 5, how do you decide who stays outside the portal in party 2 and who collects the stacks? Does the support always collect the stacks?
As someone who just got to 1445. These mechanics are great but super confusing (boss strata in general not your write up) and I regret getting my support up to 1445 first as I’m still learning and it gimps the group when I mess up and makes a LOT of people salty.
Thanks. I'll try brel g1&2 next but there are no learning parties. This guide helps.
I have a question about Vykas G1 stagger blue/black orb mechanic. If my spot is 11 and I get a black orb should I swap with 7 or 1?
Clown g1. if the boss turns do the leg thing
If you push blue guy far enough he'll skip the gates on 1st and safe spot spotting in 2nd   The windows for this is before he splits into parties and while he's in stagger/balls
technically you can also skip G2 orbs, but it's way harder than G1 at our level because you need to burst 65+ bars during a long pattern like the whaffles.
You can even push him to 0 bars shortly before and during the stagger mechanic (his DR only starts after the stagger orbs are done). After party switch the other ones will straight get their stagger. Seen people also calling it so others dont get surprsed.
If your raid hits hard enough and you drop a dark bomb on him when you first go in with everyone unloading, it’s pretty consistent.
brel weapon characters skip it yup
Corrected :D
![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|smile)
That was exactly the idea   Im gonna do an update later on this post probably tooday for Brelshaza unspoken PUG rules
![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thumbs_up)
![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|smile)
Except for Brel,  [Memorizer](https://www.youtube.com/@memorizer92) has imo better Brel guides than ATK
Thank you.
Does any typing test use more or less characters as pool? I feel like brel typing tests have fewer characters to type than clown g3m4 and vykas being between those, but all the same base set. I'm not even remotely sure about the length though
better safe then sorry imo  unless u will have balthor for it
99% of the time yes because they have shields and stuff they also do much more stagger to the cube if they collect those other orbs too besides those 12 stacks that they need to have to survive the next mechanic. Outside the portal - the lowest stagger characters most of the time
ye thats another story tho . Learning parties for Brel are rare to see after this content has been out since december
it doesnt matter at this point people adjust accordingly to the color they got
True i forgot about that   You can do it when she does the red walls but i only did it once in all my Vykas runs
Or the first party can push blue during the stagger/black -blue as boss takes full DMG until in/out showcase
I switched after g3 to memo because i wasn't understanding any fucking thing of the g4 guide from atk, memorizer is just better at explaining crucial points.
>Create Post  I agree
Im not too sure tbh, im usually the one running m4 lol. For brel I've seen the letters R and F, but the length I feel are the same for vykas/brel. Though for me personally I feel that G3M4 clown typing test is the longest.
I saw a video from a 3 man bus 1620+ who nearly skipped, so as 8 I think with brel hard coming, some 1560+ party could start to do it if they hard try for fun (dark/atro, keeping burst...) and it'll probably be more common closer to akkan release with 1580+, higher gems, los30.
Yeah, it was a nightmare at first progging g1-3 with my buddys as they all watched ATK vids on it. Where as I looked at maxroll and mobalytics alongside Memorizer and had much better understanding. However was hard to talk over everyone getting frustrated partially cause few people were on ilvl and kept dying to everything.
this was really nice
Great vid
thank you for explaining everything with calm and a cadence that really helps take in the information. It was like you were explaining this casually to a friend instead of all the usual info dumps out there.
bro posted a whole ass run, lol
<3
That's how I lead my guild raids haha glad you like it
To be fair. It’s exactly what the title says it is. He didn’t lie at least
The most annoying thing is that YouTube won't let me do Chapters because apparently, you need to have 1000 subscribers to unlock that feature... Weird stuff.
Getting gatekept in Lost Ark is not enough, now YouTube has to gatekeep small content creators...
What??? Makes literally no sense lmao YT is so weird
Yea, I thought it was kinda counterintuitive, cause I assumed you'd WANT small creators to have the tools that can make their videos more watchable :')
Is he going to add reflux sorc?
Still some classes missing here including sharpshooter. Arcana is hard to simulate due to card rng which dramatically affects dps so that not being here makes sense.
Grab the popcorn...
Funny. Just proves again that entropy classes do have a higher ceiling in a vacuum. But the fact that Hitmaster classes are only 1-3% less while having much easier ability to have uptime. That proved beyond any reasonable doubt that the game is designed for hit master classes to thrive in raids.
dps pala so good it's not even listed
Wake up babe new spreadsheet about best DPS classes just dropped.
The chart now has Robust Spirit Soulfist, and I believe some numbers have been updated for certain classes. Most important columns are probably 6s DPS and eDPS (efficient DPS). Enjoy at your own risk.
what does 7m slayer vs 6m slayer mean?
For both builds of SF, what does the "squash 100%" mean in the notes?
Patiently waiting to see where SS lands...
ST scrapper is simulating a lot less now compared to what was posted a couple of days ago. What happened? Crit rng factors?
Every class that needs a buff needs the same love they gave my mayhem zerker. Such a good update. Hope other classes get similar reworks that need it.
oh shit wait a minute they added a new line to differentiate between spec swift hallu and spec crit salvation master summoner. kinda interesting to note actually
interesting that one of the S-tier dps (barrage arty) is middle of the pack in terms of sustained dps and burst
Interesting how I’ve seen Perfect Suppression being stronger than Demonic Impulse for awhile but very rarely do I see PS over DI.
I miss in every dps simulation or tier list eso 4 spender sadge :(
No way the barrage sim is accurate we all know that class pumps in 6-8s
Another chart showing results on unrealistics scenarios what we already know.  Entropy being ahead again, considering a static target with the butt on their faces, which happens only in Trixion.   A missed Surge can classifies DB with Figther title on MVP screen.  Anyway, I reconize your effort in this chart, but if your objective was to show "the best DPS spec" this cant be considered a trusted pratical source.
Again this useless sim...
Where is eso wd??????
This shit makes no sense... How come RS soulfist burst window including awakening isn't on top and is behind summoner? And how come Firepower burst windows are almost identical to Barrage?   While this list is probably correct for popular classes, they must have picked wrong skills or rotation for other classes.
Would be funny to see expected missed chart damage for burst classes. Where you subtract maybe 1-2 surges from their rotations in a given amount of time. Or 1-2 Ignites in a given amount of time, to see how much dps they lose in real time lmao. I would assume chunky burst classes would do far worse than high rotational characters like hitmasters, if they too were to miss a few to in a given amount of time in a comparative state. Would be very nice to also see expected cost per dps on average. To see which classes are the best bang for you buck.
This is such trash info...doesnt' tell us anything reliable. Only the 6-10second windows are helpful info.  They just need to do 2 tests for back attackers and average the dps out for 50-60% back attack uptime.     edit: Some of you are hard headed. Landing 100% back attacks during every buff rotation? You will only get 50-60% of these numbers in raids like brel.
hiding igniter sorc on bottom hmm
My SS ignored yet again.....
How to misread the chart; "Pistoleer does more DPS than Igniter!"
Igniter Trash DPS 😭😭😭  Pistoleer Players start gatekeeping them
Haven't played since launch and hit 1370 then bailed, but lord makes me sad seeing sorc's that low
Praying for Arcana. I’m deciding to build 5x3 on either emp or Emp.
Takeaway is slayer is broken. Both burst and sustained damage are top tier.
Gravity training boys where u at
Where can I find his mayhem build?
perfect suppression gang
someone tell that guys WHERE IS THE SHARPSHOOTER.
Anyone have the excel sheet so we can sort different columns?
wait how is control and taijutsu so high? their %'s in every column seem pretty mediocre.. lol
this shit again
Don't even play this game anymore due to the staggering amount of chores, but seeing this chart makes me glad that I got out. The amount of disproportion in this chart is ridiculous. Having a class doing 3x the amount of damage for a relevant time (6 sec) compared to another is absolute garbage balancing. Even if we look at ideal circumstances and infinite time to dps, lowest DPS class still gets absolutely destroyed by the top one (60% difference)... the difference is absolutely ludicrous.
Sorry to all the classes on this chart. Sharpshooters: we're just simply too good to be included, we're off the charts baby!
Hunger better than lunar? Big oof
Zerker numbers looking pretty insane
big KEK about igniter sorceress being that low  Did they smoke weed ?
My math is not mathing. Slayer 6s DPS 70+M Deathblade surge 6s DPS 36M. Why DB is the first? Slayer literally deals twice as much dmg like DB in 6s why DB is first?
So based on this surely we will get buffs for the weakest 10
Arcanist who? 😂👌
This test has flaws at face value. Not including basic attack weaving alters total dps for several classes, & does not account for awakenings in cases of 6/8's burst.     Looking at the original post: Igniter Sorceress is only getting 1 doomsday off during testing of 10s which explains the low numbers.      OG Post: [https://www.inven.co.kr/board/lostark/4821/88870](https://www.inven.co.kr/board/lostark/4821/88870)
Still waiting
Its under 15 holy bible
Its there, just right below CR Gunlancer
the ones not on the chart is because the guy doesn't have the chars in his roster to test. he had a poll up a bit ago to ask the peeps what missing class we would like to see added || idk what the outcome was.
Under perfect circumstances Empress probably even dwarfs Slayer. The problem is. You would have to parse with her 100 times to get a decent average. Because of that inven video showing that fished rng rotation having Empress do 47 million dps. For example. That is not normal or average haha  Emperor is a lot less rng reliant but still at the mercy of cull & sovereign. Just a much higher draw rate. Would still have to parse a ton to average out.  Edit: Also, Gunslinger can’t get an accurate reading of dps either from full health. So this shouldn’t be “the end all” of any evaluation.
Didn't a Arcana get MVP in first Hell Brel clear? Probably a good sign of how good there damage is. lol
That’s is a very strange take imo. Most hit master classes are mechanically more challenging and getting the most out of them relies on more than decent positioning.  The best example of this would be hell raids. Surgeblade, despite being severely hindered by equalised gems, is able to consistently keep up with and, on higher end of play, outperform pm gs despite pm benefiting from the equalised gems.  The issue stems from the sheer vastness of the skill gap. Any buff to entropy and they beat hm by leaps and bounds in higher end play. Yet despite this people still complain about the dodgy balancing. I personally believe that smilegate handle this issue very well.  A perfect example of this is the recent gs buff. Although the dps increase is incredibly minor it allows lesser skilled players to not be animation locked for as long, therefor be safer and not have to cancel skills as often, whereas in higher level play it leaves gs largely unaffected.  Smilegate seem to be very aware of this skill disparity and are not willing to buff entropy due to it.
we already know it's SS(sharpshooter) tier
Still no eso wd :/
7 max skills 6 max skills ig?
should be number of dmg skills for predator build, not sure wat drops for wat though
Heavenly Squash is the old name for Celestial Palm. Probably means all 4 palms hit? Not too familiar with SF mechanics.
If all the Buddha hands hits basically which is pretty hard to do in raids that is not valtan.
Probably bottom 5 despair.
Wondering this as well
BT zerker still need more love tho
This chart is for 100% entropy uptime, naturally hit master classes fall behind.
These charts are made by one guy. We have no idea of his programming competence or his ability to create and implement a proper rotation for each class.  These graphs have FPE close in sustained damage and higher in burst damage, when in reality barrage crushes it in everything but stagger. So something is obviously not right with the simulation.  I don't mind though - if they make barrage arti look weaker than reality it helps me since nerfs seem largely based on player perception of the classes rather than their true strength.
This list is mostly useless...and most of the redditors are falling for the big numbers. Some of them can't even back attack half the time and assume these numbers are helpful for them. Reality is, you will most likely only ever get 60-70% of these numbers as really good player in real scenarios. Holding cooldowns, waiting for checks, mechs, etc..so many things take  up your time.
longest window they check is 10s awakening, i think dbl barrage rotation with awakaning takes a bit longer and im pretty sure arti is one of the top classes in t hat window, also i wouldnt call the 190% in 10s window middle of the pack its more top end
Brain dead easy to play that's why, your average player will do well with it.
I'm a PS main. But the reality is that this chart does a huge disservice to DI by giving everyone full Lv10 gems. One of DI's biggest advantages is that you only need 2 gems. The downside to that is that you have a lower ceiling, which is what you see here.  I imagine that if instead we gave every character a fixed gem budget that allowed for \~700k gold to be spent (1x Lv10 DMG+CD or Full Lv8s) that DI would show much better relative performance. And the reality is that players do have a limited budget!
This is assuming 100% uptime on back attacks.
you're watching PS alts play with demonic mains probably
Barrage sim probably doesn’t take the w bonus when they are staggered which is most of the burst windows.  Also artillerist dps is usually cracked because they can ignore several patterns and keep dpsing that other classes can’t.  In raw dps this seems about right.
I agree. Charts like this are so divorced from the reality of an actual raid scenario, its pretty useless information at the end of the day.     If you made an actual raid tier list it wouldn't align with the placements in this chart at all imo
This isn’t trixion either, it’s a step beyond it.  It’s fully simulated and has things you can’t adjust in trixion like weapon quality or party synergies.
This comment can't stop me cause I can't read. DPM charts are the Bible. Gatekeep gunlancers are artilerists.
Also doesn't include ideal synergy for Entropy users. For some reason they get 100% uptime on back attack instead..
I doubt that. The number on the spirit bomb is satisfying, but as a RS, your lv 3 hype make everything does a lot of damage. The time you spent charging the spirit bomb could've been spent going though your rotations under the massive damage buff, and if you compared the expected damage of the spirit bomb vs. your normal rotation in that same time frame, you'd be surprised that the difference isn't as great as you think.
Burst classes actually do BETTER in actual combat because of how boss mechanics work out.
It's not though, you know that you can calculate yourself, they gave you the numbers for 100% uptime on the back/front, not everyone knows that's not possible but with that number you are able to calculate the dgm you would have with 50-60% (also wtf 50% uptime on the back is super low if that's all you can do then you shoudl probably swap to hit master or support :p)
You still see classes like Shock Scrapper way below for backattackers.    You also see some constant dps uptime classes a bit too low in my opinion (edit: Gunslinger/glavier are probably ~fine but loose a lot of value in fights with many burstwindows and no constant dps uptime anyways).
Hiding?  It's ranked based on consistant overall damage which igniter sorc is shit at.
Well I like the 10s DPS chart too
This is sorted by sustained DPS, Igniter has second highest burst after Slayer who is considered overtuned in KR, IIRC, and there’s a large gap between second and third place.
This is why this graph is dangerous. You aren't understanding it very well.  Look over at some of the burst numbers. The only competitive class with sorc is slayer(which isn't even out in the west). And when it comes to doing damage in all of the raids atm burst is king.
I can't speak about Tai but control pumps damage specially after its been buffed. Problem with control is that is a swiftness entropy so you need 100% uptime and 100% to even see these numbers.
And yet hit master classes are said to be meta, and you can try and explain me how you could ever tell that by looking at this chart. I'll wait.
Well the difference is small. While the 10sec DPS difference isn't small.
Ah good to know, thanks!
Whatever your thoughts on this stuff, you gotta admit this is a really impressive effort.
Problem is he isn't parsing but rather running a simulation so arcana is extremely hard to simulate since her damage number are all over the place due to card rng.
>Edit: Also, Gunslinger can’t get an accurate reading of dps either from full health. So this shouldn’t be “the end all” of any evaluation.  Just FYI, the sim already factors in average damage based on boss HP for the PM engraving and tripods on Catastrophe/Perfect Shot
MVP included number from all pull, during prog if you’re consistently last one standing even Blue GL can get Cruel Fighter MVP
Is that 4spender?
Correct, 7m refers to 7 maxed.  Gunslingers have a build referred to as "7m" as well.  16 abilities between Pistols, Shotguns and Rifles, but only 7 are in the primary rotation for damage.  Everything else is utility
it would probs be the movement ability
Shouldn’t be. 50/50 LC is one of the stronger classes now :/
LC is literally top 5 class in korea for both hell and normal content now lol  Deathstrike is fairly average
Huh? Loyal Companion absolutely trucks now man. What planet are you on?
Really does. Feels weird dealing similar amount of damage as a mayhem zerk through the duration of my burst/transformation then having my damage fall off a cliff for 15/20 seconds.
It also doesn't factor in layering buffs during burst windows or building meter during damage reduction. Hence why sorc is on the bottom for average DPS but still a top tier class.  All this list really does is highlight how hilarious busted slayer is.
Yeah I dont trust this list at all
FPE and Barrage do seem a bit odd, but with buffs to FPE, and new equipment/synergy. Having 100% buff uptime just benefits Sustain more. Part of why Ignitor is on bottom end, is they are building meter most the test when every other class is dpsing for free.
thats a brain dead take so much so im not even gonna spell it out
good point but this chart displays dps at max potential (it assumes 100%  front/back attack rate lol) not so much realistic dps.
Very good point
I get 90%+ BA rate in Brel, with the majority of my non-back attacks as attacks that just don't matter (builders). So I don't think that is a major issue.  &#x200B;  Edit: You can downvote but meter doesn't lie lmao
Yeh if feel like this is the same with EO soul fist, hard to add it’s synergy, triple flash, energy release, hype 3 and Class engrave buffs all for these sims. Cause we all know barrage does more than this so I assume it’s the same issue for EO.
The only thing this chart proves is that slayer is overpowered, extremely high dps while having igniter lvl bursts. Predator keeping parse with mayhem also leads to believe that it's executioner that is heavily overperforming.
This is a misconception. You still gain a significant damage increase by using the bomb. During a regular rotation, you use all skills once and then wait for cooldowns for your second cycle during hype. During a bomb rotation you still use Merciless Pummel, Heavenly Squash, and Energy Blast without Energy Release buffing them before the bomb and then wait for cooldowns as usual.  Details. A bomb cycle takes 12 seconds so that's what I'll use here. These 12 seconds include 2x FS, BC, Hype, EB, HS, MP, ER, Bomb. If you don't bomb, you get 2x FS, BC, Hype, ER, EB, HS, MP, FO, SB/CB in those same 12 seconds. The second half of your hype is slightly truncanted if you bomb, but it's highly dependant on your ER cd gem. You can still get off everything except the second force orb in the second half.  Numbers. Due to time constraints, sample size is only 5 for all tests.      Standard 12s cycle: 96m       Bomb w/o crit: 57m       Bomb w/ crit: 141m       Cycle w/o bomb crit: 108m       Cycle w/ bomb crit: 191m  As you can see, your damage almost doubles if you crit. If you don't crit, your damage still increases. You lose about half your damage from truncating your rotation for the bomb, but the bomb is guaranteed to do more than that (if it hits). If we average the crit rate for the bomb, we get 96m vs 157m when comparing no bomb to bomb.  All numbers are without synergies, dark bombs, atrophines, etc. With a single crit synergy, the balance tips highly in the bomb's favor.
only when overgeared
When comparing inflated numbers you have to lower your expectations by a lot, you want a range for the Dps. It's safe to assuming 1 out of 2 rotations will be a back attack during buffs. You don't see every dps perfectly line up with buffs. Hence why you do 50-60% during BUFF rotations.  Perfect synergy uptime ? hello?
GS is top tier as a sustain damage class though? it's very very strong
It's actually way higher up in the list because support buffs and antropines isn't factored in.
Yah I didnt even read it tbh just went top to bottom lol thats better then 😎
Nah you have to keep in mind in this chart which classes made these DPS score as back attacker/front or hit master .  Because Trixion is unfair
What exactly isn't clear? I am not quite sure which classes are hit master, but looking at the 6s DPS chart Igniter, Deathblow, Summoner, Gunslinger look to be up there with current released classes in EU/NA. And I am quite sure those have been meta for the longest time now, since raids tend to be in short burst dps phases instead of constant dps.
is that the case for hell mode only? It use to be like that for normal mvp but then mvp got changed to per encounter a while ago
1, 2, 3 hallu, 3 entropy, 4hallu, 4 entropy  Wd has a lot of builds lol
50/50 swift crit or spec crit?
I love it. Really revived my outlook on SS but who knows where it’ll show on the chart
Is LC stronger than DS now? I'm gearing mine towards DS but i always liked the playstyle of LC a bit more, though i did find it a bit too fast at one point.
Only 3rd highest constant dps and 1st highest burst. Smilegate should do better and buff her so she can be the 1st highest dps too
The buff uptime helps barrage more than FPE.  Not only is 2 seconds more relevant for barrage (33% longer window to refresh for Barrage), the firepower buff is much stronger for Barrage as well (75-80% increased damage vs 30% + FPE engraving).
Why comment then? Don't bother  Very Good damage, very easy to play, does well with people with no hands, not hard to guess why it's strong for most players.  Or are you an Arti main coping on the difficulty ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)
I agree. I'm just noting how this chart varies from what you would see in a realistic sample of PF players.
I mean igniter is literally bottom 3, burst really helps characters stay competing with entropies. Also this gives entropy 100% so their set is overperforming by a lot
I didn’t know “antropines” were Sorc exclusive?
Is that not obvious to anyone else but the one I'm replying to?
If they change how the MVP work you can disregard my comment, but when I was running hell mode months ago that’s how it work
Crit spec.
Well you’re double-y in luck. LC definitely is stronger now and the stronger builds are spec/crit so its not nearly as spammy as the swift builds.
that would be slayer
i just hope people dont look at this chart and assume the classes at the bottom are worse...
It benefits igniter sorcs way more than it does on any other class so in theory it would increase its dps ranking. just simple logic.
The MVP system was updated ages ago and now only includes damage from the boss (so ignores trash) and only from the last pull.
Good thing the DS books were cheap, though now it makes sense.  I shall change at once!
In some ways they are worse. But as said, unless you're comparing full gems to full gems, there's already an important point of nuance there. And atleast personally, I'll accept someone with full Lv7, but I'll deny a DI with only 2 Lv7
Guardian raids have never been gated by any quests, just ilvl
Jumping on this thread to ask the same about 1540 & 1560 chaos dungeons. Is there a story we need to do for those or we can get straight in?
no only condition for guardians is beating previous ones at least once and ilvl
Yes, it always has been. But I was a little surprised because the area was different (the area I had never seen before). Thank you!
It's still south vern, so yes you can jump straight in
> beating previous ones  that has been removed like 6 months ago or so
For monkey yes, but the guardians after it will require elgacia story.
The lore of Monkey is that it's from Anikka.
Some guardians get new areas. They arent tied to anything tho.   The frog Korea got some time ago also is in a new zone. No question requirements tho
Thanks!
This was real fun when they released deskaluda and ppl were begging for carries in velganos lfg
Yeah don't have to worry about than till the 1580 chaos with Elgacia.
Yeah I almost quit the game cause I’m bad and couldn’t beat Velganos over leveled… I eventually got it tho lol
Doing velganos with other ppl was probobly the most miserable experience ive had in this game, even worse than progging water dungeon. I still solo him when he shows up in challenge rotation
Can't blame you for this, it is the single worst fight in the entire game and that includes all other guardians, legion raids and abyss dungeons I've done on ilevel. I beat him exactly once right before Deskaluda came out with overleveled (~1420) group and never came back. His normal attack patterns and pizza are fine but the black rain vomit all over the place combined with terrible map that won't let you maneuver properly is what makes it annoying af. Punishing group play in an MMO by making players compete with each other for buffs is also just dumb design.
It could be true tbh. I got jailed in a g2 because their "prokel" a CO Summoner consistently died at 80 bars. Then the backup prokel consistently died at 40 bars. Before the backup backup prokel have a 50/50 chance of killing the remainder. We wiped over and over for an hour or more.
can't tell if trolling or if salty cause they didn't get accepted? thonkge  either way, man if you feel the need to boycott another lobby in a title then you probably need to go take a walk or something
What's prokel?
Yesterday I was doing a g2 with my 1496 SS and I'm able to solo prokel, but the 1540 WD insisted on doing it. I did more damage that them but when I went in I got the invisible prokel glitch. After that the WD died on 40 bars and I finished it off in a couple of seconds.
Last week the designated prokel died and after the gate confessed he not only never did it on that class, it was the first time he played it and he is on the friends account
The heck is a prokel?
As soon aa I see ''CO Summoner'', the scenario suddenly emerges in my mind :)
hahahaha euc? if you leave prokel to reset stacks, there is a bug that he goes invisible forever if a mob spawns while the soloist is out. and for co summoner, that makes them almost completely useless except literally 2 very slow skills. for any class that's bad anyways. and the party outside had crappy dps to kill the other bosses, so for an on ilvl char, darkness for 30+sc is a big deal. i think you were in a party with me as the prokeleer lol.
Depends, i had one week someone join a group (last person) saying he can do Prokel to then after G1 was done to say he cant, that he 'misunderstood' jailing everyone.    So if that's the reason I kinda admire the guy for trying to prevent people getting jailed
If you see party disband at G2 it's not troll. And most likely Mr "I prokel" Never did it before not even in trixion. From my experience people are pretty generous with prokel attempts so he had to do extremely poorly
When you being lied to about having prokel only to be jail necause they dont then you would understand the fristration. I got jailed in g2 for couple time because of that and these day stuck in g2 is rough
I think it's neither. My best guess would be that raid 1 is a guild run with too much patience and the raid leader failed prokel too many times for the support's liking (which, 1 week before brel hard, is pretty reasonably "2 times", prokel killers should not be failing prokel), the support jumped ship and made their own raid, the guild run is just trying to find any fill to keep beating their heads against a wall.
How pathetic is it tho that out of 7 people no one can prokel?
How you know he didn't do that, left his pc on and went for a walk?
a mini boss fight in brel gate2 (one person fights the boss in another instance while the other 7 "outside" do other mechanics)
I think is some kind of food.
“guys im not actually bad, im just a shitty person”
Boss in Brelshaza Gate 2. One person goes to another arena to fight the body, everyone else fights its head in another arena. The head does wipe mechs based on the remaining health of the body.
CO Summoner is actually pretty easy to Prokel in...
It's G2. They're already jailed.
Yeah, back in the day when T2 was the highest content for the majority of people I had a guy in the water dungeon that kept failing orbs and wiping us. We tried everything for over 15 minutes to communicate with him and explain the mech and he didn't react at all and kept starting the fight.  We were forced to disband and when I opened PF he made a lobby with title "know mech".  I didn't do another lobby with warning people, but if someone else did it would've been justified
idk maybe it's just me then - i would just leave and try and set up or join a lobby at another time. i don't really like going out of my way to jeopardise other people whether or not they were in the wrong. cause the ss doesn't tell us exactly who was right or wrong - there's not enough context for me to just assume that lobby 1 actually had a jailer. ultimately if i were a random person i would join neither lobbies
Not everyone need to be good in everything like you.
"mini boss". More like the main thing while 7 other people hit an actual afk mini boss
No, that's Poke. You're thinking of to move forward or onward.
But he might prevent someone else from joining and getting jailed as well
> Yeah, back in the day when T2 was the highest content for the majority of people I had a guy in the water dungeon that kept failing orbs and wiping us.  Alaric pugs when everyone was new was absolutely brutal, much harder than week 1 Argos pugs to my memory.
Prokel is easy af tho, you don’t need to be good. Everyone that can’t’ do it are just lazy people who don’t wanna bother even trying it.
No, that’s progress. You’re thinking of a flammable hydrocarbon gas.
CO Summoner has more easier time to Prokel over MS Summoner though.  CO can literally kill Prokel by just kiting the fuck out of him and just pressing the actives of her pets, MS can only take advantage of Maririn and still needs to hit and use Akir.
You don't understand what getting jailed means. The raid is set to G2--**anyone** joining their raid is **already** jailed. If the raid really doesn't have a prokel killer, then any new joiner is just going to "stay" jailed, not "get" jailed. Because being outside of a raid at G2 progress is, itself, the jail.
people like you are the reason this game can't attract new players, keep it up and then cry when it dies in a few years
No, that's petrol. You're thinking of those chips that come In a tube.
While possible, it will take forever. Majority of CO's damage comes from spear. Maririn is great for Prokel, though.
Oh yeah, hang yourself up on 1 word lol. Does it really matter if I say get jailed or stay jailed? Holy fuck
How does me saying someone is being lazy about learning a fight = I am anti new player. I am literally hosting learning groups because my friend is new so I invited all mokokos to join us. What did you do to accommodate new players?   If you don’t know prokel you are lazy. You don’t want to bother spending time in trixion learning his moves because you always count on someone else doing it. That is literally a fact, this is why we have people 7 months after clown release who can’t do Mario 3 and 4, and are clueless about the bingo phase because they always wait for someone to ping them.
No, that's Pringles. You're thinking of a shrimplike marine crustacean.
How hard is saying "oh, I misunderstood" for you?
To be fair tho, I know the prokel fight but I still wouldn’t do it on some of my characters, like my shock scrapper for example. That stuff feels a little too slow for me to fight him
The other logical conclusion is not that they are lazy but they themselves know they are bad at it.   You can do prokel and you find it easy, but that doesn’t mean everyone does.   Gotta look outside of just your perspective.
No, that's a prawn. You're thinking of a person who monitors students during an examination.
Because I didnt? It really doesnt matter if I say "prevent from getting jailed" or "prevent from staying jailed". Legit same shit.
I don't agree. There are practice modes for anyone to get better at the fight. I believe without a doubt practice will make every player better, and at some point with practice you still can't prokal, much of the game will be difficult.   I feel the same about Mario stages, you can practice those, but rarely does anyone do so. Anyone who does can do all the Mario's, but there are still plenty who only mario during the real raid and fail. Even 10-15 minutes would make a difference.
No, that's a professor. You're thinking of a fruit or a princess.
All parties involved (whether it's a player looking for a g2 group or a party looking to fill a g2 group) are jailed.   Saying "getting jailed as well" implies they aren't jailed and the other person is trying to "prevent" that from happening.  That's the misunderstanding.
You are right, the practice usually does lead to better proficiency. I believe there is a cap to that though.   The cap is either physical or mental and that hinders actual gains to improvement. Either they physically are not able to react to things or a mental block (lack of confidence or stage freight doing it in live situation).  Some people may end up being a back up at best. It’s not always that they are lazy but they know they aren’t going to be good enough, either at the moment or ever.   Some easy things like Mario 123 I believe are no excuse however. There are numerous videos guides telling you how to trivialize m2 and m3 and you can turn off your brain and follow the pattern.
You can be jailed inside and outside of the raid.   And being jailed inside of the raid is arguably worse.  Yall are just looking for things to get an argument started when there is non to be had.
I agree with your points however I don't believe that cap is below prokal level. It's a relatively stright forward fight that most if not all of the playerbase can do with a little practice. Sure there is always some anxiety when you're fighting something 1 on 1 with no help, but I find it's much more scripted then even guardian raids.   With this said, some classes are better suited for prokal than others, the learning curve for Igniter is much high than reflux as you can whiff doomsdays all day if you're not looking for set long patterns.
